CSD) Board of Directors released a statement which made clear that racism has no place in the Isla Vista community, Board President Spencer Brandt said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution outlined the I.V. CSD’s goal to “[improve] the quality of life, health, and safety of our Black and brown residents” and to ensure that policing contracts promote racial equity, the resolution read. It also calls on local law enforcement to take steps to eliminate racial disparities in the criminal justice system as a whole.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On June 1, Black Lives Matter Santa Barbara released a </span><a href=\"https://www.juneteenthsb.com/community-news/community-demands\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">set of demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> calling on the Santa Barbara City Council to adopt a resolution condemning police brutality and declaring racism a public health emergency. The City Council passed the resolution soon after, and the I.V. CSD followed suit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the resolution did not outline specific measures to take towards the outlined goals, I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman proposed </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yI06FdJ4fav87g7UrBRss8ASB0FuT21NIHmhCEP61rE/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amendments</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the resolution that documented a number of instances of police brutality throughout the country, instances of riots and over-policing in I.V. and calls to limit the use of force by police, among other actions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The big problem is that people come to us and they say, ‘Black Lives Matter,’ and we say we agree and then do we do anything?” Freeman explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And so what are we going to do?” he asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to concretely address the issues raised, the I.V. CSD also passed a working group to create an I.V. action plan and to consider Freeman’s proposals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a working group set up that is going to be researching solutions, collaborating with the Black community and other stakeholders in our community to present an action plan or tangible things when it comes to making much-needed reforms to the law enforcement system,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the following I.V. CSD meeting on June 23, the board presented a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVQo0_wvfurPIK0fOGKKUrbnWMBWeM74N7UVXB2DE8Y/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the working group’s actions thus far. The report centered around research on alternative methods of response to crisis calls in I.V., as opposed to the usual police response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the programs cited was the </span><a href=\"https://whitebirdclinic.org/services/cahoots/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CAHOOTS</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">program used in Eugene, Oregon — the location of the University of Oregon — in which a medic and a crisis worker with mental health training respond to crisis calls, including housing issues, non-emergency medical situations and substance abuse, among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The working group also looked into the possibility of a sobering center in I.V. as an alternative to jail time for alcohol-related offenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How come the only tool that we have to deal with some of these problems in our community, whether its cause is related to homelessness [or] mental health, are responded to by law enforcement officers? Do we really need armed officers responding to calls like that? Do we really need armed officers responding to noise complaint calls? I don’t think so,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those calls can be responded to by people who are more of a social worker or mediator type,” he continued. “The goal of providing mental health services, especially for those who are in mental health crisis, is much more important than trying to come in with the badge and the gun.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD also passed a 60-day extension for the negotiation of the interpersonal violence investigator contract during its June 23 meeting. In the resolution condemning police brutality, the board aims to “ensure that policing services contracted for by the District are conducted in a manner that promotes racial justice and equity.” The extension would serve to grant the extra time to account for any changes, according to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt also emphasized reaching out to various stakeholders — centered around the voices of Black people and other people of color — in the community as the process of policy change continues. The working group is also presenting reports to the Isla Vista Community Network, an organization with a number of representatives from around the I.V. community, to gain more feedback for projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really going to require the community to really be behind some of these reforms to make them actually happen. We need to keep the community pressure up on our public safety and justice system to change because that’s the only way true change is going to happen,” Brandt said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-86162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The services offered caters specifically to families and students living in I.V. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goleta City Council chose the unorthodox suite of library resources from four options proposed by staff from the Goleta Valley Library, which were based on an outreach project funded by </span><a href=\"https://theharwoodinstitute.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Harwood Institute for Public Innovation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a nonprofit organization which aims to develop relationships and social progress in communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outreach project has been the driving force in helping library staff determine what the community wants to see in a library for I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Harwood Institute] trained us in holding conversations with people to assess what their aspirations were for library services from Goleta Library,” Goleta Valley Library Director Allison Gray said at the meeting. “Altogether, we had 14 outreaches and we spoke with about 720 people — over 600 of whom were from the Isla Vista area.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside the hybrid option, the library also proposed a bookmobile, a fully serviced branch and a reading room as options. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chosen option for a hybrid-style library includes multiple pop-up services, such as book vending machines, book drops, pop-up libraries — where people can download e-books — and a cargo van, which will bring books into I.V. and deliver them to people who have placed books on hold. The van, which is planned to operate for 40 hours each week, could also hold programming and host events either outside or at available spaces throughout I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a great option because it’s actually offering personal library service. It’s like catered library service [for] people so they’d be getting the best individual service of anyone in our community,” Gray said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another benefit of the hybrid option is its affordability, according to Gray. Assemblymember Monique Limón, who represents the 37th district that includes parts of Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, secured $200,000 for library services in I.V. through state funding, which would more than cover the $154,196 needed for the hybrid option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) offered space for a Reading Room — a quiet space to read or study —  through the I.V. Community Room and the I.V. Community Center, in addition to the hybrid library option in a letter sent to the Goleta City Council on April 6. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the timeline to implement the program has stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic, I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said he’s hopeful that the program will be ready to kick off when California’s stay-at-home order is lifted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a huge step forward. Isla Vista has never had its own library, however, we pay $200,000 worth of taxes for a local library every year,” Brandt said.“I’m really glad that we are set to have a physical location.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

continue their work, it must be conducted remotely until the outbreak is contained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers were given two days to cease any ongoing on-campus research, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.research.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/docs/covid-19/Shutdown-of-All-On-Campus-Research-3-18-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">memo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Incandela sent out on March 18. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The shutdown of on-campus research will create unanticipated delays, which can be cause for significant anxiety for many, and especially junior, researchers,” Incandela wrote in the memo.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While there is no way to escape the loss of time, every effort is being made to assure that these actions will not damage careers or lead to excessive financial hardship,” he continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the memo does provide some exceptions to the remote research mandate, including those who are researching coronavirus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Requests to allow COVID-19 studies or the continuation of ongoing essential experiments” can be submitted through a form for consideration, the memo read, but “few exceptions [are] to be granted.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research equipment, such as chemicals, are not allowed to be taken off campus. For laboratories or equipment that require continued maintenance or activity, the memo asks researchers to “spell out why and what continued tasks are necessary and identify a minimum number of essential personnel who will be responsible for this critical maintenance.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incandela said funding for researchers’ pay was a concern early on, but that the federal</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> agencies, which provide most of the funding for researchers, would continue to fund research now conducted at home. </span><a href=\"https://www.research.ucsb.edu/covid-19-guidance-proposals-and-awards\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New information</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding employee wages is being made available to researchers as well, Incandela said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mahdi Abu-Omar, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry whose research focuses on renewable energy, said that despite the shutdown, there’s still a lot of work to be done.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re experimentalists, but there’s work that we do offline in terms of writing papers and preparing and planning and processing data,” Abu-Omar said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course not being able to do experiments is holding us back a little bit. But [writing and preparing data] for the next several weeks is manageable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the coronavirus outbreak, Abu-Omar had been anticipating the arrival of a scientist and a professor from overseas this summer, but after UCSB’s research shutdown, “both of these jobs are postponed until we figure out what’s going on,” Abu-Omar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the shuttering of research on campus, there are still alternatives for student researchers, such as proposing ideas for future projects, Incandela said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students can read and learn a lot about how the research they planned to do is connected to previous results. This is just one example, and I am sure there are many other possibilities like running simulations or brain-storming about something completely new,” Incandela explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This may be an unprecedented period of thought and reflection that brings many new ideas to campus for future research.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Yang sent out an email Tuesday afternoon notifying students about the case in Isla Vista, adding that the case was “a previously confirmed case of COVID-19 [which] was found to be located within the boundaries of the Isla Vista community” after the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department began using GIS mapping to identify confirmed cases.</p>\n<p>“<strong>We have no indication that this case involves anyone affiliated with UC Santa Barbara</strong>, but given the proximity of Isla Vista to campus, the number of our students who live in Isla Vista, and our faculty and staff who live in Isla Vista or adjacent communities, we wanted to notify our campus community of this development,” Yang wrote.</p>\n<p>Yang also added that two people affiliated with UCSB who live together tested positive for coronavirus after one returned from Europe on March 13.</p>\n<p>“<strong>Both individuals have not been on campus and have been in self-quarantine since March 13.</strong> They currently remain in self-quarantine off campus and are recovering,” Yang wrote.</p>\n<p>At the Monday afternoon press conference, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henning Ansorg, the Santa Barbara Public Health Department public health officer, said the rise in cases in Santa Barbara County had been expected by the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The increase in numbers is very typical for a virus that spreads quickly from person to person. We expected a doubling of cases within three days and that is almost exactly what we have seen,” Ansorg said. “It is an indicator of just how infectious this thing is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to slow the continued rise of cases and mitigate the spread of the virus, Ansorg also emphasized the necessity of social distancing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only definitive factor which makes a substantial difference between the best and worst case scenario is how much community members stay physically isolated from each other. Continuing with our current efforts of social distancing will make all the difference,” Ansorg said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Ansorg did not specifically mention the I.V. case during the conference, it was announced about two hours later through the Santa Barbara Public Health Department </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBCPublicHealth/status/1244799094272471042\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter account.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the confirmation of an I.V. coronavirus case, the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) issued a state of emergency in I.V. at its March 24 virtual meeting, strongly urging the county to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to take all necessary actions to slow the spread of COVID-19.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now that we have a case of COVID-19 in Isla Vista, it is time for Isla Vistans to take social distancing seriously. This is a public health crisis that will affect not just our older folks — it will affect student-aged individuals too,” I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said in an interview on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In accordance with federal, state and local mandates ordering social distancing and banning gatherings of more than 10 people, the district also urged Isla Vistans at its meeting to avoid any mass gatherings, including Deltopia — the yearly unsanctioned street party held on the first weekend of spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V.

Faculty were tasked with piecing together curriculum for online courses in only two weeks’ time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dunbar said that one of the major problems brought by the transition to remote instruction is UCSB’s lack of experience teaching online classes. The first time the Department of Communication ever offered an online major class was last year, when the University of California Office of the President offered grants for faculty to develop online courses, according to Dunbar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It took me months to prepare it. I video recorded lectures, I thought carefully about pedagogy and how faculty can teach online without meeting the students,” Dunbar explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, with the pressure of all classes being taught online, the time to carefully develop courses is quickly dwindling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To just [prepare online courses] instantly overnight … We are not going to have that same kind of thoughtful pedagogy. It’s basically like, ‘What can we do to make sure that students get the information that we want them to get and what can we do to do the best that we can for students without letting them fall through the cracks?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dunbar said there is going to be a lot of trial and error for professors as they experiment with new tools and instruction methods that some have never used before, like Zoom for example. To aid one another in the transition to digital classrooms, professors across the country have even created a Facebook group — aptly named </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2528669267346197/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pandemic Pedagogy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — to ask for teaching advice and to share tips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenge of moving classes online is further complicated by the ongoing </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/breaking-ucsb-graduate-students-vote-to-begin-full-strike-on-thursday-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost-of living adjustment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (COLA) strikes from graduate students across the UC system. At UCSB, graduate students have been striking since Feb. 27 to demand a COLA to offset high housing costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question remains as to how graduate students striking for COLA — some of whom have ceased all grading, office hours and teaching — will adjust in the move to online classes. Dunbar said she believes each faculty member will handle the situation differently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, language departments and programs face a unique problem as instructors struggle to find a way to translate rigorous, interactive and almost daily instruction into a digital platform, according to Valentina Padula, coordinator of the Italian Language Program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Padula said the program has an advantage compared to other language courses thanks to hybrid online classes that were already being offered by the department. Elements from the hybrid classes, such as visual materials and grammar tutorials, will be implemented into the fully online classes, Padula said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for regular lectures, Padula said that instructors will most likely use Zoom to teach classes. Instructors can also use Zoom to conduct various break-out sessions and hold dialogues — often required for oral exams — between smaller groups of students before reconvening as a class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some language programs in particular will face even more challenges, such as those that teach an alphabet other than the Latin alphabet, according to Magda Campo, an Arabic language lecturer. For Campo, having students continuously practice writing in Arabic is essential to learning and will be difficult to monitor in online classes, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/facing-a-digital-spring-quarter-ucsb-preps-faculty-for-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoom workshops</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, students can be given the option to use the whiteboard feature to draw the characters of the alphabet to help meet this requirement, Campo said. She also said she is looking into various programs, such as Adobe and ProctorU, to supplement her normal teaching style.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students have to understand that the professors are nervous, that [we] are just trying our best to reassure the students that we will do our best to [teach] via Zoom,” Campo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from remote instruction, a closed UCSB campus means students will also lose access to a number of university resources, such as laboratories, which are needed to carry out experiments in many S.T.E.M. fields.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claudio Campagnari, professor and chair of the Department of Physics, said the department had multiple options for holding remote labs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One option is to provide students with the measurements of the labs and ask for the data analysis, he said. Another option is for students to buy lab kits, conduct the experiments themselves and then later discuss the results via video conferencing, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain courses and upper division labs in the physics department that are normally considered prerequisites will be waived “to protect the students” from not fulfilling requirements needed for graduation, Campagnari said. There will also be the possibility of offering the course labs online during the summer “if things are not back to normal,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Campagnari also voiced concern about managing students all around the world, as time zones, censorship and internet access in different areas can hamper professors’ efforts to teach their students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professors across the departments are attempting to mitigate any possible negative effects on students, particularly those who are graduating. Within the Writing Program, graduating seniors and students relying on financial aid will be given priority for classes, as those two groups will be the most heavily impacted, Madeleine Sorapure, director of the program, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all departments, however, have been able to find alternative solutions to conducting courses amidst UCSB’s campus closure. The Department of Theatre and Dance was forced to cancel some winter quarter finals in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, according to Irwin Appel, professor and chair of the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve used the word ‘heartsick’ a lot because faculty, we were particularly heartbroken to not be able to show the work that students had been working hard on all quarter,” Appel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the initial decision to move to remote instruction until just the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">end of April</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there was still the possibility of holding “a festival of some kind [in May] in our community of all the work that didn’t get to be shown [at the end of winter quarter],” Appel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when the decision to cancel in-person classes was extended through the end of spring quarter, Appel described it as “heartbreaking” and sympathized with the graduating class of 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are so particularly empathizing with seniors,” Appel said. “To go through an entire college career and be looking forward to all the events that happen as a senior, to looking forward to a particular way to leave this university, and to have that snatched away, is really, really profoundly difficult.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

CSD) agreed to house the collective, the IVCC secured a $43,000 grant from the Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) to run the program for slightly less than a year, accounting for breaks throughout the school year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V. CSD, said during the meeting that it is an accomplishment for both the I.V. CSD and the IVCC to be able to run the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a really big win for the compost collective to obtain that source of revenue for almost a full year’s worth of operations, which is a really big deal,” Brandt said. “For us, we’ve stood up here all the time when people come to us with great ideas, which is great. But an idea just by itself without any action doesn’t always materialize into something that’s actually change-making.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVCC serves 96 homes in I.V., collecting composting buckets and delivering compost to gardens throughout I.V with the help of student workers called “dirtriders.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel extremely, extremely relieved and ecstatic that we have found a new home for the compost collective, and I’m very excited for the future,” said Jacob Bider, the current IVCC director and a fourth-year environmental studies major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Bider said he hopes to expand the program’s capabilities to serve more houses; currently, the IVCC has more than 100 houses on its waitlist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did recently request funding [from the </span><a href=\"https://www.fundforsantabarbara.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fund for Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">] for a new cargo trailer that has increased capacity that would allow us to collect more compost, which would allow us to expand the program without having to add more workers,” Bider explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re also looking into the potential of using compostable bags instead of our buckets, which would save us a large amount of time because we wash every bucket after we switch them out for houses.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

So we’re going to keep eyes on it in terms of making sure our community is safe,” Armistead added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said that despite the delays, the planning for the festival did serve to lay the foundation for a festival in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is a silver lining here,” Brandt explained. “We’ve done, essentially, all the legwork that we needed to get to a point where the community festival will become a reality and where we will be able to transition folks into an alternative event that is fun, that is safe and changes the vibe of what’s going on during Deltopia weekend in a significant way for the better.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Thursday’s action marked one </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">full week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since UCSB graduate students began striking. COLA organizers across the UC system called for the one-day strike, asking professors to halt lectures, students to walk out of class and for participants to wear black, hence the name “black-out” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The motto of the UC system is “let there be light,” one speaker said at the Storke Tower noon rally. “When we wear black, it shows the UC administration that without graduate student labor, there is no light.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC-wide work stoppage started early morning on Thursday; at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, protesters blocked all four entrances to Cheadle Hall — UCSB’s administrative building — and stood shoulder-to-shoulder at each entrance. At the front entrance, organizers held a sign that read, “FUCK THE UC! AND A BITCH NAMED JANET.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some administrators who work in Cheadle Hall argued with strikers and attempted to force their way through but were pushed back, sending administrators and staffers circling around the building in hopes of finding another way in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, you guys, I don’t fucking support you. We have to work too,” one employee said to COLA organizers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers continued to refuse to allow administrators to enter into the building, including Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the UC Police Department and administration spoke with protesters, saying they had to move or risk being arrested, organizers regrouped and decided to move inside instead, occupying every floor of the building and chanting, “Don’t cross the picket, don’t be a scab,” to employees as they entered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One undergraduate advisor left his office to explain to strikers that “the students that we see are just as stressed as you are.” After organizers began arguing and chanting — drowning out the advisor</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— Ry Brennan, one of COLA’s de-escalators, came to help defuse the situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brennan and the advisor reached a compromise, in which strikers would be alerted to stay quiet should any undergraduates come into the building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After occupying Cheadle Hall for most of the morning, organizers started to gear up for the noon rally. At approximately 11:30 a.m., students and faculty holding “Faculty for COLA” and “You’re gonna have to fire us too, Janet,” banners marched from Cheadle Hall to Storke Tower and met with demonstrators who had been there since 8 a.m. as part of their regularly scheduled strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Storke Tower, UC worker unions and academic associations expressed their solidarity with and support of UCSB’s COLA movement to an animated crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers representing different unions emphasized a message of solidarity between various unions, all fighting for better treatment from the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a UCSB groundskeeper and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME) Local 3299 member, noted the similarities between the COLA movement and the labor strikes throughout the country, including AFSCME 3299’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">labor fight over the past few years. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every person in this country deserves that security, and that’s why we won’t stop fighting until we have a job that’s worth having and a way to pay rent. You have our support as workers, and I know not a lot of people [from AFSCME] made it out here today because they’re very busy, but I’ve been talking to them at work and you absolutely have our support,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Colvin, Christopher John Newfield, a professor of literature and American studies at UCSB and second vice president of the executive council of the Modern Language Association (MLA) of America, emphasized the MLA’s “unanimous and quite enthusiastic” commitment to support the UC-wide strikers and condemned the termination of UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 1 p.m., the procession of approximately 3,000 marched to Henley Gate, garnering the attention of those on campus as they passed through the Arbor and University Library. Those in “precarious situations,” such as undocumented or international students, were encouraged to walk by organizers wearing red armbands and caution tape, who were designated de-escalators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Henley Gate, the crowd chanted, “Cops off campus, COLA in our bank accounts,” at cars driving by and police officers monitoring the event. Protesters stayed at the gate for nearly 30 minutes before walking back to Storke, where some remained to complete the daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York University sociology professor Andrew Ross visited Santa Barbara to take part in the strike, praising attendees as a catalyst for social change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Graduate student employees are the true conscience of the academic profession, and COLA strikers are the true conscience of the UAW,” Ross said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one deserves to be paid a poverty wage because they love teaching or because they’re training for a job in an academic profession,” he said. “That is not a principle of fair labor, that is a recipe for exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi and Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race for the 3rd District supervisor seat saw a close start between incumbent Joan Hartmann, a registered Democrat and challenger Bruce Porter, who ran with no party in the recent election. The vote-by-mail and mailed ballot results showed Hartmann and Porter nearly tied, with 43.79% and 43.34% of the vote, respectively. Karen Jones lagged behind, with 7.78% of the vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know that as a general rule, Republicans and conservatives vote early and vote by mail. So the fact that I was not behind was a very good [start] for the rest of the [race],” Hartmann said in an interview with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the early tie, Porter said, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were deeply gratified and honored by the support we’ve received in early results. We believe that our message of Independence and commitment to bringing a new voice to all residents resonated deeply with voters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the night went on and precincts began reporting results, Hartmann gained a strong lead as Porter began to fall behind. With 21 of the 49 precincts reporting as of midnight on March 4, Hartmann had 51.77% of the vote, Porter had 35.81% and Jones followed with 6.8%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the county released the semi-official results, Hartmann maintained her lead with 52.26% of the vote, while Porter stayed behind with 35.71%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until the official certified results are released by the Santa Barbara County Elections Division, there is the possibility of the vote continuing to the November general election. For Hartmann to clinch the 3rd District supervisor seat, she must receive 50% plus one of the votes in the primary election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With over 30,000 ballots still to be tallied county-wide, it’s too soon to draw any definite conclusions from the current totals,” Porter said in a statement courtesy of Mathew Burciaga, Porter’s communications director. “The Porter for Supervisor campaign is looking forward to seeing the final results and is preparing for a lively general election in November.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race for the State Assembly seat of the 37th District started and ended with an unwavering  lead, held by lone Republican Charles Cole, who started off with 36.27% of the vote of the vote-by-mail and mailed ballot results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara City Mayor Cathy Murillo followed with 22.44% of the vote, Steve Bennett with 16.82% and Jason Dominguez with 8.68%. Elsa Granados had 5.81% of the vote, Jonathan Abboud had 5.75% and Stephen Blum had 3.89%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all precincts reporting, Cole ended the night with 32.15% of the vote. Abboud, general manager of the Isla Vista Community Services District and longtime resident of I.V., fell behind with 6.89% of the semi-final vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re proud of our campaign staff and volunteers and supporters for running a really strong campaign,” Abboud said in an interview.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we probably did not make the runoff, I’m not going to stop advocating for and working on the issues I ran on, that no other candidate did, like tuition-free public college, the Green New Deal to combat climate change and inequality and affordable housing … The campaign was always about the issues that were not being talked about, not about me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann supported Abboud’s campaign and echoed his sentiments for future plans. “Working with communities to identify their goals and then developing strategies to accomplish those goals. So for I.V. maybe a Green New Deal, you know, how do we bring that about?” Hartmann said. “How do we clearly get better quality housing in I.V. and get the university to build the housing?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the race for State Senator of the 19th District, Democrat Monique Limón and Republican Gary Michaels advanced to a runoff in the November general election, with 56.4% and 38.09% of the vote, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, in the race for House Representative of the 24th District, Democrat Salud Carbajal and Republican Andy Caldwell will also advance to a runoff. Carbajal obtained 52.16% of the vote and Caldwell received 44.11%.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Abrams contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [3/5/2020 11:12 a.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Burciaga as Porter’s campaign manager.

for implementation. </span><em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Ciara Thrower, a third-year environmental studies major, is authoring a proposal to present to the UCSB Academic Senate that would dissolve the requirement and merge it into the World Cultures requirement, after she gained the unanimous support of the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrower said that the European Traditions requirement has a “bad connotation” and has bothered her since her freshman year, as she believes many classes outside the requirement are often Eurocentric.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been looking into [the European Traditions requirement] more and a lot of schools across the country are getting rid of their requirement,” Thrower said in an interview with the Nexus. “And then we’re the only UC that has a requirement like that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with having the general A-E requirements, UCSB also has two requirements in the context of European history under Special Subject Area requirements: the European Traditions requirement and the World Cultures requirement, which includes classes with a focus on “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one or more culture outside of the European tradition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The European Traditions requirement, defined as any class pertaining to “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">early and/or modern European cultures and their significance in world affairs” has been in place since the 80s, according to Harold Marcuse, a German history professor in the history department at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marcuse, the requirement was born out of the World Wars and got a boost by the subsequent Cold War, which was enough to solidify the requirement’s place at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just very Eurocentric,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcuse, who is assisting Thrower in forming the Academic Senate proposal, had pushed to remove the requirement in 2002. According to Marcuse, the current Area E requirement, known as Culture and Thought, was initially split into two sections —  E1 and E2 — one of which was the Western Civilizations requirement, which he called “outdated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the recommendations that we had was to completely get rid of that requirement, but there was a fair amount of resistance from a few departments,” Marcuse said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now courses tend to really fill up no matter what. But back then some departments really lived from student enrollments in the courses they offered that fulfilled that area requirement.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain enrollment in those classes, Marcuse said that the Western Civilizations requirement was converted into an add-on requirement, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now known as the European Traditions requirement, while redefining and updating the various other general education categories and requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also suggestions for an LGBTQ+ and interdisciplinary studies requirements, but both of them failed out of departments’ desire to keep the general education requirements as is, Marcuse added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to change the requirement, Marcuse said there are various paths a proposal would have to take before being considered for implementation. After going through multiple committees — such as the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Committee on Courses and General Education, the Academic Senate and the faculty executive committee — the proposal would have to be vetted by the registrar to determine if it can be implemented, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After receiving feedback from faculty and administration, the proposal would go into a vote in the faculty legislature, a body that encompasses tenured faculty and representatives from the Academic Senate and has the final say on it, according to Marcuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Thrower, however, the first step was garnering support from student organizations on campus, including a resolution through the A.S.

However, the resolution supports abandoning the requirement, which is separate from Thrower’s proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hadidi, a bulk of high school history already revolves around Europe — a redundancy with the European Traditions requirement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we do want to learn about other cultures, we should have that option to do it,” she said, “as opposed to just having a European Traditions where it’s one class, [and] in a World Cultures where it’s another, why not combine the two?” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After gaining the Senate’s approval, Thrower said her next step is to present her proposal to the UCSB Academic Senate on March 12 and focus on other universities across the country who have abandoned their versions of the requirements in favor of a more holistic education.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

As of the 2010 census, more than 23,000 people live in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the deadline has passed to register for the March primary, the work is hardly over for Marsano, with the November 2020 election right around the corner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I anticipate that this upcoming presidential election will be busy. Of course, we will only have three and a half weeks to register students because they come back the last week of September and the deadline to register next year is October 19 and elections are November 3,” Marsano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She attributed UCSB’s high voter registration percentage to a greater push for in-person registration, opposed to online registration as most other universities do.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB’s notorious about preferring face-to-face voter registration rather than online,” Marsano explained. “You would get a card and if you didn’t do something with that card and mail it back, you would not be really registered. So the follow-up was more complicated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education is another important factor in the voting process that many of the organizations take on in addition to registration, according to Christian Ornelas, the Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Ornelas noted that the EVPLA office attempted to clear misinformation about voting after Rock the Vote SB’s national organization declared the local chapter illegitimate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After their first big efforts for registry during welcome week at campus dorms, Natalie Bastawros, vice president of Campus Democrats, said the VRVC went to great lengths to make sure everyone had the opportunity to register to vote in Santa Barbara County.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The goal of the club is to try to make it easier for people to register,” Bastawros said about the VRVC. She explained that if an individual registers online within Santa Barbara County, and they miss a box or two, the county sends you back an additional form in the mail for you to fill out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Democrats table Monday through Friday all of winter quarter for voter registration, according to Bastawros, and have also increased door-to-door canvassing in I.V. and at university housing. An app called PDI allows Campus Democrats to access public voter registration information, allows canvassers to target locations with low registration, according to Bastawros.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Organizations pushing for voter registration often face resistance from students who are already registered, but in a different county. A big part of tabling is educating students how local policies can have significant impact,” Bastawros said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It might not seem like that on the national level, but for the local elections here as students live, whether you live on campus or in I.V., it’s really, really important to register here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the Feb. 18 voter registration deadline, Campus Democrats tabled at ten different locations on campus up until the 6 p.m. deadline. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. is a “swing district” that determines the 3rd District County Supervisor vote, Bastawros said. While the other districts are fairly unwavering, the 3rd District, which encompasses I.V. and parts of northern and central Santa Barbara County, is often the deciding vote between the more rural 4th and 5th districts and the smaller but more populated 1st and 2nd districts that include Santa Barbara and Carpinteria.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-92550\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The rally garnered a crowd of approximately 40 lecturers and union members. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a statement released by the University Council-American Federation of Teachers (UC-AFT) on Feb. 1, “the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC has yet to make a serious proposal on any of [UC-AFT’s] key demands,” such as longer-term appointments and fair workload standards. The rally at UCSB was part of a UC-wide movement at each of the campuses in protest of the negotiations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rally garnered a crowd of approximately 40 lecturers and union members. Various lecturers from UCSB shared their experiences on teaching, along with their desires to see improvements in their contracts with the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are creating the next generation of leaders, but we do need now fair wages, fair working conditions and equitable treatment and respect,” Deborah Williams, a lecturer in the department of environmental studies, said to the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope we can make it very clear and we must make it very clear to our administration … what is in the best interest of the UC system and our students. And that is to treat us fairly and equitably.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the speeches, people gathered together to sing a song in demand of equitable treatment for lecturers. The statewide UC-AFT plans to splice together videos of the rally songs from every UC campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One speaker referenced the six strikes the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 held for contract negotiations, alongside protests against the university’s alleged illegal outsourcing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes it’s going to be tough, but AFSCME just had three years without a contract. They had six strikes over the period of that time and they ultimately beat the university back on contracting out,” the speaker said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rally continued with a march to the fifth floor of Cheadle Hall, where the protesters intended to voice their concerns and pass brightly colored cards containing student support and comments to David Marshall, the executive vice chancellor of the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the march reached the Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor — where Marshall was absent — the protesters passed along messages to office staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We make up well over half of the teaching power of this institution. If David Marshall and other people want us to succeed and want the UC to succeed, they need to pay us living wages,” one protester said in Cheadle Hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major point of contention among protestors revolves around the workload lecturers have. While tenure-track professors only have to teach four or five courses per year, lecturers have to pick up seven or eight courses a year at a lower pay, according to James Donelan, associate director of the Writing Program and a negotiator with UC-AFT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The higher workload forces lecturers to spend less time developing their courses and helping students, whereas tenure-track professors are able to conduct research with the extra time they have available, according to Aazam Feiz, a lecturer in Persian language and literature. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feiz talked about how she pushed to expand the teaching of the Persian language at UCSB since coming to the university in 2016 — a move that she said she did out of love for teaching, her students and the language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Creating these courses, doing these things, I have done it myself. So, if I am paid well and if I have a secure job, I can do these things more,” Feiz said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have family, we should think about our lives. So, people may think about finding another job, a place that they appreciate and work more,” Feiz explained. “I have 60 students here and I have one right at home too. I need to think about my child too.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Donelan, lecturers have no way to climb the ladder and get on the tenure path. In order to be hired on the tenure track, people have to compete in the university’s national search for a professor; a lecturer cannot be “promoted” to tenure track.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can get promoted within at any major corporation, but you can’t do it at a university. You can’t change that track,” Donelan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s part of how the university continues a tradition of excellence, picking the absolute best candidates from wherever, but it also eliminates any kind of possibility for lecturers to stop being anything other than lecturers.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

CSD. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) is including the Isla Vista Compost Collective (IVCC) under its payroll as a parent organization, but the IVCC will continue to fund itself independently from the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it lost its funding, IVCC has been unable to provide stipends to its 10 management and shift positions. Students have continued to work for IVCC on a volunteer basis this academic year, but IVCC has stalled compost collection to the 96 homes it currently serves and cannot expand to the 100 homes currently on its waitlist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization was created in Fall Quarter 2017 by current IVCC director and fourth-year environmental science major Jacob Bider, who conceived the idea of a grassroots-level composting group in I.V. when he moved out of on-campus housing after his freshman year and realized there was no composting in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider applied for an internship at the Santa Barbara chapter of the Surfrider Foundation and in his application proposed a student-led composting program to I.V. He and other Surfrider interns then began developing the composting initiative, which officially began in Winter Quarter 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents in I.V. can apply for composting buckets at their homes to be picked up weekly by IVCC dirtriders –– student workers for IVCC who pick up the bins each week, sort and deliver compost to gardens around I.V. and then bring the buckets back to people’s homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC started in Winter Quarter 2018 by serving approximately 10 homes and proceeded to double in size by the next quarter. A grant from the Coastal Fund in Spring Quarter 2018 allowed them to continue expanding, and by Fall Quarter 2019, IVCC was providing compost services to 96 homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC’s past three years of growth began stalling at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019 when Surfrider notified IVCC that shift workers like dirtriders were not allowed to be paid under a stipend and had to be paid by the hour instead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider said in an interview that the amount dirtriders receive on a stipend is equal to minimum wage, and that the decision to have stipends was proposed in its original funding with the Coastal Fund, but that they have now expanded beyond that model’s capacity. Surfrider told IVCC that they needed to switch their shift workers from stipends to payroll, but as a nonprofit, Surfrider didn’t have the capacity to do so. As a result, IVCC dissolved its relationship with Surfrider.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main problem the IVCC faced was its lack of a parent organization; the program didn’t need funding, Bider explained — it has a development team that works to apply for grant funding to help it expand operations. But in order to apply for any funding and put employees on a payroll system, it needed a larger organization to be a part of.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVCC then turned to the Office of Student Life (OSL) to absorb it but found it couldn’t put their shift workers on any payroll system. IVCC also reached out to Associated Students (A.S.) and the Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) but were told that “due to various policies, A.S. cannot take on the program,” Bider said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bider also spoke with Katie Maynard, event manager and coordinator of UCSB Sustainability, and was told that they were already spread too thin and could not take on the payroll for the IVCC; when IVCC tried reaching out to the Department of Environmental Studies, it was told that it’s “not in the nature” of an academic department to take on a project like the IVCC, Bider said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVCC then reached out to MarBorg Industries, a waste management company that collects residential and other compost. Currently, 20% of the compost collected by IVCC goes to MarBorg in order to prevent overflow of the three gardens that collect compost in I.V., according to Bider. MarBorg also told IVCC that it was unable to take on the group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But throughout the talks with various departments, Bider said there was a recurring name: the I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re seeking a partner that can provide us with institutional longevity and because [the I.V. CSD is] a governmental institution with paid staff and a board, you can provide us with that,” he said during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director George Thurlow suggested moving the conversation along to the next agenda item in the same vein: discussion regarding the possibility of composting bins at the Isla Vista Community Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jonathan Abboud, general manager for the I.V. CSD, MarBorg Industries offered to supply the community center with two free composting bins for six months. MarBorg stressed the importance of having the bins strictly managed; if the bins were open 24/7, people could toss in non-compostable items and render the compost useless, Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the option of having bins at the community center, the I.V. CSD began discussing ways for the IVCC to take part in providing a compost service in I.V. — something that combines the IVCC and the possibility of bins at the community center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Jay Freeman drafted a motion to direct staff to draft a memorandum of understanding between the IVCC and I.V. CSD for potential composting services for I.V., while authorizing the IVCC to approach organizations for possible sources of funding. The motion passed 7-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the IVCC has been stuck in a waiting period this academic year while searching for a new organization, students have continued their work on a volunteer basis. IVCC recently implemented a composting event service, where groups can apply on the IVCC website for composting at its events. IVCC also partnered with A.S. to hold a non-perishable food drive called Food on Wheels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As much as we want to communicate the struggles we’ve been through, we also want to communicate the fact that we’re still here and we’re really ready to get back into running and we have some things that we’re excited to promote too,” Ily Logeais, IVCC marketing and communications manager, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logeais said it was important for IVCC to find a group like the I.V.

The most recent trip took place over this past winter break and brought students to Texas, according to Alec Valdez, who serves as the alternative breaks co-coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdez, a fourth-year history of public policy major, said alternative breaks fit the model of Community Affairs Board (C.A.B.) as a whole: serving the local community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At some point [C.A.B.] came up with the idea of doing a program that went … out of the state of California. It’s a great program because it allows you to go outside of your comfort zone, outside of your culture zone,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B.’s free week-long volunteer trips are held during winter and spring break, and the group also holds a weekend trip during spring quarter. According to Valdez, Community Collaborations International (CCI), a private organization dedicated to setting up alternative break programs, helps C.A.B. set up the trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CCI offers different locations and programs, Valdez said, and his job as co-coordinator is to look through the programs and pick which one works best, alongside making efficient use of the funds available — a task that takes all quarter to plan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past winter break, the trip’s participants traveled to San Antonio, Texas, to help with the immigrant community there, Valdez said. He explained that this trip wasn’t “the first time we’re doing social justice work as opposed to just disaster relief,” noting that participants traveled to Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The destinations for each trip vary widely, ranging from Florida to Oregon, according to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/past-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.B. website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Students applying to be a part of a volunteer trip, however, are kept in the dark regarding the trip’s location — it isn’t until after they have been accepted that participants are told where the trip will be, Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The big thing is that curiosity because when we put out the applications, they don’t know where they’re going yet. We leave that until the very end when we pick our final team,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://cab.as.ucsb.edu/cab-alternative-break-trips/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative breaks website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, each program often gets an average of 200 applicants, but only 10 to 12 students are selected to go on the trip. Valdez emphasized the importance of selecting people who are willing and determined to volunteer, given how the trips are made possible by student fees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Valdez said that they are currently working on a smaller version of the alternative breaks: alternative weekends that would take students out of Santa Barbara into the wider California community to places such as San Francisco or Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This isn’t just a vacation trip we’re going on. We’re doing service,” Valdez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure that people who are going on this really value the opportunity and are putting in that effort to see that they really do want to be a part of the team and be a part of the project. We do value effort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Valdez, C.A.B.’s work can vary depending on wherever it is needed most. Both Valdez and Cassandra Zhou, a fourth-year psychology and brain sciences major, attended the 2019 spring break trip to Wilmington, North Carolina and helped families rebuild their homes after Hurricane Florence had passed through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were working at an animal shelter one day which had been overrun by abandoned and lost animals. They usually serve somewhere around 70 animals or 60 animals in that area. But then after the storm, they had like 150 animals on the property,” Valdez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Zhou, the service trip allowed her to expand on her own local volunteering and provide support to people outside of her area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get to do a lot of these things where you interact with different communities and you learn how to communicate with them and how to talk to them,” Zhou said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like volunteering gives you more of a purpose. I also typically don’t travel and alternative breaks with an amazing opportunity to travel for free, meet new people and contribute to a community that really needed help.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 9, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The agency saw a 57% rise in the number of clients visiting C.A.P.S. over the last five years,with a small decline in visits from the 2017-18 to 2018-19 school year, something that Olowude was able to attribute to a drop in available staff.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had some resignations and we have some folks who are out on leave. If we have less people … we see less people,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When there is fewer staff, the burden and stress then falls on other psychologists at C.A.P.S., who are forced to see more people and cut down individual session times in order to accommodate more students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another problem Olowude identified is the lack of diversity among staff, an issue he said he has been trying to tackle by hiring clinicians that can assist historically underserved populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the report, the biggest populations served at C.A.P.S. are White/Caucasian at 29.9%, Chicano/Mexican American at 25.2%, Chinese/Chinese American at 10.8% and Black/African American/African at 8.6%. In comparison to overall ethnicity statistics in the 2018-19 campus profile, White students make up 38% of the UCSB population, with Latinos/Chicanos at 28%, Asians/Pacific Islanders at 27% and Black/African American students at 5%.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92023\" style=\"width: 795px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92023\" data-attachment-id=\"92023\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/c-a-p-s-first-annual-report-shows-57-increase-in-total-visits-over-five-years/screenshot-25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"785,1007\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screenshot (25)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?fit=785%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-92023 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=785%2C1007\" alt=\"\" width=\"785\" height=\"1007\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?w=785&amp;ssl=1 785w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=195%2C250&amp;ssl=1 195w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-25.png?resize=768%2C985&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92023\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of C.A.P.S.</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olowude noticed that a large proportion of students who see C.A.P.S. come from underserved populations and has since been trying to accommodate students who may face a stigma from their families for seeking out mental health services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some people don’t feel comfortable explaining the therapy that they’re going to get with their families. Well, when they’re here, they don’t have to and it’s confidential,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address these students in particular, C.A.P.S. created the position of assistant director of Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion. The position, held by psychologist Meridith Merchant, is intended to help identify what can be done to make C.A.P.S. a more inclusive environment in order to connect with more populations of students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We decided to create a specific leadership position that would interact with various populations, various departments to help us understand how to best serve our students who come from very diverse backgrounds,” Olowude said. “The mental health initiative and inclusion is how can we be a more inclusive agency and what kind of initiatives we need as a department, a division and ultimately a campus to best serve our students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchant was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-28/c-a-p-s-only-black-female-psychologist-reflects-on-what-brought-her-to-ucsb/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1579158392170000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNYJwurUbZFIm6L3jAwYQsW-JguA\">recruited to work at UCSB in 2013</a> and cited the Black Student Union’s 2012 demands as a major reason for her decision to work at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Olowude believes the report can help C.A.P.S. predict and prepare accordingly for when counselors might be swamped by work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say, okay, so [these are] the six weeks of the quarter, what should I be expecting? Okay, we know we’re going to get inundated, so we need to make sure that no vacations are approved that week and we have everyone fully staffed and ready to go,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The annual report’s data shows when new staff should begin work in times of high service, along with revealing which student populations require more resources to properly help them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Olowude, the report will be available on the C.A.P.S. website within the next week. It will also be circulated among the student body and UCSB administration, along with organizations such as the Student Mental Health Task Force run by Associated Students President Alison Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very proud of the work that C.A.P.S. is doing. I’m very proud of the staff that we’ve been able to compile that work here. And I’m very humbled by and honored by the respect and the support our students have given us,” Olowude said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the January 16, 2018 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
