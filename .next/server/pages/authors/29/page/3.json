the second spot is up for grabs following Director Celine Washington’s decision to leave the board, announced by Lopez during the same meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the meeting, Bernard said she has confidence in Grange’s capability, especially with the projects he can bring to the board.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I see a lot of potential with Whit, with a lot of projects that include the community garden, including all different types of groups from the community,” Bernard said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange first learned about the opening through his work developing the </span><a href=\"http://www.islavistamethodist.com/edible-garden-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community garden</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the University United Methodist Church on the corner of Camino del Sur and Sueño Road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange said his previous work in I.V. has familiarized himself with the area and invested in him a significance for I.V. parks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of college students don’t really see I.V. as much of a community at all, but the parks are a space where people can come together and neighbors can meet each other,” Grange said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a new director, Grange said he wants to focus on local community-based projects. Grange said community gardens, local government and being a part of the community are what he enjoys.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange hopes to learn more about the process of achieving projects in the community and “seeing how that project culminates and how funding is pulled together and how staff works with board members, works with the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If someone has an idea for a project in their community or if someone has some sort of vision they want to accomplish, the process for something like that, start to finish, is really cool,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just how all these different things come together because there’s so many parts in play, it’s almost mind boggling.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grange plans to work on several projects, including the expansion of Estero Gardens and the development of the new community center set to open in August.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Grange hopes to see more students come out and interact with some of the more permanent residents in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most students view I.V. as a transitory place. Something you hear a lot with graduating people is like, ‘Oh yeah I’m over I.V.’ or whatever. People just have a certain idea over what the culture is in I.V. and don’t really try to explore beyond that,” Grange said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It would be cool to see people just meeting more of their neighbors and walking around with their headphones in less often.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

We can say, ‘This experience happened to me. I felt unsafe. Can you explain to me why it happened or can we talk about this to work it through?’” Meijer said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in April.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others who joined Meijer included leaders of community and campus groups including Students Against Sexual Assault, the Isla Vista Community Services District, the Black Students Union and Christian Ornelas, the EVPLA-elect for the 2019-2020 school year. Members of the EVPLA office were also present. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No law enforcement representatives attended this meeting. Meijer said it was due to the meeting’s preliminary nature in setting up a base and not conducting any official business yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preliminary draft of the agenda for meetings has introductions and guidelines for 10 minutes, public comment for 30 minutes, discussion for 30 minutes, identifying steps for 10 minutes and closed session without police officers for 10 minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer based the new Police Collaborative Board’s structure off of an original police collaborative board proposal left behind by 2015-2016 EVPLA Paola Dela Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those present at the meeting suggested edits to the list of potential members of the board, such as law enforcement officers, A.S. entities and property owners. Changes were also made to the sample agenda, along with the goals and structure of meetings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emphasizing restorative justice and community policing as goals for the board was among the recommended changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara initially had a “Student Safety Panel” headed by former Lieutenant Raymond Vuillemainroy of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), according to the original proposal from Dela Cruz. The purpose of the panel was to create a collaborative relationship with community members and student leaders through open dialogue, but it was dissolved in 2013 when Lt. Vuillemainroy left the IVFP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was substantial debate on whether the presence of police officers was necessary during public comment for future meetings. While safety was considered imperative for community members who cited personal experiences and grievances with police officers, Meijer found it equally important for police officers to be present to listen to safety concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees settled on a compromise: People will be able to speak at meetings or submit written anonymous comments on paper or through a Google Form. People can also choose to comment privately later in the meeting without the presence of police officers in a closed session.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A suggestion was made for the addition of a statement at the beginning of meetings stating police officers will not question people regarding their comments unless there is a present danger to others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertising and translating in other languages so that community members of different linguistic backgrounds can voice their concerns was proposed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Meijer is working to have the Police Collaborative Board added to A.S. Legal Code. The board would have to be voted and approved through A.S. Senate, according to Meijer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A finalized version of the proposal will be considered at the next collaborative board meeting on May 29.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer hopes to have the structure prepared so the board is ready to begin official business by Fall Quarter 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Schroeder, community resource deputy, believes the board will be able to foster a better relationship between the community and law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the board’s goal is to make an open line of communication… I think that’s a good thing.

She believes the pods are a great way to allow students to take recommended 20-minute naps and to advance the sleep initiative’s goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Health &amp; Wellness Program is also addressing sleep health through pop-up nap stations around campus, which allow students to take naps on inflatable beds, and the Gaucho Sleep Challenge, which gives students information about sleep each day and encourages monitoring sleep hours, according to O’Brien. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nap pods are not the first addition to the library for student rest; they follow the egg chairs that were installed in the library in December 2016, which are located on the first floor of Ocean Side in Davidson Library. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The egg chairs] provide a space for students to just take a 10-minute break and chill in the middle of their busy day.

The nap pods, while they’re very fancy-looking… are very specifically a place to sleep,” O’Brien said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope over time that students will start to really experience that the campus is supporting their needs, that students will more often be willing to take a nap if they need one in a safe environment and that it will help them with their academics.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

routes in Santa Barbara and Goleta to improve the timing and efficiency of routes. The line 28 adjustments were drafted by Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) and UC Santa Barbara and are scheduled to come into effect on Aug. 19.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding another bus to line 28 will allow buses to pass by every 10 minutes instead of the current 15-minute intervals, according to Hillary Blackerby, interim planning and marketing manager for SBMTD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Line 28 was established in August 2016 as part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UCSB’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>. The plan details campus development up to 2025 through changes in programs, transportation and housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB funds the operation of the shuttle. The quarterly lock-in student fee of $13.13 is based on enrollment in UCSB and allows students to ride the bus for free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby approached the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) at its April 23 meeting as part of SBMTD’s annual April outreach to inform the board of the proposed bus route changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackerby noted buses are often filled to capacity along El Colegio Road due to the high amount of students headed toward campus. Many of these students are what she describes as “line-neutral.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t care which [bus] you get on because you know whichever one you get on, it’s going to wind up at campus,” Blackerby said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When people are really just trying to get to campus, they’re filling up lines that have destinations past campus, like downtown.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buses headed toward campus are filled to capacity and exclude people farther down El Colegio as a consequence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 60-foot segmented buses with a standing load of 110 people were originally purchased for line 15x, but instead became used for line 28 due to higher demand.

id=\"caption-attachment-87716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The program was announced at the April 23 meeting of the I.V. CSD. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A designated sober party monitor is alerted through telephone if SBSO receives a noise complaint about the party. The monitor then has 20 minutes to shut down the party and lower noise levels, according to a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/sheriffs-office-announces-iv-party-registration-program/\">press release</a> sent out by SBSO on Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is intended to foster a partnership between residents and police, allowing party hosts to remedy noise complaints without the need for a police response.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy Justin Schroeder, community resource deputy for Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), announced the launch of the program at the April 23 meeting of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If a complaint is received, we then call or text that person and they have 20 minutes to mitigate that noise problem themselves without a police response. So our slogan for that is, ‘Get a text, not a ticket,’” said Schroeder at the I.V. CSD meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So we’re hoping people utilize that program, just to kind of foster a more community-oriented policing method out here in Isla Vista, and we hope it’s a popular program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Party Registration Program has been in Schroeder’s plans since his <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\">instatement</a> as Community Resource Deputy back in November 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think the students realize there’s like families and young kids that live in Isla Vista. We have some families that call every single night about a noise complaint,” Schroeder said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program builds on Schroeder’s goals of constructing a community-policing model and bridging the gap between law enforcement and community members. The program allows I.V. residents to monitor themselves, without the need for police intervention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar programs are also in effect in cities around the country. San Luis Obispo’s adoption of this program has been successful at California Polytechnic State University, according to the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must follow a <a href=\"https://www.sbsheriff.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IV-party-registration-guidlines2.pdf\">set of guidelines</a> in order to register a party with the program. Parties must be registered at least 48 hours in advance and can only be registered for Fridays and Saturdays, as well as Sunday if the following Monday is a holiday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police will be dispatched if contact cannot be made with the party monitor, and a citation will be issued if noise violations are verified. A citation will also be issued if a second complaint is received by SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Properties will also lose registration privileges for nine months if complaints are received for two separate parties within nine months of each other. Individuals who have received a noise violation citation or a social host ordinance violation cannot register for the program for nine months after the last violation occurred. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, people who have received a public nuisance party citation cannot register with the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lieutenant Juan Camarena of the IVFP also believes that the program will create a clearer line of communication between I.V. residents and law enforcement, along with establishing a safe environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This program embraces the idea of community-oriented policing and partners community members with law enforcement to solve the problem of noise complaints in Isla Vista,” Camarena said in the press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It also creates an open line of communication between the community and law enforcement, shows transparency and cooperation, and encourages future partnerships to solve other crimes.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

SASA recommends funding be directed toward establishing training as a paid position, so as to compensate volunteers for their time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One community member also proposed the money be used to create a community counseling center for drug addiction, homelessness and suicide intervention, along with a mental health assessment survey of Isla Vista, in which a survey would be sent out to gauge the mental health of I.V. residents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were also multiple complaints by people concerning the difficulty of negotiating with landlords, leading to discussion about a greater need for tenant resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public safety was a large concern among many in attendance. The need for better lighting, particularly in the farther reaches of I.V., was voiced by several attendees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Robert Geis believes a greater community voice is needed for change to happen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Let’s say, you know, there’s a member of our board that’s really interested in lighting and leading the charge to get better lighting out here and we’ve done the survey and stuff. But the one thing the community can do is be louder that the lighting is insufficient here,” Geis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve met with officials that say, ‘Ah, it’s been like that. We can’t do that.’ No. This is what the community wants, and I think we need to make that message clear.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency preparedness was another problem that was raised. Attention was then brought to the Thomas Fire and the lack of communication surrounding it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suggestions were made to keep Deltopia local and quiet, so as to not attract outsiders. One solution was raised to have a community festival, but attracting more out-of-towners was still a concern. Planning Deltopia into being a more controlled event is a primary goal for I.V. CSD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those unable to attend the public forum budget meeting, project proposals can also be </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTTQt6hc1sAxwWpX94fvHhte7EaAPTT1euio6enUPZqCfCeg/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submitted online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through a survey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A preliminary version of the budget will be released at the <a href=\"https://islavistacsd.ca.gov/files/9590f8912/4_23_2019+Regular+Meeting+Agenda-2.pdf\">next I.V.

Like all S.A.G. candidates in the past, he is not affiliated with any party and is running as an independent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Office of the Student Advocate (OSA) aids students accused of violating the University Code of Student Conduct and advocates for any changes to be made for a fairer policy. The OSA is a non-partisan executive branch within UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Student Advocate General] requires a lot of compassion. It requires approaching these student cases with a level of humanity and empathy in order to best understand and listen to the people that you’re actually serving,” Nguyen said during the S.A.G. forum on Monday, which began at 1:30 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this past year, Nguyen served as an off-campus senator with the 69th Senate. However, when asked about his past involvement with the OSA, he stated he had “zero experience” in the office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a job I’ve never done before. And so that’s why I really want to be, throughout this entire year, is [be] honest with my students, with my constituents,” he said during the forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how I’m going to do this job, but [based] off my experience as an off-campus senator this year, I can tell you at the very least, I’m excited.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he plans to increase awareness and improve the image of the OSA through two ways: social media and physical presence. He noted that being active on social media platforms to spread information and establishing a physical campus presence through tabling and door-to-door operations are key to making the OSA a trustworthy, compassionate and welcoming space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said he plans to continue a project left behind by Jack Tannenbaum, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-s-a-g-jack-tannenbaum/\">the 2017-2018 Student Advocate General.</a> Tannenbaum’s project focused on a poll that would be used to collect data at the end of elections on what students are most concerned about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen wants to improve upon the poll by sending it out in the middle of the year through G.O.L.D. and carrying out door-to-door operations in order to work on initiatives earlier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also emphasized his understanding of the boundaries between confidentiality and transparency, stating that confidentiality is needed when dealing with student cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easy for people to take an oath to be confidential, but I believe that those words and those oaths only take a real shape when someone understands the impact it has on the people around them. And that’s something I believe I’ve really internalized,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen said he prioritizes the safety of students. He added that the first step to combat threats of anti-Semitism and sexual harassment is to believe and listen to victims, and to work collaboratively with these groups in order to prioritize students’ safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope to be a beacon of inspiration for people to do more than what is at their most immediate inte</span>rest, their most convenient interest.”</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

CSD) Board of Directors to recognize the Chumash people’s historical and ongoing ties to I.V., also known as Anisq’oyo, through an acknowledgement at the beginning of all meetings.</p>\n<p>Anisq’oyo, part of the home of the Chumash people, encompasses the land that I.V. and UC Santa Barbara both reside on.</p>\n<p>I.V CSD staff members and Board President Spencer Brandt worked with Mia Lopez, a representative of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, to draft the acknowledgement and learn more about the heritage of the Chumash people.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just recognizing the past, but acknowledging those of the present and our future. We need to educate our community about the forgotten history that is our history,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>UCSB has also started using a similar land acknowledgement in graduation ceremonies and convocations for new students, according to Lopez. Multiple departments have begun to do the same at the beginning of their meetings as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s just incredibly important, I think, that we can serve as a model for something that local governments can do in whatever small way to try to do our part to rewrite history and not be silencing voices, both of the past and the present,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Annette Cordero, a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, explained how vital it is for governing bodies such as I.V. CSD to set an example for the rest of the community to remember the history of the people who occupied it for centuries.</p>\n<p>“It is healing for us. It does our hearts and our souls good to have this kind of recognition. On behalf of our, as we like to say for seven generations, our children and the children yet to come, this will have a meaning for them, so thank you,”  Cordero said.</p>\n<p>The resolution was adopted with a small amendment clarifying that the acknowledgement be recited at all meetings of the I.V. CSD, not just regular meetings. The resolution was passed with a 6-0 vote in favor and was met with a round of applause. Director George Thurlow was absent from the meeting.</p>\n<p>The full acknowledgement of the Chumash people and Anisq’oyo can be read below:</p>\n<p><i>“Before we begin, we would like to acknowledge the Chumash people, who are the traditional custodians of this land. We pay our respects to the Chumash elders, past, present, and future who call this place, Anisq’oyo, the land that Isla Vista sits upon, their home. We are proud to continue their tradition of coming together and growing as a community. We thank the Chumash community for their stewardship and support, and we look forward to strengthening our ties as we continue our relationship of mutual respect and understanding.”</i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-87413\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">More than 100 members came out to support AFSCME during the strike today. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“There’s a lot of ongoing investigations into these labor practices by the UC. They’ve been trying to wash their hands of them, and soon it’s going to catch up to them,” said Erick Ceballos, a third-year political science major and student intern for AFSCME. “They can’t let it go without a fight.”</p>\n<p>University Professional and Technical Employees (UPTE), a worker’s union for professional and technical UC employees, joined AFSCME in protesting against the UC. UPTE represents more than 13,000 employees, while AFSCME Local 3299 represents more than 24,000 employees across the UC campuses.</p>\n<p>According to Jarrod Coldron, a former UCSB student, present-day groundskeeper and Member Action Team (M.A.T.) leader for AFSCME, UC allegedly employed intimidation tactics against workers at the most recent solidarity strike with UPTE.</p>\n<p>“For example, we had some bosses that were threatening retaliation against workers who went on strikes. Unfortunately, we actually had some violence on the strike lines at Berkeley and Davis campuses, and as far as I know, that hasn’t been denounced by the UC yet,” Coldron said.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://theaggie.org/2019/01/11/video-shows-alleged-uc-davis-employee-attack-afscme-3299-strikers-in-october/\">altercation</a> between a UC Davis managerial worker and strikers arose when a truck drove close to the picket lines during the three-day strike last fall. A UC Berkeley employee was also tackled to the ground and <a href=\"http://www.dailycal.org/2018/02/01/uc-berkeley-worker-detained-ucpd-uc-worker-rally/\">arrested</a> in a protest in February of last year.</p>\n<p>“We’re just out here to affirm that we have a right to speak and that even if we’re being intimidated, we’re going to make sure that our voices are heard.”</p>\n<p>More than 100 members came out to support AFSCME during the strike today, according to Serafin Zamora, UCSB groundskeeper and executive board member for AFSCME.</p>\n<p>Strikers rallied and marched from Storke Tower to Henley Gate, chanting phrases such as “Whose UC? Our UC!” and held signs that said “Standing Together for a Better UC” and “Where’s Yang?”</p>\n<p>Michael Kile, a fourth-year chemistry major at UCSB, explained that flyers with a FAQ were used to intimidate workers before the May strike. The flyers, sent out by UC, contained questions such as, “Can I be fired for striking?” answered by, “Yes, if it is not a legal strike.”</p>\n<p>“There’s more that they can do to support workers, and they’re not doing it. Instead, they’re being silent and it’s really saddening and frustrating as a student to see this,” said Ana Fabian, a fourth-year student intern for AFSCME.</p>\n<p>“We come to an institution trying to learn more about these issues, but they’re happening right here right now.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

They recounted how excited some students were about the visibility of the trans flags at the fair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[That excitement] was really affirming for us, as the RCSGD, who has been working really diligently and providing trans visibility on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center is also hosting several workshops throughout the week on interpersonal violence and sexual violence. Students will be able to attend discussions in a safe space to talk about their identities and personal experiences, along with issues facing their communities, Solis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RCSGD will be offering resources and paperwork for students who wish to legally change their name and/or gender on Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The week will be ending with the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth annual Transgender Day of Visibility Celebration, sponsored by the Santa Barbara Transgender Advocacy Network</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aryn Amezcua, a third-year UCSB student and Trans Task Force Advocacy Coordinator for the RCSGD, said the week has had a great impact on the community so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people who come through, they thank us. They’re like, ‘We really like this, we needed this,’” Amezcua said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center also partnered with Richie’s Barber Shop in Isla Vista for a Beat and Barber event, where the shop provided free, gender-affirming haircuts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m familiar with the movement and I support it and I wanted to show my support. Everyone’s been really happy about it,” said Richie Ramirez, owner of Richie’s Barber Shop.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other businesses such as gc2b also worked with RCSGD to show support for the community. Gc2b, a trans-owned company dedicated to providing safe binding options for trans masculine people, donated eight chest binders to be given out as raffle prizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The RCSGD managed to organize a large week of events due to the dedication of passionate people [students and staff] who wanted to create a vibrant and welcoming campus for the trans community,” Solis said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope this week creates momentum for other UCSB programs, departments, and student organizations to ask within their own spaces if trans students, faculty, and staff are represented and have a voice.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB as a whole has been working on fostering more support for transgender students, according to Solis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) recently introduced a new support group dedicated to trans and non-binary issues and experiences. The group, called TRANSformative, allows members to discuss issues related to transitioning, misgendering, bodies, relationships, medical care, transphobia and general life topics, according to the C.A.P.S. website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solis finds that UCSB has taken strides to create resources tailored to the trangender community but continually hears from students that more all-inclusive restrooms, medical access and curriculum are needed to support the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think more access to healthcare would be great, especially for trans students it can be very expensive. We don’t have the insurance and that’s already a huge setback,” Amezcua said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amezcua believes more pronoun awareness and training is needed for professors and teaching assistants in classroom settings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully, we can expand [Trans Week] into a month next year with more planning and more collaborations. It’s just going to get bigger and better from here,” Solis said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

The center would provide legal assistance for survivors of sexual assault and would receive support from A.S. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Community Services District finalized an agreement during its Jan. 8 meeting to open a survivor resource center in Isla Vista in collaboration with Standing Together Against Sexual Assault, a organization addressing sexual assault in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) President Emily Montalvo-Telford said the new center would make it easier for survivors to meet with a Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) representative and receive immediate counseling. The center will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>\n<p>The center will provide a place in I.V. where survivors can receive medical attention, make a police report and obtain an emergency protective order. Previously, survivors would only have access to these services at STESA’s location in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Survivors will also be able to obtain emergency services such as food, shelter and transportation. The center will also have the resources to help survivors apply for U Visas and T Visas, Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>U visas are non-immigrant visas designed to aid victims of crime who have suffered physical or mental abuse in the U.S. and are assisting the investigation of the crime. T visas provide the same service to those who have suffered from human trafficking.</p>\n<p>The idea for a Survivor Resource Center in I.V. began with <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">Ro’Shawndra Earvin’s 2017 Demands</a>, a list of 12 demands presented to Chancellor Yang after a 13 hour sit-in.</p>\n<p>Earvin, a former student at UCSB and advocate for sexual assault reforms, along with a large group of students, presented a list of 12 demands calling for sexual assault reform. The No. 1 demand on the list called for the creation of a survivor resource center.</p>\n<p>STESA, along with SASA and the I.V. CSD board members, have been collaborating over the past year in order to make the center a reality.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V. CSD, said work on the project first began in Spring 2018 when he was approached by Montalvo and Madeline Loudon, I.V. Community Coordinator for SASA. They presented to Brandt the lack of services for survivors of sexual assault provided by UCSB and said that the resource center would be a quick solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>“We want to be a voice for survivors when there are injustices in the system,” Brandt said. “So this, in particular, is an example of a supporting service.”</p>\n<p>Funding for the center primarily comes from the Measure R tax that was passed last year, granting the CSD a source of revenue for their projects.</p>\n<p>The survivor resource center will be located in a central location in I.V. and will be easily accessible for residents of the community, Montalvo said. To access the center, a survivor would need to call STESA’s hotline at (805) 564-3696, where they will be directed by an advocate to the center for aid.</p>\n<p>“During our budgeting process this year, it was a big priority for the budget committee to make a line item specifically for renovating this space so that it could become the survivor resource center,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Montalvo and Brandt both mentioned how rewarding it was to work with the various groups dedicated to resolving the issue of sexual assault in I.V. and UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, this project was one of the smoothest that I’ve ever seen, especially when it comes to projects where I’ve worked with student groups on it, and that is really a testament to SASA and everything they’ve done. The same would go for STESA,” said Brandt.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Arturo Martinez is a reporter at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-73799\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The program works with Isla Vista Elementary to help with language barriers.<em> Nexus file photo </em></p></div>\n<p>The Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) established the program, called Interpreting In Our Local Schools, during the 2016-2017 school year to assist local elementary school districts. The program draws on UCSB students to work as paid translators for parent-teacher conferences in schools where a language barrier exists between the student’s family and the teacher.</p>\n<p>Susan Derwin, director of the IHC, said the program was created as a way for graduate and undergraduate students to refine their language skills and practice them within a community setting.</p>\n<p>“Our aim was to draw upon tools associated with the humanities to deepen students’ engagement with local communities while also strengthening relationships between the university as an institution, local schools, and UCSB students, faculty, and staff,” Derwin said in an email.</p>\n<p>The program has two main goals: facilitating the involvement of parents with the education of their children and providing UCSB students as role models for children pursuing higher education later in life, Derwin said.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Elementary and Franklin Elementary are the schools currently part of the parent-teacher interpreter program.</p>\n<p>Interpreters have also been provided for the Individualized Education Program in three different school districts: Santa Barbara Unified School District, Goleta Union School District and Hope School District.</p>\n<p>The Humanities and Fine Arts Instructional Improvement Grant, which supports the improvement of language instruction for UCSB students, and the Goleta Union School District fund the program.</p>\n<p>Derwin says the program initially faced problems getting the word out to possible interpreters for the program and bringing in people who were interested.</p>\n<p>Much of the support for the program came when Professors Aline Ferreira and Viola Miglo of the Spanish and Portuguese Departments became interested in the program and recruited the help of their language students.</p>\n<p>Ferreira holds the training sessions, according to Derwin.</p>\n<p>The program had 21 interpreters working for the Fall 2018 conferences and Derwin expects that number to rise to about 35 for the Spring 2019 Conferences.</p>\n<p>Student translators are taught key vocabulary needed to navigate the parent-teacher conferences, as well as how to handle issues of confidentiality and family-based issues.</p>\n<p>“They see that the skills they take for granted – their own bilingualism – is an important resource for the future, as they consider careers paths that might draw upon the outstanding language skills they possess,” Derwin said.</p>\n<p>Derwin says the program has largely been a success with schools. Feedback from the translators and teachers has shown a high level of satisfaction with the program.</p>\n<p>Casie Kilgore, principal of Franklin Elementary, said the translators were a highlight of fall semester and were constantly talked about.</p>\n<p>“My translator was great,” wrote one teacher at Franklin Elementary. “She told me after that she saw herself in the little girl during the conference and was so touched to help a family understand the importance of education at an early age. After she left, I realized, what a great example she is to the family and the student of a current college student pursuing her education.”</p>\n<p>The program is receiving more and more requests for interpreters and Derwin believes that it is an indicator of the program’s quality and success.</p>\n<p>“Many of our interpreters who are heritage speakers have shared with us that when they were in elementary school, they often had to serve as interpreters for their own parents, and this was very challenging.  Now they are in a position to help students who are in a similar position.”</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 9 print edition of the</i> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Arturo Martinez is a reporter at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p>\n<p><i>Correction [Jan. 10, 12:13 p.m.]: The IHC is the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center, not the Interpersonal Humanities </i><i>Center, as stated in a previous version of this article.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

I really enjoyed that model, and I thought how could we get even better at this and understand the needs of the community better and model our policing to the needs of the community,” he said in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>In the past year since Schroeder has been stationed at IVFP, he said he has experienced the ins and outs of I.V.’s unique community and its functioning.</p>\n<p>“I really saw the interaction between our department, law enforcement and the community members out in Isla Vista and saw how the way we interact really impacts how we enforce the law,” he said.</p>\n<p>One project he wants to bring to I.V. is the Citizen’s Academy, which is a two- to eight-week program about law enforcement that gives insight behind what police do and why.</p>\n<p>“A lot of stuff we do, the citizens don’t know why we do it. It’s tactically sound for us, it’s the way we’ve been trained, but the community doesn’t understand it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Schroeder said his goal is to identify needs in the community by bringing programs. He is already working with I.V. Tenants Union, I.V. Youth Projects and UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students to identify areas that require change.</p>\n<p>Schroeder already started several programs since his appointment as CRD less than a month ago, some of which are pilot programs meant to gauge the response of the community.</p>\n<p>One such project is the party registration program, which allows residents of I.V. to notify law enforcement when they are hosting large parties. Deputies will then send a text to the hosts to alert them if they have received any noise complaints.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have anything like that. All we get is a large party and now we have to try to find a resident and we shut the party down because we can’t find anyone who lives there,” Schroeder said.</p>\n<p>“If we were to send a simple text message, maybe the party would quiet down a little bit.”</p>\n<p>He also wants to implement a diversion program for citations in I.V. Through this program, people who have received tickets for a noise or alcohol violation can attend an educational program and do community service as an alternative to paying fines.</p>\n<p>Schroeder said it would be more beneficial to educate the public rather than punish them and students who cannot afford to pay a hefty fine.</p>\n<p>He also brought up a program designed to educate people on how to react and respond to an active shooter situation. The current program in place is located in Goleta but is also in the works in I.V.</p>\n<p>Schroeder works closely with UC Police Department as well in his position. He is currently working alongside Matt Bowman, community and relations training lieutenant, and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\">Kovena Avila</a>, I.V.’s new interpersonal violence detective.</p>\n<p>This collaborative effort brings forth several programs, such as town hall meetings for fraternities and sororities.</p>\n<p>Schroeder emphasized the importance of town hall meetings, as they cover a wide range of topics in I.V. from sexual assault, how to act if pulled over by police or what to do if an individual is caught with an open container.</p>\n<p>Schroeder urges residents of I.V. to contact him with any issues they might have.</p>\n<p>“Bring me what’s bothering you because I don’t know what’s bothering people out there. Sometimes people are a little shy or reserved about telling me. They’ll go to a party or they’ll go home and complain about it to their friends, but we never receive that complaint,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I just want to open up that line of communication and really bring any issues at all to me, and I’ll do my best to address it.”</p>\n<p>Deputy Schroeder can be found at the foot patrol station, located on 6504 Trigo Road in I.V.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

A student must first provide documentation that all other options have been exhausted in order to qualify.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vouchers are meant to assist students that are suffering through a one-time housing emergency that could force them to relocate, jeopardizing their education at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Miller, five students have been assisted by the program already and that number is expected to rise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program is a joint partnership between Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Services, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and the Financial Crisis Response Team, according to Mike Miller, assistant vice chancellor for Enrollment Services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding comes from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program works to estimate and assess the needs of students. It also serves to identify students who might be experiencing more systematic financial difficulties so as to direct them to resources that can provide them assistance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is an effort to help address the growing basic need requests we have been seeing here on our campus, which unfortunately is a national trend due to the increasing cost of higher education,” Miller said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A process will be in place to notify landlords that a student is working with the housing voucher program, said Miller. Communication between landlords and the program is key to buying the student time to receive funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hopeful our relationships in those areas will be fruitful in buying us the time needed to sort through these issues which can sometimes be complicated,” Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources from UCHS will be utilized in the program, such as UCHS mediators that are in place to settle disputes between tenants and landlords.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each case is carefully addressed and verified through the Financial Crisis Response Team to prevent misuse of the vouchers, Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vouchers are also either directed into the student’s BARC account or addressed as checks to their landlord, Muñoz said. No cases of misuse have been reported yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The housing voucher program is the first step in creating a safety net program for students struggling financially, Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we make programs like this, I want to make sure they’re sustainable long-term, so we’re not just offering a service for a couple of years, then seeing it go away,” Miller said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really need to see what kind of volume we’re going to see and go from there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students can submit an application to the Financial Crisis Response Team by emailing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financialcrisis@sa.ucsb.edu</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 15 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

#NotWorthIt campaign warns of fines, DUI checkpoints and increased police presence during Halloween.</p>\n<p>The advertisements are targeted toward “non-locals who have no affiliation with UC Santa Barbara,” according to UCSB Director of News and Media Relations Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UCSB warns the public about the potential consequences of I.V. Halloween celebrations by publicizing testimonials from regretful Halloween party attendees of the past on various social media platforms, as seen in past and current advertisements.</p>\n<p>The funding for ads decreased from 2017 to 2018, according to Estrada.</p>\n<p>Halloween in 2016 and 2017 saw a significant decrease in police presence. This is part of a noticeable downward trend in the number of police in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Halloweens in 2013 and 2014 saw heavy reports of damage and arrests in I.V. as previously reported on by the Nexus.</p>\n<p>Multiple deputies will be deployed on foot this weekend to the busier streets including Del Playa Drive, Trigo Road and Sabado Tarde, according to Sergeant Daniel Calderon from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP).</p>\n<p>In anticipation of large crowds, both IVFP and University of California Police Department (UCPD) have increased their available staff, according to Sgt. Calderon.</p>\n<p>The safety of the UCSB’s campus was also a concern this past weekend as a result of Delirium and the soccer game against California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“We’re responsible for the security and safety of the campus, regardless of what’s going on. We are responsive to the crowds and the demeanor and the total activity that is going on,” IVFP Lieutenant Dave Millard said.</p>\n<p>Metal detectors were present at Delirium as part of the security screening at the request of the Thunderdome department.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) reported six citations for minor in possession, four for open container and two for loud music, according to a SBSO representative who attended the I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Police issued other citations for public urination, violation of the outdoor festival ordinance and unlicensed driving. Three people were arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>A total of 27 citations and eight arrests were made on Friday and Saturday, according to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson. This number includes citations and arrests made by both SBSO and the UCPD.</p>\n<p>UCPD made five arrests on campus and issued three citations. One person was medically transported for alcohol intoxication on Friday.</p>\n<p>UCPD primarily patrolled campus property and the business district and SBSO patrolled the rest of I.V. during this past weekend, according to Hoover.</p>\n<p>The numbers are similar to last year, when only 25 citations and arrests were made during Halloween weekend by both departments.</p>\n<p>The post-Halloween weekend is expected to be quiet as well. The festival ordinance, preventing loud music or noise, is in effect until Nov. 4. Parking restrictions end on Halloween.</p>\n<p>“That is lower than some typical Friday or Saturday nights in Isla Vista,” Hoover said in an email. “Thanks to everyone for making this a safe and uneventful weekend.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
