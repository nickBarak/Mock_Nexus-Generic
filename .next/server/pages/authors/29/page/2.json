Yang on Jan. 7.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As UC Santa Barbara’s fourth Chancellor, she provided steady and able leadership at a time of both economic challenges and rapid growth,” Yang said in the memo. “She emphasized diversity and academic excellence, and is credited with the development of the campus’s first 15-year Long Range Development Plan.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus flag was lowered to half-staff on Jan. 8 to honor her memory, Yang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uehling was the first female chancellor in the entire UC system. Steven Elzer ‘88, who was the news editor of the Daily Nexus when Uehling was inaugurated, recounted the excitement that came along with her inauguration, but also the turmoil that encompassed the campus at that time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were very excited about [the first female chancellor]. She was an extraordinary leader,” Elzer said. “There was a lot of politics on the campus at that time. There were a lot of different factions that were divisive. It was a very raucous time in the history of the campus for sure. And she did everything she could to try to unify the deep divides that were rumbling over campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a previous Nexus article from 1986, Uehling’s predecessor — Chancellor Robert Huttenback — resigned following misuse of state funds to improve his home, including a hefty $104,000 renovation to his kitchen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Laurence Iannaccone, the chair of the Academic Senate in 1994, she was instrumental in the construction of many buildings on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She came to a campus that was building poor and program rich. A significant building program has been one of her major contributions to UCSB,” Iannaccone wrote when Uehling announced her retirement, according to the memo sent out by Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While we are still short of adequate space, Chancellor Uehling will leave behind a solid plan for our long-term physical development — a plan that will carry the campus into the 21st Century. Another noteworthy mark of the Uehling era here at UCSB is the expansion of the School of Engineering.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uehling also managed to restore trust in the Office of the Chancellor, following a tumultuous time of corruption during Huttenback’s term, Elzer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She put a lot of herself and a lot of effort into rebuilding the campus’ image and the stolen integrity in the Office of the Chancellor in a time that needed that,” Elzer added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She had the best interest of the campus at heart and understood her unique role at the time in the history of the campus and then doing everything she could to do it right.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Jan. 10, 2:13 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote to Chancellor Henry T.

However, the funding for the center’s physical space comes from UCSB’s Department of Geography, according to Gary Lawrence, director for University Center and Events Center administration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lawrence said he was first contacted about the vacant space by Melissa Fontaine, the geography department’s food security coordinator, on July 3, Maynard and Mike Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services and member of the Food Security and Basic Needs Task Force.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Their goal] fit with the AS Food Bank and their mission to address the food security issues of UCSB students,” Lawrence said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lease agreement was signed on Sept. 23 and extends through June 20, 2020; the Department of Department agreed to pay $3 per square foot, for a total of $1230 per month for 410 square feet.

CSD) reached out to Lucidity about a festival designed to steer people away from Del Playa Drive and increase safety precautions during Deltopia, Lucidity presented its plan to the I.V. CSD board in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/i-v-csd-considers-turning-deltopia-into-a-sanctioned-festival/\">early October</a>. Since then, the I.V. CSD has been engaged in negotiations with various community stakeholders — law enforcement, UC Santa Barbara, County Public Works and Lucidity — to determine the feasibility and necessity of the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late October, Lucidity cut the budget for the proposal </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/lucidity-festival-budget-reduced-by-20000-following-district-concerns/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by $20,000</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, following district concerns that the price tag for the festival would be too much for the district to shoulder alone. Lucidity also hosted a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/lucidity-fields-community-questions-about-alternative-deltopia-festival-during-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in early November to answer questions and clear misconceptions regarding the festival, emphasizing that its purpose is to channel crowds away from Del Playa Drive into a safer space, not to replace Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In mid-November, the I.V. CSD delayed its decision on the proposal to December after noting a number of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/i-v-csd-vote-for-lucidity-festival-on-deltopia-postponed-to-december/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“outstanding issues”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the contract, particularly with the police presence needed at the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just don’t think that on the current timeline we’ll be able to accomplish our goals and so it’s one of those things where we should not pull the trigger if we’re not 100% sped-up and ready,” Board President Spencer Brandt said during Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel that the best way to move forward is to set a target date for 2021 and to move forward with [the] group of stakeholders,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sara Marvel, a director for Lucidity, stressed the timeliness of the plan’s approval when it was first proposed in October, so that preparations could be made in time for the spring. She had hoped for a contract’s approval in a week’s time, but negotiations with various parties stretched to more than a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the delay, however, “Lucidity is at the point where they’re willing to step back and withdraw their proposal for this year and try to work with us to try and find where best they can be plugged in,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that although plans for the spring festival were pushed back to 2021, the I.V. CSD intends to work with UCSB to host an alternative event in I.V., such as the university’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/police-ucsb-administration-local-government-prepare-for-deltopia/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SunFest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — a festival held in Storke Plaza as an alternative to Deltopia for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Abboud, general manager for the I.V. CSD, said he is in contact with Katya Armistead, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">assistant vice chancellor for student affairs and dean of student life, to potentially open SunFest to I.V. residents who don’t attend UCSB, but the I.V. CSD still needs to meet with both UCSB and Lucidity to see where the two entities stand on the idea, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity will still be in the picture and the I.V. CSD has “spoken with them about the possible use of the Guardians,” a security team focused on harm reduction, for a possible “alternative event in Isla Vista this year,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the original proposal to the I.V. CSD, the </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardianteam.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guardians</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played a key role in emphasizing the need for safety precautions for Deltopia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Craig Bonner, chief deputy for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, the office is “absolutely dedicated” to turning Deltopia into a safer event and is willing to help put safety measures in place for this upcoming Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anything we can do to help mitigate the unsanctioned aspects of Deltopia is a good thing and obviously if we can get people into a controlled environment where they are safe, that is an excellent thing,” Bonner said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The negotiations for the spring festival opened a much larger conversation on the safety issues seen at large events in I.V. and the I.V. CSD’s ability in tackling them, Brandt said at Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While these are fun events for many of our residents, there are many of our residents that are made to be victims by crime, by sexual assault during these large events and there is an abnormally high number of people who are hospitalized as a result of alcohol and drugs during these events,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deltopia 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> saw a spike in attendees, citations and arrests, but a decrease in medical transports; the majority of arrests were for disorderly conduct due to alcohol.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Deltopia is] one of the biggest public safety issues in our community and it’s also something that is absolutely revered by so many of the people who live here. It’s a tricky line to walk, but we have to be resolute in bringing these issues forward,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Dec. 14, 12:53 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that Lucidity first proposed the plan to the I.V.

among the UC system, most of the centers are between 20 and 30 years old,” current RCSGD director Craig Leets, who is the center’s ninth director, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were many students, staff and volunteers and other students who all have made the center of what it is today, who have brought the center through 20 years,” Leets added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s always important to me, to honor and recognize like the people who came before us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center kicked off its 20th anniversary celebrations with an event on Tuesday evening, with Leets giving attendees a small history of the RCSGD. He started by describing how the center, then known as the Queer Resource Center, was first started by a group of student activists in 1999 after the death of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming who was murdered in 1998.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The students] organized to convince Chancellor Yang, who was here then and is still here now, that we needed a specific resource center for LGBTQ students. At the time that MCC existed, as well as the Women’s Center. But there was no university-funded space for LGBTQ students,” Leets explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The staff members then began a video call with former students, staff and activists who had worked with the center in the past, all of whom </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reflected on the activism involved with the RCSGD to celebrate it.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sabrina Kwist, dean of equity and inclusion at Los Medanos College, who was a key part of the activism behind the founding of the RCSGD, was on the call and spoke to attendees about the experience of creating the center.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kyle Richards, the director of the RCSGD from 2002 to 2007, the center was originally located on the third floor of the University Center (UCen), next to University and Community Housing Services — Leets said that this was why the kickoff was held in the UCen as opposed to the center’s current location on the third floor of the Student Resource Building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The center was on] the third floor next to the community housing office and it was a small lounge and an office with a desk and a little library and then some sofas and that was about it,” Richards said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was during my time here that we moved over … That was when the Student Resource Building was first built and we were one of the first tenants that moved into it when it was opened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also during Richards’ time as director that the center changed its name from the Queer Resource Center to the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity, citing concerns that “queer” was inapplicable to people who did not identify as such.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was a concern that the word ‘queer’ may be off-putting to some people, or they may be scared or didn’t identify as queer. So we wanted a name that was more inclusive to people, that felt like a broader terminology that was more representative of the greater community,” Richards explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He joked that despite the center’s name change, “RCSGD” wasn’t quite the nice, quick acronym they had hoped for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Richards, during the center’s early days it only had a very small budget to work with, so the center would partner with other campus organizations such as the MultiCultural Center and the Women’s Center to bring in speakers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it was a queer-related theme, then we would co-sponsor it with them and add it to a programming calendar of events that we would distribute. We would cross list things; that’s how we kind of maximized what we did, by partnering with other campus offices. That was the main way,” Richards said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the kickoff isn’t all the center has planned for the 20th anniversary. During Winter Quarter, the center will have 20th anniversary keynote speakers — to be announced in the coming weeks </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— for its trans revolution series, Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also added that the center plans to invite alumni back to its annual drag brunch and will finish up the year by inviting alumni and past center staff for a dinner that will “recognize the history of the center.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the kickoff event, Leets announced the launch of a photo installation project for the outside of the director’s office at the RCSGD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you post [photos] on social media and use any one of these four hashtags, we will use those at the end of the year to create a permanent photo installation that will live on in the center, similar to the mural that was created for the 15th anniversary,” Leets said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leets added that he hopes to expand on the services offered by the center — referencing the recent initiative by the center to implement pronouns across several university systems — and to continue making the campus a more inclusive place for LGBTQ+ people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a vibrant community within our lounge here in the Student Resource Building — [we’re] trying continually to make UCSB be a welcoming place for all LGBTQ+ people.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

CSD), because it is a public entity to provide officers for any large event, regardless of any separate private security hired for the event, according to Brandt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but the district would like to minimize the police presence at the festival, he said, as simply seeing officers in uniform could be potentially unsettling for people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The truth is that cracking down and forcing and arresting and ticketing our way of public safety is not possible,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That just drives a wedge between law enforcement and the community and we can’t go down that road again. We saw what happened in 2014, there was a riot and we can’t go back to that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Jay Freeman called the proposed contract with SBSO — which he said could potentially raise costs for the district </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “an endless pit of liabilities.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contract includes an “indemnification” clause, which would require the I.V. CSD to agree to “indemnify, defend and hold harmless [the] COUNTY … against any and all claims, actions, losses, damages, and/or liabilities,” according to the contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman raised concerns that should a situation arise in which the SBSO would need to bring in more officers, costs would rise for the I.V. CSD. However, according to G. Ross Trindle, district counsel for the I.V. CSD, the possibility is very low for a situation in which the I.V. CSD would be at fault for the actions of SBSO.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director George Thurlow also mentioned concerns from SBSO leadership about the timeline of putting together the festival. At the I.V. Safe Task Force meeting held earlier that day, he said SBSO leadership did not believe that holding the festival this year “is the right path to take.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[SBSO’s] position on this is ‘wait until next year. It’s too soon and there’s plenty of time for us to get on the same page,’” Thurlow said at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contract negotiations have been ongoing for over </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/i-v-csd-considers-turning-deltopia-into-a-sanctioned-festival/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a month</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now; the proposal was originally brought to the I.V. CSD in early October. Sara Marvel, director for Lucidity LLC, emphasized a month ago the importance of approving the contract in a week to get all the moving pieces ready in time for spring.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Half of the board seemed to be seriously considering the possibility of pushing the festival until 2021, although Brandt was adamant that appropriate adjustments could be made to the contract in time for it to be passed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman stressed the timeliness of the contract as well, adding that pushing the festival to the following year would give the board more time to finalize contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A month ago we had a meeting and we were talking about these contracts and how we’re going to handle it. It was, essentially, if you don’t get the contract done right now, we won’t have enough time and that was a month [ago] and we still don’t have the contract done, it’s not going to happen until weeks from now,” Freeman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just don’t think we’re able to pull this off right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Janet, a resident of I.V. for eight years who attended Tuesday’s meeting, echoed Freeman’s thoughts, stating that she believed that changing the culture around Deltopia could not be done in a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So as far as the goals go, which is to change the atmosphere of Deltopia, it has to be a multi-year project. It’s not going to happen in one year. You have to think out a little bit farther because it will be a gradual process,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

A student can submit reports of sexual misconduct — anonymously or not — either online, over the phone, via email or in person; the office will then establish a case file and reach out to the student in order to explain how they can move forward with the case, Alvarez explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that can only happen if the complainant responds to the office’s follow up, she emphasized, explaining that if students submit through an anonymous report and provide scarce information, it can severely limit the office’s ability to continue a case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes we just have a first name. Sometimes we just have very general information about what happened,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it seems that we have insufficient information, meaning not enough information to move forward with one of those response options, then we may proceed with closure. That doesn’t mean we can’t reopen [the case] when we receive new information in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alia Reynolds, president of Students Against Sexual Assault, emphasized to the panel and attendees that communication between the university and students needs to be open at all times “without students having to ask for that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think students need access and communication of this information continuously and constantly, versus sending out updates on everything that’s been done after the fact,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students pressed the panel for answers on what the university is going to do moving forward regarding the allegations against Sigma Pi.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have answered [with] appropriate actions to take once the investigation is complete,” one student said. “With all due respect, I believe you still haven’t answered the question about what actions are being taken now against these fraternities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miles Ashlock, acting associate dean and Office of Student Life (OSL) director, said that as soon as the OSL members heard of multiple allegations against fraternities in I.V., they held a meeting with the Interfraternity Council (IFC) to have a “long and very open dialogue about our very explicit concerns about the reports that we had received.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You have answered [with] appropriate actions to take once the investigation is complete… With all due respect, I believe you still haven’t answered the question about what actions are being taken now against these fraternities.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The IFC council made a decision immediately in that room… to create a self-imposed moratorium on social events. They originally imposed that for four days, and after that period they reassessed and decided to institute it indefinitely while ongoing discussion and internal rulemaking and conversations with the university administrators and advisors continued,” Ashlock said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn added that the IFC’s ban on parties was just one step in creating a safer environment for students, but another student pointed out that the moratorium would only cut off the liquor and leave the root cause ignored.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We’re] saying we don’t want to have parties in these houses where people are going to be unsafe,” Klawunn said. “We believed that not having social events in those houses until we could put some safe steps into place was the right direction, and so that’s where we stand.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students voiced similar concerns about the university’s Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) initiative, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sexual assault defense training program offered through the UC Police Department</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One student emphasized that getting to the underlying cause of the sexual assaults should be the university’s primary focus, rather than creating defense programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems that the R.A.D. training is the only tangible outcome of what we’ve heard going on  campus, and it seems as though [it’s saying] ‘Let’s train women to defend themselves’ instead of ‘Let’s get to the root of the problem,’” the student said. “There’s a culture, there’s a problem with these criminals out there who are doing this who think it’s okay — and they’re getting away with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eli Diaz, a second-year pre-economics and accounting major, also voiced his concerns over the language used in the timely warnings, particularly over the word “victim.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I heard Ariana, the Title IX officer, use the word ‘victim’ to refer to survivors and I feel like it’s been widely accepted that ‘victim’ isn’t the right word to use for people that are survivors of sexual violence. That felt like a strong disconnect, especially coming from someone that is from Title IX,” Diaz said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlock explained to forum attendees that the university must be careful when it comes to the use of the term “survivor” compared to “victim” or a neutral term such as “complainant.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we’re trying to hold someone accountable, it actually puts us in a less credible position to use the term ‘survivor.’ We are expected to be neutral, and if our investigators are making this linguistic assumption of the truth, it actually degrades the credibility of the case of the investigation when it goes before a hearing or a trial,” Ashlock said during the forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn further mentioned that in the immediate future, the Task Force for Safer Social Events — an ongoing project organized by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, Associated Students President Alison Sir and Klawunn — will attempt to bring organizations from all over the community, including IFC, the OSL and the Isla Vista Community Services District, among others, to enact change for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, one student believed that allowing IFC to take part in the task force could lead to a bias in the task force’s actions, referring back to the self-imposed moratorium. Armistead countered by stating that not including IFC would be counteractive to the change trying to be made. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here’s the thing, if we’re going to make change, we’ve got to make change all over. And I think it can be really dangerous to not include any entity,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important that we all work together as a community to make some really positive change. I’m not comfortable not having IFC nor any group on this task force. We </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have to</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work together to make change.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Senate’s statement was posted on the A.S. Senate Facebook page on Nov. 1. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been three allegations of sexual assault brought against Sigma Pi; the first two were reported by the Nexus on </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oct. 24</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while the third was reported by the university through a timely warning sent out on Oct. 28. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura was the one who first brought up the recent allegations to the Senate during the Wednesday night meeting, emphasizing the importance of making survivors of sexual assault aware of the resources available to them through A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate then went into a working group to write a draft of the statement, which was later posted on Facebook alongside a note encouraging attendance of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a town hall hosted by Students Against Sexual Assault on Nov. 14.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement condemns “unsafe spaces” and “any student organization that perpetuates the harassment and abuse of any person”; it also calls for the UCSB administration to respond to “environments that enable sexual violence.” The statement did not name any particular organization or environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its statement, the Senate added that it believes these allegations are not isolated incidents and are instead “a reflection of a greater culture that allows sexual violence to continue.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This harmful culture needs to be addressed and stopped,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Vice President Alli Adam echoed similar points in a statement to the Nexus, stating A.S. “[doesn’t] condone what’s going on in our own community and [has] no problem standing up to fellow community members and confronting this unfortunate culture.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also mentioned that the Senate emphasized the need to demonstrate support rather than simply listing resources for survivors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Something that [the senators] brought up that I thought was really powerful is they didn’t want to just list resources because students kind of feel like that’s redirecting the issue, but [the senators] all were willing to make themselves available as well. So I thought that was a really unique perspective to take, and I’m proud of that,” Adam said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement released by the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) parallels the Senate’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one should have to spend their nights out in fear. It’s on us to take a deep look at the culture that enabled this incident, and correct it,” Board President Spencer Brandt said in the statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kristie Nguyen, board director for the I.V. CSD, the problem doesn’t lie within Greek life as </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some social media posts have </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said, but with the individual.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to see [people] blaming the Greek community for recreating this culture because this culture has already been prevalent throughout society. It’s a huge epidemic,” Nguyen said in a phone call with the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you look into it, a lot of people in the Greek community – like fraternities – don’t condone that kind of behavior. It was more of an individual choice to make those disgusting decisions to do that to people. We shouldn’t be blaming anyone but the people who have done what they did.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD’s statement was sent out on Oct. 24 — prior to the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB to all students on Oct. 28.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said he was “incredibly frustrated and disgusted” by the alleged crime in the timely warning sent out on Monday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that under all the scrutiny that the university is providing [Sigma Pi] right now, there was another incident, really speaks to the institutional problem, a problem with the culture,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement also lists a variety of resources for survivors of sexual assault offered by the I.V. CSD and UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t just stand by without doing something. While we’re already providing services like our interpersonal violence and sexual education and prevention program along with the survivor resource center, we also just want to continue to make it clear what our values are and how we will support survivors,” I.V. CSD Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will believe survivors and we will stand with that.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

CSD) meeting. The updated budget still features many of the original proposal’s designs, such as the beer garden and the music stages; however, cuts were still made to several areas to reduce the event’s overall cost, including having less fencing and fewer portable toilets, information kiosks and targeted Facebook advertisements. The updated budget also cut the number of giveaways in half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Isla-Vista-April-2020-Event-Production-Budget-Reduction-Budget-159K.pdf\">new proposal</a> further removes one of the music stages, a reduction of $7,000, that could potentially be brought back with a sponsorship — something that UC Santa Barbara’s Associated Students (A.S.) could potentially fulfill, according to I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud presented a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Isla-Vista-April-2020-Event-Production-Budget-Sheet3.pdf\">variety of options</a> to enable the board to fund the event during Tuesday’s meeting, including asking UC Santa Barbara to fund the street </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lighting project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as drawing money from different sources in the I.V. CSD budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the reductions, some board members still expressed concern over the lack of official partners and sponsorships to help cover the cost of the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of last Tuesday’s meeting, no other entity has agreed to fund the festival. However, Board President Spencer Brandt named UCSB, A.S., Santa Barbara City College, the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District, the city of Goleta and local businesses as current potential sponsors for the festival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the number that we have in front of us with no else at the table with us, I’m not comfortable using our revenue for it, in the full amount,” Director Ethan Bertrand said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Kristie Nguyen agreed with Bertrand’s concerns and suggested scaling down the size and cost of the event to gauge the community’s response, and afterward, determine if the festival was a success and warrants a greater investment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we find out if [the spring festival] is going to be successful, then we can start funding more money. But as of right now, we don’t know the success rate, and we won’t know until it actually happens,” Nguyen said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has also shouldered a portion of its festival budget under Operating Expenses but stressed that the Safety and Security portion is “NOT THE PLACE TO CUT” in the budget, as stated in the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been continuously telling people that the reason why we want to do this is not because we want Deltopia to be shut down. It’s because we want to draw people — a certain amount of people, not everyone, but a certain amount of people — away from the [Del Playa] area because that is where the public safety problems are,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to gather community feedback regarding the spring festival, the I.V.

Loop, which will include three music stages, a space for games and activities and a beer garden. </span><em>Britta Good / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an open-source transformational arts and music festival</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, first introduced the idea for a spring festival during Deltopia to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Tuesday’s meeting, I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt expressed the board’s sentiments that Deltopia in its current state, a fundamentally disorganized event that draws thousands of out-of-towners, creates a public safety concern for the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/deltopia-sees-increase-in-arrests-decrease-in-medical-transports/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595552000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQrErSI9EG7M_swcZiaWwgXZE0SA\">Deltopia 2019</a> saw 94 citations, 38 arrests, 19 medical transports and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-10/police-arrest-two-deltopia-visitors-on-armed-robbery-charges/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595548000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHa24jfKBR84l_Epw29OokNZ08eXw\">one serial robbery</a> — causing the month of April to have the highest number of arrests in comparison to previous months.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Deltopia, as it exists, is not a safe environment. We see a spike in physical assaults, in sexual assaults. We see a spike in medical transports as a result of alcohol and drugs,” Brandt said at the meeting on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our board’s thought has always been to provide people with a fun alternative where the community has the ability to plan the event, plan the content of the event and have a better handle on what the security presence looks like that we can change the overall feel to be a much safer event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Proposal-V2-Includes-Budget-Site-Map-Security-Plan-IV-April-Event-2020-4.pdf\">current proposal</a> has the festival centered in the I.V. Loop, which will include three music stages, a space for games and activities and a beer garden featuring local breweries. The plan also includes detailed information regarding local community collaboration, security and the budget for the overall project, with expenses totalling $184,850.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire board unanimously expressed concern over the price tag of the event. According to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD, there are two main options to cover the cost of the event in the budget: a UCSB grant, or the $100,000 reserve allocation currently in the budget. UCSB can grant $93,000 under one condition — the university must reach an agreement with the I.V. CSD as to what the expenses are for. However, Director George Thurlow expressed doubts as to whether UCSB would be willing to fund a community festival versus placing the money directly into public safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ways to cover the cost of the festival could include sponsorships from local businesses and funding from the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD). Carlos Lopez, chairperson for the IVRPD, attended the meeting and said the IVRPD Board of Directors is willing to negotiate partially funding the festival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lopez also suggested a system of pre-registration for the festival where people could sign up online for a QR code that would grant them access to the event. A safety agreement and confirmation of residence in I.V. would accompany the QR code to deter outsiders from attending the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sara Marvel, a director for Lucidity, possible sources of revenue could also come from local sponsorships and the beer garden. Tickets could be sold for the beer garden, in the style of a beer tasting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity will also be foregoing the addition of food trucks to the festival — something they predicted would cause pushback from local businesses and go against their vision of a community-controlled event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marvel emphasized the Safety, Security and Harm Reduction Plan of the proposal to better respond to the annual problems Deltopia brings. It includes the Guardian Team, a security service “with focus on de-escalation, harm reduction, and crisis management,” <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardianteam.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1570743595560000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1c8D18DVtMBpd6p5IRgQgFRpfKw\">according to its website</a>, as well as a large medical team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things we really pride ourselves on at Lucidity is we have a very, very well-staffed medical team on site. If anybody has any immediate emergency, we have the ability to support them right there and then,” Marvel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a proposal to end the event around 4 p.m. to funnel people toward UCSB’s campus event, The Warm Up, which typically begins at 6 p.m., Alan Avila, co-founder and head of security at Lucidity, said he is willing to negotiate to make the security and medical teams available until 10 p.m. or midnight should a situation arise where they are needed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the festival’s budget still remains the primary concern for the directors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Have any of you electeds gone out in the community and said, ‘This is going to cost 180k of your utility user [tax], [and] you’re paying [for] it?’” Thurlow asked the board members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Ethan Bertrand echoed Thurlow’s thoughts and voiced his own concerns regarding the I.V. CSD’s ability to tackle the project as a newly formed entity and suggested approaching UCSB’s Associated Students for greater collaboration with the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am still a little bit concerned about the potential for this being a much bigger event during an already unsanctioned event,” Bertrand said. “I am definitely in support of scaling this down in any way that we can and aspiring to, in the next few years, put on this full event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, the next I.V. CSD meeting will have a more in-depth revision of the budget, as well as possible updates from negotiations with other organizations. With the festival plans requiring months of preparation, Abboud says the board will have to make a decision soon over whether or not to actually hold the festival, possibly by the last I.V. CSD meeting of October or the first meeting of November.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

CSD), gave an update regarding the room’s condition at the I.V. CSD meeting on Sept. 24. The I.V. CSD normally uses the Community Room to hold its meetings every other Tuesday, but the board meeting relocated to St. George Youth Center due to the air conditioning leaks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Abboud, the two leaks — one in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system and the other in the walls from water pipes — were first discovered on Sept. 13. Abboud was then told by Santa Barbara County’s general services that it would be two weeks before the leaks were fixed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, on Sept. 20, Abboud said he was told that the room would be closed indefinitely until a team can come in and inspect it due to mold being discovered in the walls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re fixing the HVAC leak soon, but the leak in the wall with the piping needs to wait for the hazmat to come in. There was mold in the walls because of the leaks,” Abboud said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New cabinets, flooring, drywall and paint are required to repair the damage and Grey hopes to have the room reopened by the last week of October.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a bad situation, but I know we’re going to be working hard so the county is getting this done,” Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V.

I decided [during] my freshman year to get involved and see if I can help out as much as I can,” Griffin said in a statement to the board prior to his appointment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin said he first saw the open seat while </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-22/recap-external-vice-president-for-local-affairs-candidate-forum/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">running for Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/campus-united-reclaims-executive-branch-stronghold-maintains-senate-majority/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter 2019 elections</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At the time, he realized that he didn’t want to get elected as both EVPLA and IVRPD director and not have sufficient time for both positions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After losing [the EVPLA] election, I decided that this was another way I could give back, and the board position was still open. I was lucky enough to get it, and I’m happy to be on it,” Griffin said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the newest member of the board, one of Griffin’s first goals is to renovate two of the parks in I.V.: Walter Capps Park and Pardall Gardens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin said Walter Capps Park, a large tract of dirt and grass located oceanside at the beginning of the 67 block of Del Playa Drive, has recently been discussed as a site for renovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been in the talks recently to put together a plan to build a park there and to have different facilities like work-out stations and shade structures. So I’d like to be a part of the design of that which will be happening hopefully within the next year,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also wants to renovate Pardall Gardens, which neighbors Lao Wang on Pardall Road and currently houses a few benches and sparse shrubbery. Griffin wants to “transition the park to become a space utilized by students and community members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is also looking forward to the implementation of the first solar table at the southeast corner of People’s Park. The solar table will house outlets charged by solar panels and was a project initially started in the EVPLA office under Jeike Meijer, who served as EVPLA for the 2018-19 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The foundation has been laid, and the table will hopefully be installed and ready by Fall Quarter 2019, according to Griffin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To familiarize himself with the IVRPD’s revenue, Griffin said he intends to join the Finance Committee.

The branch received a grant from the </span><a href=\"https://theharwoodinstitute.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harwood Institute for Public Innovation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the summer 2018 to help gather data on library needs for Zone 4 — </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/rezoning-will-provide-i-v-with-more-library-access/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a library service area that includes Goleta and I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to library technician Marie Crusinberry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re here to have a conversation to better understand your aspirations for the community,” Crusinberry told the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board of Directors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crusinberry began by asking the directors what they would want for I.V., bringing up the idea of a local branch in the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Ethan Bertrand stressed the importance of children’s programs for I.V., along with language access programs, which provide translation and interpretation services, and technology access programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Kristie Nguyen and Board President Spencer Brandt both suggested library service ideas geared toward college students. While Nguyen proposed extended hours at the Goleta Valley Library during exam weeks to give students another study space, Brandt spoke about possibly increasing the number of common college textbooks and course reserves for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Let’s say it’s a biology class or that you’ve got 700 people in this lecture hall. It’d be great to keep some reserves of those types of textbooks and make those accessible to students,” Brandt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that that really will help in terms of making the project a success by bringing the college students in and having that community atmosphere that’s all inclusive.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice President Robert Geis raised his concerns over the divide between I.V.’s youth and the Goleta Valley Library, citing the physical distance between the two as a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The library’s really important to those young kids, so how do we get either library services here or get [kids to a library]? My idea is to get them to the library,” Geis said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crusinberry recommended three possible initiatives to get the I.V. community involved in the Goleta Valley Library: a bookmobile, a branch in I.V. or a direct bus shuttle connecting I.V. and the library.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bookmobile would be able to bring books directly to I.V. This would allow people to check out or return books easily, without having to go to the library — something that Crusinberry suggested when addressing Director Jay Freeman’s idea for a book drop-off in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The library has not had a bookmobile since its former one was sold years ago, according to Crusinberry. However, she says the option has resurfaced and is being discussed again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a library branch in I.V. was highly supported, it was seen as a long-term project with obstacles. Director Bertrand did note that the opening of the Isla Vista Community Center in August might be able to provide a space for library programs but the bookmobile and bus shuttle were seen as more immediate solutions to bring library services into I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board seemed to favor a direct bus shuttle from I.V. to the library in collaboration with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD). Director Bertrand stated that a shuttle to the library will be something he plans to address with SBMTD at a later date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just trying to learn and get information because there has been talk about the underserved in I.V. But we need to understand what that means. You can’t just say, ‘Well, we want a library.’ There’s a lot as far as what you want,” Crusinberry said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to make sure that we have our data that shows what we should be doing with our money that we have.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2103.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/arturomartinez123/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arturo Martinez Rivera</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Arturo Martinez Rivera is an asst. news editor at the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
