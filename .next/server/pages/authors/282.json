Our main events are the general meetings we have biweekly in a big room where we invite [guest speakers],” Kim said. “We weren’t completely sure how to make all that virtual.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, after re-evaluating their options, Kim and the AMA executive board decided that the AMA would continue general meetings through email newsletters sharing webinars on various marketing topics and slide decks with project updates and internship opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything’s just been really difficult to transition to. We want to run our organization while still being flexible to everyone’s circumstances, and so by doing a newsletter format … they can access the slide deck and the webinar or the event any time they want to,” Kim explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to transitioning meetings online, student organizations have also been forced to cancel upcoming in-person events and to consider the prospect of hosting virtual replacements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frances Woo, a third-year sociology major and current editor-in-chief of Um… Magazine, an online and print publication for marginalized voices, said that the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the organization’s plans for print distribution and its benefit concert fundraiser.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Normally what we do every quarter is we collect submissions, compile and design them into a physical print magazine, and then we have a launch event where we distribute them all around IV and on campus,” Woo said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We usually have a benefit concert fundraiser too, but because we can’t do that physically, we’re trying to figure out remote ways to do it, maybe like a livestream session or sort of a video we can put out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there will be no physical print for the magazine this quarter, Woo said they will instead focus on their </span><a href=\"https://www.ummagazine.online/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> platform. Um… Magazine is currently accepting art submissions for its </span><a href=\"https://www.ummagazine.online/submission\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote volume</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and creative competition, both of which are projects that aim to shed light on the social implications of the coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intersectional Feminists (IFEM), a community organization centered around intersectionality, education and empowerment of marginalized voices, is also addressing the social impacts of coronavirus by serving as a resource for students, according to Ky Youssef, a third-year sociology and environmental studies major and president of IFEM. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We completely acknowledge this is a hard time for some for many reasons and understand the hardships with some people going back to their families. Our social media is open for anyone to come talk to,” Youssef said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IFEM has opted to forgo holding general meetings through online methods such as Zoom — the organization is instead having officers do weekly takeovers on the Intersectional Feminists </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ucsbintersectfeminists/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to educate members on topics each officer is passionate about, Youssef explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did one last week by our historian, Alana, who did a spiel about mental health tips during this quarantine. She talked about grounding techniques which can help with anxiety,” Youssef said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of fostering social connections that are typically forged in person, the transition to online operation has proven to be an ongoing challenge for student organizations. Kim noted how online methods of communication, while effective in conveying information, lack the personal nature of in-person interactions that help create a sense of community among AMA members.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think our organization benefits a lot from having that community aspect … It’s been challenging to continue that priority for our organization, like the face-to-face network, because you can establish a lot of strong professional connections just through that,” Kim said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shift to digital operation has also had a considerable effect on member participation, as it is increasingly difficult for organizations to track meeting attendance and facilitate projects that normally occur in person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course, we have a lower number of members attending [general meetings]. We’re not completely sure if it’s people going through the slide deck and watching the webinar and forgetting to sign in, or if members aren’t participating,” Kim explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, group projects in Um… Magazine have been challenging to facilitate solely through Zoom, according to Woo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the general members want to work on group projects with each other, but it’s hard, especially with Zoom, where only one person can talk at a time, to establish those connections and especially new connections with new members,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trying to adapt to quarantine life and online courses, many student organization leaders have yet to establish a long-term operation plan in the event that remote instruction and </span><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/coronavirus-distancing-new-normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social distancing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> progress beyond spring quarter and summer session. As of now, student organizations are taking it day by day, focusing on what they can accomplish through digital means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef noted that while IFEM is unsure about future plans, it will continue to remain an active resource by attending virtual town halls and education webinars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, spring quarter will be a time for student organizations to experiment with digital modes of outreach and make the appropriate adjustments to create a concrete method of operation, as explained by Woo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of what we decide this quarter will just be prolonged as long as social distancing goes. This quarter is going to be a lot of testing stuff out and seeing what works and what doesn’t,” Woo said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94243\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94243\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-30/the-elephant-in-the-zoom-how-student-orgs-are-adapting-to-virtual-member-engagement/","id":1801,"author":{"id":282,"name":"Michelle Lee"},"related":[1800,1799,1798],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/282"}},"__N_SSG":true}
