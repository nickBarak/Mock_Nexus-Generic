On one hand, I got to read a second book by Harper Lee—a sequel to <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, no less. On the other hand, I couldn’t understand why a perfect book needed this mediocre sequel. Far from living up to its predecessor‘s reputation, <em>Watchman</em> undermined much of what made <em>Mockingbird</em> a masterpiece of American fiction.</p>\n<p><em>Watchman</em> reintroduces many familiar characters from the previous novel, and many of them haven’t aged gracefully. Now 72 years old, Atticus Finch has devolved from a symbolic civils right sympathizer into an arthritic senior whose stance on racial equality has deteriorated alongside his body. Where once stood an undisputed hero of the American justice system now sits a crippled conservative overwhelmed by the growing momentum of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>\n<p>The Atticus that you knew in high school is long gone. Midway through the novel, Papa Finch upsets Scout by attending by attending a Citizens’ Council Meeting, which is essentially a bigots soapbox meeting. In a subsequent conversation between Scout and Atticus, our former civil rights advocate refers to black men as incompetent children—a far cry from the hero who defended the innocent Tom Robinson in a hopeless case two decades prior.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Meanwhile, Atticus’s daughter has grown up to be a calm and contemplative woman, though she remains the same mischievous girl in spirit. Even though Jean Louise Finch has outgrown her childhood nickname, I’m still going to call her Scout. Unlike in <em>Mockingbird</em>, Scout doesn’t narrate <em>Watchman</em>, instead acting as the main character of a third person story. The resulting style is comparatively detached and cool, as if to mirror Scout’s discomfort with the formality of adulthood.</p>\n<p>One of the saving graces of <em>Watchman</em> is its humor. The funny moments are the ones that best resonate with its predecessor’s charm and bring the characters to life. One of my favorite scenes involves Scout being (falsely) accused of skinny dipping at night, to which Atticus replies, “I hope you weren’t doing the backstroke.” Scout’s eccentric Uncle Jack, who was largely pushed into the background of Mockingbird, also gets more time in the spotlight. Uncle Jack helps Scout reach an understanding of her father, offering wisdom and wit peppered with obscure references to Victorian poetry.</p>\n<p>Other fun moments were the flashbacks interspersed throughout <em>Watchman</em> to expand on the childhood-centered plot of <em>Mockingbird</em>. Scout’s recollections show how a brash and tomboyish girl matured into a sensible young woman. Unfortunately, these touching scenes always seemed to occur totally separate from the main story, in a way that distracted from the more pressing issues of Scout’s evolving relationship with her father. As much as I enjoyed the glimpses of nostalgia, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that they were forced into this sequel.</p>\n<p>In fact, if I had to sum up <em>Watchman</em> in one word, it would be “forced.” The lesson at its end is ambiguous, just like Atticus himself. The conclusion amounts to Scout destroying her long-cherished vision of her father so that she can begin to regard him as a normal man. In other words, Atticus succeeds in disillusioning both his daughter and the audience. It’s an inadequate resolution one would expect from the work of an inexperienced writer.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, <em>Watchman</em> is the work of an inexperienced writer. Supposedly it is the recently “rediscovered” story that Harper Lee devised <em>before</em> reworking it into her great American novel. As the author is now almost 90, and never intended to publish another book, I side with the not unpopular opinion that <em>Watchman</em> should have stayed lost. It has its moments—it’s still Harper Lee, after all—but it’s best read as a study of the writer’s stylistic growth, or even as a rough draft.  If you’ve picked it up expecting a good story, prepare to be let down. Just hope you can handle reality better than Scout did.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/go-set-a-watchman-the-sequel-we-didnt-need/","id":6950,"author":{"id":180,"name":"Jason Chun"},"related":[6949,6948,6947],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Sequel We Didn’t Need","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Literature","publish_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/960.jpg?resize=960%2C540&ssl=1","description":"If the goal of Go Set a Watchman was to leave me both satisfied and disappointed, it succeeded.

The resulting style is comparatively detached and cool, as if to mirror Scout’s discomfort with the formality of adulthood.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>One of the saving graces of <em>Watchman</em> is its humor. The funny moments are the ones that best resonate with its predecessor’s charm and bring the characters to life. One of my favorite scenes involves Scout being (falsely) accused of skinny-dipping at night, on which Atticus comments, “I hope you weren’t doing the backstroke.” Scout’s eccentric Uncle Jack, who was largely pushed into the background of <em>Mockingbird</em>, also gets more time in the spotlight. Uncle Jack helps Scout reach an understanding of her father, offering wisdom and wit peppered with obscure references to Victorian poetry.</p>\n<p>Other fun moments were the flashbacks interspersed throughout <em>Watchman</em> to expand on the childhood-centered plot of <em>Mockingbird</em>. Scout’s recollections show how a brash and tomboyish girl matured into a sensible young woman. Unfortunately, these touching scenes always seemed to occur totally separately from the main story, in a way that distracted from the more pressing issues of Scout’s evolving relationship with her father. As much as I enjoyed the glimpses of nostalgia, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that they were forced into this sequel.</p>\n<p>In fact, if I had to sum up <em>Watchman</em> in one word, it would be “forced.” The lesson at its end is ambiguous, just like Atticus himself. The conclusion amounts to Scout destroying her long-cherished vision of her father so that she can begin to regard him as a normal man. In other words, Atticus succeeds in disillusioning both his daughter and the audience. It’s an inadequate resolution one would expect from the work of an inexperienced writer.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, <em>Watchman</em> <em>is</em> the work of an inexperienced writer. Supposedly it is the recently “rediscovered” story that Harper Lee devised <em>before</em> reworking it into her great American novel. As the author is now almost 90 and never intended to publish another book, I side with the not unpopular opinion that <em>Watchman</em> should have stayed lost. It has its moments — it’s still Harper Lee, after all — but it’s best read as a study of the writer’s stylistic growth, or even as a rough draft.  If you’ve picked it up expecting a good story, prepare to be let down. Just hope you can handle reality better than Scout did.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

and author Kati Marton held a talk at Corwin Pavilion on Wednesday regarding her book, <em>The Great Escape: Nine Jews Who Fled Hitler and Changed the World</em>.</p>\n<p>The Hungarian-born daughter of journalists who spent two years in prison for false charges of spying, and the granddaughter of Jews who were killed at Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust, Marton moved with her family to Maryland in 1956 following the Hungarian Revolution.</p>\n<p>Marton’s book follows the lives of nine influential figures, including physicists Leo Szilard, Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, who convinced Albert Einstein to warn then-President Franklin Roosevelt of Germany’s development of nuclear weapons and paved the way for the Manhattan Project, as well as many other reputable figures such as inventor John von Neumann,<em> Darkness at Noon</em> author Arthur Koestler, photographers Robert Capa and Andre Kertesz as well as filmmakers Alexander Korda and Michael Curtiz, who directed <em>Casablanca </em>and other well-known films.</p>\n<p>Marton said she chose the nine individuals because they all spent time in her birthplace of Budapest. According to Marton, she wanted to investigate the influence the ancient European capital had on each character and their intellect.</p>\n<p>“Nobody had created a group out of them, and that was what I tried to do, to discover what was in the espresso in Budapest that had created this fantastic explosion of talent,” Marton said.</p>\n<p>Marton said although the nine men were secular Jews, their lives also began to change with the mass persecution of Jewish people at the time.</p>\n<p>“[The nine] were very aware of the fact that their parents and grandparents had not been given these opportunities; that just a generation before, they had been stuck in muddy villages … with very limited scope for ambition,” Marton said. “So they were men in a hurry.”</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Lyiam Galo was one of the Instructional Development students who filmed the event for UCTV, and said Marton’s talk effectively handled unsettling topics while making them accessible to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>“[Marton] was super receptive to questions,” Galo said. “The subject matter was dark, but she managed to incorporate humor.”</p>\n<p>This event was the first of nine that will be hosted this year by the Taubman Symposia in Jewish Studies at UCSB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Such casual humor should be expected of any 40-year friendship, especially when it involves Barry, creator of the comic strip <em>Ernie Pook’s Comeek</em> and author of several novels, and Groening, best known for his comic strip <em>Life in Hell</em> and cartoon sitcoms “The Simpsons” and “Futurama.”</p>\n<p>The event, arranged by UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures, attracted a crowd of several hundred. Audience members ranged from young children to elderly couples, most in semi-formal attire. The huge theater walls were bedecked with balconies and lanterns to resemble the exterior of Spanish Mediterranean buildings. Depthless black covered the ceiling, and one could easily picture themself in a tranquil nighttime courtyard — at least, until the show began.</p>\n<p>First came iconic clips of the Simpsons and their antics: Bart showing Lisa his (accurate) illustrated prediction of their father being crushed by a garage door, Homer hurtling down a hill on skis as mounds of snow striked his groin and the entire family suffering epileptic seizures induced by a Japanese cartoon. The audience was roaring with laughter before Groening and Barry even took their seats in a corner of the stage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The friends began their talk by recounting details of childhood. Barry described her Filipino grandmother, who sang in the kitchen and told far-fetched tales of monsters that attacked misbehaving children. Groening discussed how his family members influenced his most renowned characters. While cycling through a wealth of family pictures — taken by his father, a professional photographer — Groening revealed that Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie and Abe Simpson were named after his real life father, mother, sisters and grandfather, respectively.</p>\n<p>The discussion shifted to Evergreen State College, which the cartoonists both attended in the ’70s. Barry described the Oregon school as a liberal place where “everyone thought hippies would be around forever.” Groening first met Barry in college, upon learning that Barry had received a reply after writing to <em>Catch-22</em> author Joseph Heller, one of Groening’s favorite writers. The cartoonists recalled a number of their college exploits, from Barry’s temporary work as a nude model to Groening’s position as editor of the school paper, where he announced he would print “anything anyone wanted.”</p>\n<p>From there, Groening and Barry started talking about their artistic work. Barry, an experienced art teacher, encouraged artists and writers to work by hand rather than computer, because hands don’t have delete buttons. She played a video, showing lines drawn by a child juxtaposed with those drawn by Picasso in an abstract sketch and those drawn by a “physics dude” in a diagram. Barry insisted that such lines were alike in that they were all created by people getting ideas.</p>\n<p>Barry then showed the hilarious (but not entirely unrecognizable) results of her adult students sketching Marge Simpson for a minute with their eyes closed, to prove that adults who’d stopped drawing for years could still find joy in creating art. Not to be exempted, Groening and Barry made their own blind drawings on stage. Groening joked that he would sell his fairly accurate representation of Marge for five dollars, as Barry cackled at her own flawed attempt.</p>\n<p>While Barry leaned back in her chair feigning boredom when it was Groening’s turn to talk, and Groening laughed loudly at Barry’s humiliating stories, it was easy to see that this was a lasting friendship. The cartoonists ended their effortless exchange with an emotional hug, which might have lasted longer if they hadn’t reserved time to answer questions from the audience.</p>\n<p>The first question came from dedicated fan Matt Wallace, who asked if he could buy Groening’s drawing. Wallace, proudly displaying the sketch after the Q&amp;A session, stated, “I met Matt probably 20, 25 years ago … He was doing a book signing pre-‘Simpsons.’”</p>\n<p>Lucky, who at age 10 was the youngest audience member to ask questions, said one of her teachers “claimed” to have dated Groening’s father. Though a stunned Groening couldn’t confirm the statement, Lucky said of the event, “It’s really cool because I always watch ‘The Simpsons,’ and [once I] was Lisa for Halloween.”</p>\n<p>Fans old and new left the Arlington Theatre laughing. That night Groening and Barry were living proof of the agelessness of friendship and humor.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57026\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57026\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-18/from-childhood-to-college-to-cartooning-an-evening-with-matt-groening-and-lynda-barry/","id":6038,"author":{"id":180,"name":"Jason Chun"},"related":[6037,6036,6035],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/180"}},"__N_SSG":true}
