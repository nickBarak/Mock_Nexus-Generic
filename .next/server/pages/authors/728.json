With no shortage of collaborations and multi-disc concept albums, it is hard for MCs and producers to stand out or be truly innovative. That is, unless the MCs in question are Eligh and The Grouch. In 2014 the duo released something unprecedented in the hip hop universe: a triple-disc album entitled <em>The Tortoise and the Crow. </em>It includes a collaborative disc of the two called <em>333</em>, a solo disc by The Grouch called<em> Lighthouses</em> and a solo disc from Eligh called <em>Nomads.</em> <em>The Tortoise and the Crow </em>received widespread critical acclaim, even debuting at No.1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The Grouch and Eligh, often referred to as G&amp;E, have been touring extensively since this release, and on Friday, Dec. 4 they’ll be playing an all-ages show at the Velvet Jones in downtown Santa Barbara. Doors open at 8:00 p.m. and tickets are $20.</p>\n<p>The Grouch and Eligh have a massive discography they’ll be playing from in addition to their already lengthy latest album. Even as solo artists outside G&amp;E, the two have been extremely prolific.</p>\n<p>The Grouch was born and raised in Oakland and was molded by the underground hip hop scene in the Bay Area. This inspired him to break into music himself, and he began what would be a life-long journey into the world of music in 1994. He released at least one solo album every year from 1995 until 2000. He still releases music as a solo artist but has slowed down considerably due to the amount of collaborating he does with Eligh and other rap collectives. To date, The Grouch has released 17 solo albums.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Grouch met Eligh in the late 1990s when Eligh moved from Los Angeles to the Bay Area. They became fast friends, and it became obvious that they had chemistry in the studio. Since then the duo have released five albums, the most recent being <em>333</em>, the collaborative disc from <em>The Tortoise and the Crow.</em></p>\n<p>In addition to his work with The Grouch, Eligh has a multitude of solo albums under his belt. Eligh began making music as a high schooler in the early 1990s in Los Angeles and since then hasn’t slowed down. He released his first solo album <em>As They </em>Pass in 1996. Since then Eligh has released 18 albums, sometimes as Eligh and sometimes under the alias Gandalf.</p>\n<p>Something particularly notable about Eligh is the magnitude to which he lets his personal life permeate his music. In 2005 Eligh struggled with a heroin addiction so severe it almost took his life. He checked himself into a treatment center and since then has been strictly straight-edge, free from all drugs and alcohol for the last decade. Many of Eligh’s solo albums reflect this, and his music since 2005 has been especially personal and inspiring for many. The list of artists he’s worked with is also impressive, including names such as Company Flow, Pretty Lights and even John Cena.</p>\n<p>Whether they play music from any of their combined 35 solo albums or from their five collaborative efforts, the show The Grouch and Eligh put on is sure to satisfy.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hefdWgnkyU&amp;spfreload=10</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66936\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66936\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/underground-rap-legends-eligh-and-the-grouch-to-play-velvet-jones/","id":6835,"author":{"id":728,"name":"Joey Goodman"},"related":[6834,6833,6832],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blitzen Trapper: a Socially Acceptable Country Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/btlizen-trapper.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/btlizen-trapper.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"There I stood, a beacon of teenage streetwear among a sea of 20-somethings in flannels.

The crowd to see Blitzen Trapper on the night of Veterans Day at SOhO was not a varied bunch. The band took the stage at just after 9 p.m., drawing in the white folks from all corners of the venue. Eventually the crowd reached a decent size, especially considering it was a Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Blitzen Trapper wasted little time on the formalities of crowd interaction. When asked by lead singer Eric Earley how they were doing, the crowd responded with a surprisingly enthusiastic “Wooo!” Earley and I were both taken aback. “Not bad for a Wednesday night,” he mused, appreciative of the energy of the relatively small audience.</p>\n<p>The five-piece jumped straight into the tunes and sounded undeniably tight. Earley’s voice neither cracked nor faltered, carrying over an audience which hung on his every lyric. Drummer Brian Adrian Koch perfectly propelled the band forward, a metronome who knew how to have fun. The group has been together for well over a decade, and it was obvious in their performance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Every band member clearly loved playing together on stage, and everyone in the audience loved being there to experience it.

One of their high points was not even one of their songs. They covered “Come Together” by the Beatles, instilling it with a hard American groove that the boys from across the pond never could. That number was impossibly danceable, and even the least country of us there couldn’t resist getting down with it.</p>\n<p>This first set of songs ranged from sounding like Neil Young to Lynyrd Skynyrd, eventually ending with another hard rock song, one of their own called “Fletcher.” It was at this point I realized I was enjoying myself, because I was disappointed to see them leave the stage so soon.</p>\n<p>The band wasn’t actually done — maybe just testing audience reception or regrouping backstage. Before long three of the five guys walked back on stage. The drummer, lead singer and keyboardist took control of the stage, but the tone was suddenly different. Koch the drummer took to a microphone, and the keyboardist opted for a natural piano sound. The trio played through a few ballads, lush with harmony and soothing instrumentation.</p>\n<p>Soon the bassist and rhythm guitarist were ready to rejoin the stage, and the reunited Blitzen Trapper played two finale songs. First they played their biggest hit to date, a song called “Furr” from their 2007 album of the same name. Immediately the crowd roared, then sang along with every word, creating a chorus much larger than seemed possible.</p>\n<p>Finally the band closed with another groovy tune, one called “All Across This Land,” from their newest album also of the same name. This song is ripe with syncopation and distorted guitar riffs. The crowd’s energy peaked as the whole place rocked and rolled with the band. Couples danced, Blitzen Trapper jammed out and smiled, dudes threw up Metal Horns half ironically, girls did that dance where they look at each other and flip their hair around. It was a grand ol’ time that unfortunately came to an end.</p>\n<p>It was only after seeing them live that one really gets to realize where Blitzen Trapper sits in the makeup of the music scene. If you ask a Blitzen Trapper fan to classify their music, the fan says “rock” or “folk.” However, if you played Blitzen Trapper for someone who hadn’t heard it before, most wouldn’t hesitate to call it country. The conclusion is this: Blitzen Trapper provides those who refuse to like country music with a taste of what they’re missing out on.</p>\n<p>Trying to classify Blitzen Trapper is difficult and ultimately futile. They put on an energetic, lively show that was more enjoyable than one would expect. While they can’t be pigeonholed into the labels “country” or “folk” or “rock,” Blitzen Trapper put on a damn good show that ended up being a lot of fun.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66574\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66574\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/blitzen-trapper-a-socially-acceptable-country-show/","id":6858,"author":{"id":728,"name":"Joey Goodman"},"related":[6857,6856,6855],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blitzen Trapper To Come to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Blitzen-Trapper.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Blitzen-Trapper.jpg?resize=960%2C640&ssl=1","description":"The music of Portland-based group Blitzen Trapper is, just like all things from Portland, weird.

This quintet is nearing epic in both its age and discography, and has consistently straddled the lines between country, folk, and alternative rock. Their latest album, <em>All Across This Land</em>, was released on Oct. 2, and was self-described by the band as their “best one yet.” Blitzen Trapper’s national tour promoting the album will be making a stop at Santa Barbara’s own SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club on Nov. 11. The doors open at 7 p.m., and the band goes on at 8, wasting no time with an opener; tickets are $18.</p>\n<p>Blitzen Trapper was formed in 2000, and initially used the moniker Garmonbozia. From inception until 2003, Garmonbozia was psychedelic, experimental, and exceedingly prolific. Garmonbozia was a six-piece which consisted of Erik Menteer, Brian Adrian Koch, Michael Van Pelt, Drew Laughery, Marty Marquis, and front man/songwriter Eric Earley. The band performed shows tirelessly all over the Portland area beginning in 2000. Garmonbozia went through a golden age in 2001, performing incessantly and independently recording four albums, which they sold at their concerts. Whereas most of modern Blitzen Trapper is a cross between alternative country and folk, these Garmonbozia records were closer to experimental in nature, and sounded psychedelic and unmistakably reminiscent of progressive rock.</p>\n<p>A few years and a few more albums later, the band changed its name to Blitzen Trapper. Blitzen Trapper is supposedly a reference to the lead singer’s middle school girlfriend, who had a Trapper Keeper binder with pictures of Santa’s reindeer on it, among them the one named Blitzen.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Since the name change the band has undergone many musical changes. Their very first album as Blitzen Trapper was eponymous, and while it was refreshingly experimental, it didn’t receive outstanding reviews or national recognition. It was not until their second album, <em>Field Rexx</em>, that Blitzen Trapper became commercially or critically successful. This album was a more straightforward rock record, and it drew comparisons to both Beck and Willie Nelson.</p>\n<p>Blitzen Trapper and lead Eric Earley struggled to follow up <em>Field Rexx, </em>and over the course of the next four years they released no albums after deciding not to release two because they were not up to par with the standard they had set for themselves.</p>\n<p>The band didn’t hit its stride again until 2007, when they released <em>Wild Mountain Nation</em>. This album was a new high for the band. It received strictly rave reviews, even making some end of the year “Best-of” lists.</p>\n<p>Since 2007 Blitzen Trapper has existed in a golden age. At the end of 2007 they signed to the ultra-famous indie label Sub Pop. Since then they’ve released multiple albums, all earning fantastic reviews. They performed on <em>Late Night with Conan O’Brien, </em>made a music video with <em>The Office’s</em> Rainn Wilson, and continued to chart high on various Billboard rankings.</p>\n<p>With Blitzen Trapper’s latest album they attempt to make a return to straightforward, bare-bones bluegrass, drawing inspiration from their very first albums like <em>Field Rexx</em> which brought them to where they are today. Attending their SOhO show is a guaranteed treat, and promises to be a modern alternative hoedown.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7zyfArxibk</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/blitzen-trapper-to-come-to-soho/","id":6889,"author":{"id":728,"name":"Joey Goodman"},"related":[6888,6887,6886],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/728"}},"__N_SSG":true}
