To examine the limitations of the First Amendment, inspecting the concept of freedom of speech is a good place to start. The First Amendment does not allow individuals to say whatever they want, whenever they want. The classic example that is often taught in high school settings is the metaphor of “shouting fire in a crowded theater.” Originating from the 1919 Supreme Court case </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schenck v. United States</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the “clear and present danger” test prohibits the </span><a href=\"https://lawshelf.com/videos/entry/freedom-of-speech-exceptions-categories-of-speech-not-protected\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incitement of “imminent lawless action</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” Additionally, there are </span><a href=\"https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/about/faq/which-types-of-speech-are-not-protected-by-the-first-amendment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eight other</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> types of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment, including obscenity, solicitations to commit crimes, blackmail, true threats, perjury, child pornography, fighting words and defamation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the First Amendment does prevent Congress from limiting one’s freedom of speech, it doesn’t guarantee freedom from consequences — especially from private entities. In the ever-growing age of social media, employers can easily monitor an employee’s behavior off the clock. There have been </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-fired-2011-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">numerous instances</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of employees being fired for tweets or public comments they have made. In 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/8/7/16110696/firing-google-ceo-employee-penned-controversial-memo-on-women-has-violated-its-code-of-conduct\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google fired an employee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that made a controversial memo that claimed “women had biological issues that prevented them from being as successful as men in tech.” This event demonstrates how the First Amendment’s freedom of speech does not protect citizens from the consequences of expressing their views. </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/first-amendment-explainer-trnd/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lata Nott</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the executive director of the Newseum Institute’s First Amendment Center, makes the point that “it’s the company’s right to discipline their employees’ speech.” This right only applies to private companies, such as in the Google case above. While it may seem like firing an employee over their views infringes on their freedom of speech, the First Amendment has no jurisdiction here.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the concept of freedom under the First Amendment may sound universally appealing, its power has been misconstrued, used to discriminate and infringe on the rights of others. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the First Amendment does not protect against being banned on a social media platform. In 2018, Alex Jones, host of the infamous InfoWars, had </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/06/645352618/twitter-bans-alex-jones-and-infowars-cites-abusive-behavior\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his Twitter account permanently suspended</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This led to criticism from Republicans, including President Donald Trump, that tech companies were attempting to suppress conservatives online. Despite Trump </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/tech/trump-social-media-twitter-facebook/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yelling that the United States has freedom of speech</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the First Amendment does not protect against this type of action by private companies. The First Amendment prohibits censorship by the government </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— but</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not by private organizations. To be clear, I am not arguing about the ethics of censorship; I am making the argument that these companies have a right to bar and add consequences to certain speech. Proclaiming that such actions violate the First Amendment and one’s freedom of speech are inaccurate statements that misconstrue the actual meaning of the amendment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another aspect of the First Amendment is the freedom of religion. The amendment states that the government cannot prohibit the free exercise of religion. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/your-right-religious-freedom\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Civil Liberties Union</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the First Amendment prevents the government from establishing or promoting religion in any way and gives individuals the right to worship or not worship as they choose, without punishment. Although this clause in the First Amendment is important, its intent and actual protections have been misconstrued. Religious freedom does not protect one from infringing on others’ rights. Historically, religious freedom has been used as a </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/12/05/discriminating-in-the-name-of-religion-segregationists-and-slaveholders-did-it-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guise to discriminate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against others before more legal protections were in place. Prior to the civil rights era, racial segregationists justified their actions through scripture and religion. Segregationists argued that black people were inferior to white people, referring to their interpretations of the Bible. This appropriation of the Bible thus legally allowed segregationists to claim that hiring black people would violate their religious beliefs. These legal arguments based on religion would not hold today; however, back then, there were no legal protections for marginalized groups. With the passage of the </span><a href=\"https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97&amp;page=transcript\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there is now official legal framework that denies discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, religious freedom has been used as a </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/12/05/discriminating-in-the-name-of-religion-segregationists-and-slaveholders-did-it-too/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guise to discriminate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against others before more legal protections were in place.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In more recent events, the First Amendment’s assurance of religious freedom has been misconstrued by individuals to justify discrimination against marginalized groups; these actions often go against different pieces of federal legislation, turning the words “religious freedom” into a buzzword. For example, in 2015, Kim Davis garnered national notoriety for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, even after the legalization of gay marriage through </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obergefell v. Hodges</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Despite the legalization, Davis refused to comply and claimed her right to religious freedom by saying that she made the decision “</span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/01/436557085/despite-high-court-ruling-kentucky-clerk-denies-gay-marriage-licences\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">under God’s authority</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” This claim is not only misrepresentative of what religious freedom actually is but also uses the buzzword to discriminate. After Davis was forced by the court to issue marriage licenses, she still refused and later was held in </span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/us/when-businesses-can-deny-you-service-trnd/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contempt of court</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Religion is not an inherently discriminatory idea; however, the usage of religious freedom to masquerade discriminatory practices is a misinterpretation of the First Amendment’s religious protections.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the First Amendment being a part of one of the most well-known pieces of American legislation, its actual meaning and applicable situations have been misconstrued and used as a guise to discriminate. The next time an individual proclaims that they have the religious freedom to discriminate against certain patrons or argues that their free speech is being violated when they are banned from a social media platform, double check if they are actually protected under the First Amendment or if they are just throwing around a buzzword.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justin Tran has the freedom of speech to correct others on their actual First Amendment protections.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92666\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92666\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/the-first-amendment-isnt-a-free-pass-to-discriminate/","id":6459,"author":{"id":794,"name":"Justin Tran"},"related":[6458,6457,6456],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/794"}},"__N_SSG":true}
