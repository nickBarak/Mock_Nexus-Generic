Finance and Business Committee for an upcoming event featuring Ben Shapiro, a political commentator who will present a criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>Shapiro, former editor of conservative news source Breitbart, last <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/fox-contributor-speaks-on-guns-media-at-ucsb/\" target=\"_blank\">spoke at UCSB</a> in 2013. He has previously been banned from speaking engagements at other universities and was escorted off the CSU Los Angeles campus in May 2016 due to protests.</p>\n<p>During the College Republicans’ lengthy presentation, speakers swore more than once and had to field multiple questions from the finance and business committee, including doubts about safety.</p>\n<p>“Our purpose is not to be offensive for the sake of being offensive; that’s childish, and no one wants that,” Andrew Gates, president of College Republicans, told the <em>Nexus</em>. “We believe that offering a different perspective would open a civil dialogue.”</p>\n<p>The group asked for $350 to reserve Corwin Pavilion, $650 for security and $4,000 for Shapiro’s speaker fee.</p>\n<p>The hefty security budget of $650 highlights an underlying risk of violence. Gates has organized similar events in the past and reassured the committee there would be no tolerance for any form of violence.</p>\n<p>“We won’t assault anyone,” he said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Two attendees in support of College Republicans were seated at the front of the room wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, drawing looks of disapproval from other audience members.</p>\n<p>Shapiro has been vocal in his criticism in the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that it lacks values and acts as a source of violence.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, Ben Shapiro has a message, and we agree with that message,” Gates said, “Anyone who thinks he’s irrational or immoral or the worst person ever is free to [say] so at the Q&amp;A portion of the event.”</p>\n<p>“I understand the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement; I understand the reasoning behind the name,” Gates said, but added that he takes issue with how statistics are applied to support assertions of inequality in black communities.</p>\n<p>Gates also said it’s unfair to suggest that white people cannot be subject to racism.</p>\n<p>“It’s sort of a clever way of in academia to get away with saying shitty things about white people,” he said.</p>\n<p>After heated discussion between committee members, finance and business committee chairman Reilly Hobson interjected, reminding everyone that ideology does not influence whether a group should receive funding.</p>\n<p>After an initial objection, followed by a vote with seven members voting to approve funding and four members abstaining, College Republicans were granted the funds.</p>\n<p>They are pursuing additional funding from Young Americans for Liberty as well as other conservative political organizations in the Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p>The funding is pending approval by the A.S. Senate during Wednesday’s meeting at 6:30 p.m. in the Flying A Room of the UCen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73657\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73657\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/a-s-to-fund-college-republicans-event-featuring-ben-shapiro/","id":2707,"author":{"id":109,"name":"Brandon Chen"},"related":[2706,2705,2704],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/109"}},"__N_SSG":true}
