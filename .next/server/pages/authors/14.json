Attorney General Tyler Barth explained in an email to the Senate that due to recent circumstances, it was possible to temporarily waive the requirements.  </span><em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to waive the requirement for the upcoming school year was made in light of uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, according to the resolution’s first author, On-Campus Senator Gurleen Pabla, who spoke during the Wednesday night Associated Students (A.S.) Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are five on-campus senators for the 2020-21 school year: Senator Pabla, Senator Adam Bagul, Senator Anusikha Halder, Senator Dania De Ramon and Senator Taylor Tait, who seconded the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of us are aware how we don’t know how we’re going to move forward with housing and school in general,” Pabla said. “A lot of people are going to have a lot of restrictions moving forward, whether it be housing in general or financial problems.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It might not even apply to some of us senators — but there are others that have constrictions that we should be aware of.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tait added during the meeting that this is a “unique situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Housing is very up in the air. There’s no confirmed statement [from the university.] It’s unfair to expect all of our senators to have on-campus housing when it’s not really up to them how they can live, especially when you factor in social distancing, spreading our dorms and all the [approaches]that housing is going to take for our safety and health,” Tait said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the May University of California Board of Regents meeting, UC President Janet Napolitano </span><a href=\"https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2020/05/uc-regents-fall-2020-budget-coronavirus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the UC system would make a decision regarding the state of Fall Quarter 2020 in mid-June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, Interim Student Health Service Medical Director Ali Javanbakht </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/hybrid-course-schedules-single-dorms-face-masks-for-all-preparing-for-fall-quarter-2020-at-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">told the Nexus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that UCSB is considering offering only singles and doubles in residence halls next year. However, he also said there’s concern among Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s COVID-19 Response Working Group that this could mean a shortage of beds and push more people into I.V. during the school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The on-campus housing requirement — a part of A.S. Legal Code — has long been a subject of debate on the Senate table. Typically, the Senate does not have the power to waive the requirement, as the requirements for senators are in the A.S. Constitution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Attorney General Tyler Barth explained in an email to the Senate that due to recent circumstances, it was possible to temporarily waive the requirements. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The California state government supersedes A.S. Legal Code. Seeing as how this is an unforeseen circumstance, and given that the state is under executive order from the Governor, it is up to the Senate to accommodate and be responsive, as necessary,” Barth said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Senators technically do not have the power to waive those requirements within the confines of our student government, but the state layer of governance is supreme, in this case.

Her vending machine specifically for food insecure students  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a project two years in the making </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be placed in Associated Students (A.S.) Main sometime in the next year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also continued the work of her predecessor Brooke Kopel in finding a permanent location for the A.S. Bike Shop. By the end of her term, Sir narrowed down a final location for the shop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir’s Strategic Vision Task Force met weekly to reassess the Strategic Vision 2020, a project first started by 2013-2014 A.S. President Jonathan Abboud. The project aimed to revamp the way A.S. addresses the larger student body through increased accessibility, outreach and transparency, she said. Throughout her term, Sir helped to create Strategic Vision 2025, a follow up to Abboud’s plan; finalizing this plan will continue with the next A.S. president, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But beyond the tangible projects, Sir said she was most proud of how she advocated for students’ needs with the UC Santa Barbara administration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She pointed to her role in creating UCSB’s first Mental Health Taskforce, which held its first town hall </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/ucsbs-first-mental-town-hall-focuses-on-accessibility-community-engagement/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in early February</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but saw a low turnout of students; her work at the end of winter quarter, when she helped students whose professors refused to cancel in-person finals; and her work at the end of fall, when she said she </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brought students’ concerns</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the sexual assault allegations against members of Sigma Pi to the administration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said she was able to be a resource for students during Fall Quarter 2019, when UCSB fraternities faced several allegations of sexual assault either by members of the fraternity or on fraternity property. Many student leaders and groups criticized administrators for not being transparent about the allegations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said she spoke to several members of the administration about students’ concerns; the administration, in response, created a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-04/task-force-for-safer-social-events-in-i-v-meets-for-second-time-to-hear-updates-about-new-ifc-regulations-university-communications/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safer Social Events in Isla Vista</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> task force to improve safety at social events in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, a member of Greek life herself, emphasized that the task force still has a great deal of work to do in terms of making Isla Vista safer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, when the end of Winter Quarter 2020 hit, Sir said she and her fellow executives compiled testimonials from students’ whose professors had refused to cancel in-person finals, despite the university asking instructors to make alternate arrangements, back when the university initially planned for </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-10/breaking-ucsb-to-transition-to-remote-instruction-beginning-tomorrow-through-end-of-april/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students to return at the end of April</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir said she and the executives then brought those testimonials to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, who allowed them to witness calls he then placed to each professor, “trying to persuade [professors], ‘Hey, this is what students are feeling. This is a testimonial from your class.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she spe</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nt her spring break “constantly calling the Chancellor, the administration and Marisela [Márquez]” to find out what was next for UCSB’s students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following all these conversations, Sir said s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he used an A.S. executive order to launch the A.S. COVID-19 Response Task Force to help centralize all communications and project proposals related to the coronavirus. The task force, chaired by Senate First Pro Tempore Tianna White and Sir’s Chief of Staff Adam Chohan, held its first weekly meeting on May 4. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The task force was able to grant Student Health money for face masks and help students figure out where to request additional grants from A.S. She added that herself and her fellow executives sent out a survey that was later used to create a list of resources specific to different student groups on campus, such as transfer students and undocumented students.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“40% of the job is showing up and being present with what students need in front of the administration,” she said. “I feel like I’ve definitely done that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir’s successor, A.S. President-elect Daevionne Beasley, was sworn in Wednesday night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-17/ucsb-student-says-a-s-president-elect-sexually-assaulted-him-in-2018/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent allegation of sexual assault</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against Beasley, Sir declined to comment, and said the allegation “[is] not part of my term in review.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday, Sir released a statement on her social media accounts and the official Office of the President accounts saying she would be putting her social media accounts “on lockdown </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">due to the extreme harassment I faced on social media for the past week,” an apparent reference to calls for her to address the allegation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will continue to support and serve people after my term, but I will not respond to cyberbullying and intimidation tactics. While I have always been happy to speak with students throughout my term, the way in which I’ve been contacted and the words people have chosen to approach me with are extremely inappropriate,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Izzy Mitchell, a second-year communication and economics double major who created a petition to recall Beasley from office, said she has reached out to Sir both on social media and through messages to Sir herself, according to Mitchell’s social media account, Gauchos4Transparency. Mitchell has been calling for all A.S. senators and executives to release statements regarding the allegation against Beasley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir received backlash from students on social media after putting out her statement, with several pointing to one of her platform points – transparency – as a reason why she should keep them open. Sir declined to comment further about why she put her social media accounts on lockdown. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

current UC Police Department (UCPD) Officer Michael Little and Sergeant Gregory Smorodinsky, both of whom are named in nearly all of the other five lawsuits. Michael Little and his wife, Tiffany Little, filed their own lawsuit against the department in March 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel alleges in her lawsuit that she was sexually harassed by Michael Little, Smorodinsky and an unnamed officer and was later denied a promotion after she refused to enter into a relationship with Smorodinsky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, Siegel worked for the department between June 2015 and August 2019; after reporting several instances of harassment, she resigned after being told by UCPD Chief James Brock that she had become a “target” within the department. Brock took over the department as the interim chief in May 2019 after former UCPD Chief of Police Dustin Olson, who is named in the other lawsuits, left the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The five other lawsuits </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-03/breaking-ucpd-officers-sue-ucpd-members-for-alleged-mistreatment-after-reporting-sergeant/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Little and Tiffany Little v.

Nearly all of the lawsuits allege violations of the California Whistleblower Protection Act, unsafe work practices and a “harassing” environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The attorney representing the Littles, Signa, Reyes and Stern did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the status of the internal mediations. </span></p>\n<p><b>Allegations Against Little: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, after Siegel completed field training in spring 2016, Michael Little allegedly “grabbed Siegel’s lower back/buttocks area, pulled her close and tried to kiss her.” After she pulled away, a separate and unnamed UCPD sergeant then “pushed Plaintiff Siegel against a wall and attempted to kiss her.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late 2017, Siegel allegedly reported to Lieutenant Rob Romero that the Littles were “causing a hostile workplace,” according to the lawsuit. She then brought up her concerns to Lieutenant David Millard, who allegedly told her that a sergeant within the department, Daniel Wilson, had stated that she “was causing issues in the department and needed to be investigated because of her gender and relationships.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the lawsuit states that after Siegel received a promotion to corporal and field training officer in October 2018, Michael Little, who “failed to get a position he applied for,” “became angry and began telling coworkers that Siegel only received her promotion because she was sleeping with a supervisor.”</span></p>\n<p>According to a statement provided by Michael Little’s lawyer, Little “categorically denies each and every allegation.”</p>\n<p><b>Allegations Against Smorodinsky: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the lawsuit, after Siegel applied for a forensic analyst position within the department in August 2018, Smorodinksy “ordered Siegel to come to his home” and “ordered her to leave her cell phone and radio in the car.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He then proceeded to tell her that she was the “top candidate for the forensic analyst position, but that he could not trust her because Siegel would not engage in the kind of personal relationship he wanted,” saying that he “wanted to get married and have babies with Siegel.” She told him that she “would not date” him, according to the lawsuit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit states that a few days later, Smorodinsky called Siegel and told her that “she was not a good fit for the forensic analyst position.” When Siegel reportedly told him that “sometimes relationships do not work out the way we want them to and that’s just how it is,” he responded, “Well, when things don’t go the way you want them to at work, I’ll be sure to remind you that that’s just how it is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel further alleges that she faced discrimination from other officers. In one instance, while responding to a call about an intoxicated person with Wilson and Officer Saray Rubio, Rubio “refused to help” Siegel, stating, “I don’t have to do anything you tell me. You are not a real Corporal.” According to court documents, both Wilson and Rubio have “a close friendship” with Michael Little.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siegel filed two Title IX complaints with the university during 2018 and 2019, but both were rejected, according to the lawsuit. She also reportedly filed sexual harassment complaints with a whistle-blower hotline, the university’s Office of the Ombuds and human resources. She “never received any resolution regarding her complaints,” according to the lawsuit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosanna Vargas, a representative from the attorney’s office representing Siegel, said in an email that Siegel “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hopes to be able to change the culture at the UCSB Police Department for future women in the police department.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ms. Siegel was a devoted police officer for the UCSB Police Department. However, her career was cut short because of the gender bias embedded throughout the police department,” the statement said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Though she complained about the harassment, her complaints were never thoroughly investigated by anyone at the police department or the Regents,” Vargas continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said that the university “cannot comment on pending litigation.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [April 29, 2:22 p.m.]: This article was updated to include a statement from Little’s lawyer. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

That’s not going to happen for us,” said Talia Chalhoub, a biopsychology major who will also be graduating with a certificate in technology management. “The fact that [we] can’t walk into Campbell Hall ever again … You can’t just go sit outside at Cajé anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are people that I’m never going to see again,” she added. “I’m pretending that all this has given us is an extra week at home rather than taking away any time we have remaining.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub, who also has a sister graduating from San Diego State University with the class of 2020, said she hopes to return to I.V. during spring quarter. She pays nearly $1,000 a month to live in I.V., and unlike the thousands of UCSB students who lived on-campus and were given the option to sever their dorm leases, it isn’t as easy to back out for </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vistans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Chalhoub also lives in a house with 13 housemates, which she said can make it difficult to navigate the logistics of online classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know some professors might be recording [lectures] and putting them online, in which case you could just put in your headphones and you’ll be fine anywhere. But other professors are having you log on at 9 a.m. during regular class period,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have a 9 a.m. and [my roommates] have 9 a.m.s and it’s a different class, are we supposed to sit in the same room? How are we supposed to participate if the sound is too loud?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalhoub is one of thousands of UCSB students who are grappling with this unprecedented situation. The university is actively encouraging students to stay away from I.V. if they have already left for their hometowns — warning that the coronavirus can spread quickly in the packed college town — but some seniors are grappling with how to handle their last quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they stay in what has now become a “ghost town,” as put by cultural anthropology major Alex Buckley, or do they return to their hometowns and say goodbye to I.V.?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley, who is immunocompromised and works a full-time job while also taking classes, said she was initially excited when she found out that UCSB was transitioning to remote instruction for spring quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought, okay, this might be a great idea. I’m not going to have to worry about going into class. But then once it actually hit me that I wasn’t going to be able to have an actual, last quarter on campus … it made me really sad,” Buckley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t have any time to say goodbye to anybody. Or even realize that my last day of class, last quarter, was the last class I would ever take on campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buckley said going home would be easier for her than for her peers, because her parents live in Santa Barbara. But her I.V. landlord “already told us that he’s not letting anybody out of their lease.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t have any choice but to stay [in I.V.],” she said. “I would prefer to move and get out of I.V. since there’s nothing here and nothing open anymore.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she considered subletting but hasn’t been able to find anyone actively trying to move into I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people, instead, are trying to get out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Walking around, Isla Vista is such a ghost town,” she said. “It’s really weird and super quiet. There’s no cars on the street, everyone I know has left and it’s a super weird, eerie feeling.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For seniors who have already left for their hometowns, such as for English major Jasmine Garcia, their lives are up in the air — it’s unknown if they will be able to return to I.V. and carry out their senior traditions, or how they will handle remote classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garcia, who transferred to UCSB in Fall Quarter 2018, said this next quarter is going to be difficult for her to manage because she won’t have access to in-person campus resources such as Campus Learning Assistance Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[I have to] become independent and find my own ways to get my essays revised,” she said. “I’m an English major, and [this] makes me feel like I don’t have any other support at the moment.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that it felt like her life “completely froze for a second” when she found out that Spring Quarter 2020 would be conducted remotely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer, this “leaves me with one and a half years [at UCSB],” Garcia said. “I miss interacting with people and finding new connections … that was the number one thing I actually enjoyed the most [at UCSB].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Garcia, UCSB senior Sierra Hastings has also returned to her hometown. But Hastings finds herself in a unique situation for her last quarter; she’s in the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater program, along with nine other people in her senior class — a program that is “a struggle” to teach online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hastings said that her professor has been checking in with her class but noted that they’re “at the same kind of loss, like, ‘Oh my god, how are we going to teach theater and dance on a computer?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s going to be a different quality than what we would get from being in a classroom.

If it does apply, the lease would have to be cancelled in its entirety, meaning all residents would have to vacate, not just the ones who wish to move out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Parents and students] aren’t understanding exactly what they’re reading. Some of it depends on state to state because every state has different laws. This isn’t a federal law. In California, if there’s nothing in your contract that supports, ‘Hey, if there is an act of God situation, then you can excuse yourself from your contract,’ then it doesn’t apply,” Unander said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second term Unander said she has seen used is called a breach of habitability, which can be used if the location is unfit for human occupation or affects the safety of the tenants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Unander said this term also does not apply because the decision to cancel classes, as well as the spread of the virus, “doesn’t make the house uninhabitable,” even if an Isla Vistan is diagnosed with the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The water works, the electricity works, the heating works, the lighting works — assuming there are no problems with the apartment to begin with. But otherwise, the fact that they might be self-quarantining or being quarantined does not make the unit uninhabitable,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may be impossible for residents to break their leases, Unander noted that, depending on the specific lease, tenants can find someone to temporarily or permanently take their places, although Unander emphasized that there is a difference between the two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone is temporarily taking the original tenant’s place — for example, if the original tenant goes abroad or spends the summer away from Santa Barbara — the temporary tenant is considered a subleaser. The subleaser reports to the original tenant and the original tenant reports to the landlord, Unander said; the original tenant is responsible for the actions of the subleaser.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a more permanent situation, where a new tenant takes over the lease completely, the original tenant is “assigning” all of their rights and interests to the person taking their place, meaning the security deposit changes hands and the original tenant will no longer have any relationship with the landlord, Unander explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. residents must check their leases to see what their landlords’ policies are on allowing replacements, Unander said, adding that landlords have the “absolute right” to say that tenants cannot sublease, or that tenants cannot have someone take their places unless they have the landlord’s written consent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If tenants leave and refuse to pay their rent, or if they sublease without the landlord’s prior consent, landlords are well within their rights to pursue legal action against the tenant, Unander warned. </span></p>\n<p>She emphasized in the memo that the decision “to not let you out of your lease is not personal or intended to take advantage of the situation.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Please keep in mind that most landlords have mortgages and bills to pay arising from your apartment, regardless of whether you are currently occupying it. Most or all cannot afford to cancel your lease and absorb loss of rents,” Unander wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may be nearly impossible for I.V. residents to break their leases, UCSB-specific Facebook groups have been flooded with posts from students looking to sublease their rooms for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joana Gutierrez, a third-year history of public policy and feminist studies double major, said she couldn’t justify the cost of rent in I.V. when she had the option to move home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I’m not gonna be here, why am I gonna pay overpriced rent, you know?” she said, adding that she felt like she needed a break from I.V. culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everybody’s super excited about not having classes face-to-face, but that leads to a lot of binge drinking, and it’s stuff that I’m really trying to stay away from for my mental health,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While she hasn’t had luck in finding a subleaser yet, Gutierrez said she has mostly been asking her friends who live in university housing, versus looking for someone on social media. Gutierrez added that her roommate also hadn’t found a subleaser but has already gone home and would continue to pay rent through his financial aid refund check.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people are probably gonna be doing that, and that’s probably what I’m gonna end up doing if I don’t find a subleaser, but financially, it would be better to find someone,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other I.V. residents are planning on staying in Santa Barbara for the duration of the quarter, citing harmful home environments, jobs or other responsibilities in the area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a fifth-year global studies major and Associated Students (A.S.) senator, said he was staying in I.V. to continue working and to avoid a “toxic” home environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While my job is kind of up in the air, whether it will be completely open or how we can get hours, I just don’t have a job back home and that means I won’t be able to make money to pay my rent,” Dumlao said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Additionally, home is just not super healthy,” he said. “The idea of being there for an extended period of time that’s not just a break sounds pretty bad for my mental health.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler Ferguson, a second-year pre-political science major and another A.S. senator, said that in addition to staying because he was “locked into [his] lease,” he wanted to be able to continue carrying out his senatorial duties and supporting other students staying in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson noted that for him, staying in I.V. instead of finding a subleaser — which would require him to pay $500 to his landlord — was the best economic decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m also wanting to get a job out here,” he said. “Being low-income, I definitely need work, and back home there’s not really many jobs available.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Comer, director of SBC Public Health Microbiology Laboratory,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Henning Ansorg, SBC public health officer in the Public Health Department, to elaborate on how the county is responding to the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would like to have everyone tested, but unfortunately, at the moment, we just cannot afford it. I’m looking forward to the next week or 10 days when we have a much better capability [for testing],” Ansorg said. “I urge people to understand that this is not in our hands. Nationwide, there are low shortages of important ingredients in these test kits.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg explained that the county has created a priority tier system for those who need to be currently tested.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Tier 1 are the “most vulnerable,” such as elderly individuals in senior residential facilities and nursing homes, as well as health care workers such as doctors and nurses, whose services are “critical.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tier 2 is composed of severely ill people, cases “where it would make a big difference if they are diagnosed early.” In Tier 3, the lowest category, are people who are “very mildly ill.” Those classified in Tier 3 should isolate themselves until they are fever free for three days, Ansorg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panel members noted they’ve seen a number of questions from community members about how the virus is spread; Batson explained that the coronavirus is transmitted “via droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The coronavirus is] unlike other airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis that don’t weigh as much … Whenever someone coughs, the droplet can typically only go three feet,” Batson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is one of the reasons we are encouraging social distancing because if you stay away from someone who is coughing and the droplet can only go three feet, then it is unlikely you would inhale the infectious droplet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the virus can also be transmitted by touching surfaces, which is why it is important for individuals to continually disinfect surfaces such as doorknobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ansorg said that while currently the county has “more than enough” collection kits to be able to test symptomatic patients, more test kits will be available as “more labs are coming online.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comer clarified that between the Cottage Hospital system and private offices, there are over 1,700 coronavirus testing kits. Van Do-Reynoso said that “to the best of our knowledge, [getting tested] is very affordable because it is free. There is no cost-sharing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you feel like you’re coming down with a sore throat, nasal congestion, a cough, a fever, please consider yourself a potential case. I don’t mean this in order to make people afraid, but take this seriously,” Ansong said. “Do not go to work. Do not mingle with people. Stay isolated and take care of yourself.” </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [March 17, 2:56 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Yang. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students who are planning to leave campus will receive the same education as those who stay and will not be disadvantaged for remaining away,” Yang said in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the university is “continuing to work out issues related to work-study, financial aid, housing, and dining so that none of our students are disadvantaged by these changes.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang also said in the email that the deadline to submit winter grades has been extended by one week to March 31 in order to accommodate professors switching final exams from in-person to online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that the decision to move classes online was not made lightly and was “d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">riven by our responsibility to protect the health and well-being of our students and their families, as well as that of our dedicated staff and faculty.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if a young adult gets a mild form of the disease, it can be transmitted to parents or grandparents or others in the community in whom the disease can be deadly,” Yang said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While several large gatherings in the area have been cancelled for the next month, Armistead and Klawunn said that, for now, commencement ceremonies will continue as planned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do not know yet how COVID-19 transmission will progress and will keep you updated if anything changes regarding commencement.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

They will continue to strike until their demands are met, according to a statement posted to the movement’s Twitter account. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA movements on other campuses are planning a one-day, full work stoppage “blackout” strike on Thursday, March 5, in solidarity with the dismissed UCSC graduate students. At each campus, COLA movements are urging faculty to cancel all classes and undergraduate students to walk out of any classes that professors didn’t cancel. Organizers are also asking participants to wear all black. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is an ever growing number of students who are ready to strike and who are prepared to strike,” Zak Fisher, UC Los Angeles’ Graduate Student Association president, told the Nexus. Fisher attributed this sentiment not only to the COLA movement at UCLA but also to the firing of the UCSC graduate students, noting that participation in COLA organizing has “increased exponentially.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA graduate students voted Monday evening to join the Thursday “blackout” strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are just fed up … the [UCSC] firings brought a lot of attention from people who weren’t really paying attention before,” he said, adding that hundreds of people have attended  UCLA COLA rallies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher, as GSA president, said he presented the UCLA COLA demands to UCLA Chancellor Gene Block on Feb. 21. But beyond that, he said he hasn’t seen much of a response from the chancellor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why is it that it’s the ‘number one public university,’ in the country, [and] the leader of the university won’t come out and publicly address concerns?” Fisher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to at Davis, UC San Diego organizers are leaning more toward a grading strike rather than a full strike, according to Syed Muhammad Abbas Yousuf, an ethnic studies doctoral student, and Avaneesh Narla, a physics doctoral student. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that a recent UCSD COLA movement vote showed that around 200 graduate students were willing to strike in some capacity, although there is a “strong leaning toward holding a grading strike rather than a full strike.” </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think people are just fed up.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Week Nine, UCSD graduate students scheduled a number of events aimed at educating undergraduates about the movement and gaining support across campus for the movement; they will be joining the “blackout” strike by holding a walkout around 1:30 p.m. on Thursday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley graduate students also voted to join the one-day “blackout” strike, according to Tara Phillips, a UCB COLA organizer. UCB’s strike will last from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Sproul Plaza in the center of campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCB COLA movement also voted Tuesday to create a departmental organizing structure and will begin asking different departments to hold meetings to discuss and vote on strike-readiness, according to a resolution passed by the movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once we’ve reached 10 strike-ready departments, we will call a General Assembly to vote on strike escalation on our campus,” an email sent to supporters of the UCB COLA movement said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Riverside, graduate students plan to join the UC-wide “blackout” strike with a rally at 11:45 a.m., according to the movement’s Twitter account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has also released a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyviszddmLXQBJLzQkF7FesG53qcQWrZ0BetfINuBtmzk78A/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the UCR community, asking students to stand in solidarity with the UCSC strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While graduates at some campuses are taking steps toward a vote to strike, others, such as UC Irvine, haven’t decided to go on a full strike but are still organizing for a COLA in other ways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI COLA organizers Nalya Rodriguez, a sociology doctoral student, and Courtney Echols, a criminology law and society doctoral student, said that UCI COLA organizing began on Feb. 20, when over 200 UCI graduate students and supporters rallied in solidarity with the UCSC strikers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, UCI put the administration building Aldrich Hall on lockdown. During the rally, campus police </span><a href=\"https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/02/29/uci-alumna-arrested-by-ucipd-during-cost-of-living-adjustment-rally-for-uc-santa-cruz-graduate-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested UCI alumni </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shikera Chamndany</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after she entered the building while attempting to obtain her transcripts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chamndany, who was reportedly not involved with the COLA movement or participating in the rally, was “handcuffed and tackled,” the New University reported. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The arrest drew backlash both on campus and across the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We firmly believe that this [is] indicative of the anti-Blackness that pervades not just UC Irvine, but the UC system as a whole,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Echols said. She said that the following day, the university put out a campus-wide statement “trying to illustrate that they cared about UCI graduate students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But we know that if they actually cared, they would immediately send these issues of unfair wages and unjust housing costs which disproportionately affect Black and brown students,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCI COLA movement held a sick-out on Monday and Tuesday, during which graduate students called in sick and did not show up to work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The average Irvine graduate student spends 43% of their income on rent, and some students report spending as much as 90% of their income on rent here in Irvine,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with a COLA, UCI graduate students are d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emanding that the officer who arrested Chamndany, Sgt.

We’re especially cognizant that the time to act is now, the time to be proactive is now, because we have a chance to stop this in our own city and prevent further rent burden and further rent hikes before it gets as dramatically bad as it has gotten in the other campuses.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diep said that UAW 2865 leadership, along with general members, met with UCM Chancellor Nathan Brostrom on March 2 to </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kWBMnJQHG5tgoC2JGAN3kUUHBlaZHxcm-QVkCCLlKXg/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discuss graduate student struggles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and that they plan to meet sometime next week for a follow-up meeting. Diep emphasized that the discussion focused on broader needs and did not focus on the specific TA contract currently in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been no formal UC-wide response to the COLA movements to date; organizers across the UC system emphasized that negotiations need to happen through UCOP instead of at individual universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents filed an Unfair Practices Charge against UAW 2865 on Feb. 24, alleging that the union has failed to take action to end strikes at UCSC. In response, UAW 2865 filed two separate Unfair Practice Charges against the UC; the UAW 2865 bargaining unit also voted on March 3 to hold a union-wide vote whether to go on strike due to unfair labor practices. All union members will vote on this in April. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

On Dec. 9, hundreds of graduate students went on a wildcat strike, meaning the strike is not authorized by their union. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduate students, as part of their strike, refused to release over 12,000 undergraduate grades by the submission deadline of Dec. 18 until the university agreed to a COLA of $1,412 a month to supplement their current TA salaries. The university refused, and this past Monday, UCSC graduate students began an indefinite full wildcat strike, meaning a strike without the authorization of their union, UC Student-Workers Union (UAW Local 2865). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the root of the UC COLA movements is the concept of rent burden, defined as spending more than 30% of one’s wages on rent, according to the UCSC COLA website. Students’ rent burdens vary from campus to campus, but across the UC, organizers have been using rent burden to calculate COLAs specific to their respective universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While only the UCSC COLA movement has officially gone on strike, several other UCs, such as UCSB and UCSD, have now drafted and presented demands to leadership at their respective universities. At other UCs, such as UC Los Angeles, UC Berkeley and UC Davis, COLA movements are in their infancy, but are growing fast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus spoke with organizers at various UC campuses to document their COLA movements and the stages each movement is in. </span></p>\n<p>Further coverage of UCSB’s COLA movement can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>UC Santa Cruz:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students finished their third day on strike on Wednesday; throughout the day, hundreds of graduate students linked arms and blocked the intersection at the base of UCSC’s campus, facing off against a blockade of police officers and disrupting bus services. At least 16 people were arrested and given citations, City on a Hill Press reported, but as of 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, only one remained in custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a press release sent out by the UCSC COLA movement, at</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> least one student allegedly “had her finger broken by police, another was bleeding profusely from his head after being hit by batons, and others received bruised ribs and bones.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jane Komori, a doctoral student within the history of consciousness department and co-secretary of the UCSC Graduate Student Association, explained that at UCSC, the demand for a COLA officially began in November, when graduate students presented their demands to the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Santa Cruz students pay 50, 60, 70% of their wages of rent per month, which makes it next to impossible to afford most other things, especially if you have medical copays or childcare or any kind of emergency,” Komori said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, UCSC graduate students are on an indefinite strike; those who are a part of the COLA movement are not holding office hours and sections and will not release undergraduate students’ fall quarter and upcoming winter quarter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said that last week, UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive offered new programs for graduate students that would help offset the cost of living, such as one that offers five years of funding at their current pay rate, and another than would provide a $2,500 a year housing supplement or fellowship for those in need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Komori called the offers “insufficient,” and said that showed, to her, that the university “doesn’t take our demands seriously at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the last she heard, administration would be starting “disciplinary action against the strike.” Several graduate students posted to social media about receiving disciplinary hearing summons and formal warning letters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Monday, upwards of 1,500 UCSC undergraduate students have also signed a petition in support of their graduate students, Komori said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Komori said the university is now refusing to meet with the striking graduate students now that they are “carrying out an unsanctioned strike.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been updating through the Twitter account </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@payusmoreucsc and on the website payusmoreucsc.com. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon said the strike at UCSC is “illegal” and that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC San Diego: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC San Diego’s COLA movement began last year, when the university’s Housing, Dining and Hospitality Unit — the equivalent of UCSB’s Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises — planned to increase graduate students’ rents for on-campus apartments, according to Celine Khoury, a doctoral student in literature and recording secretary within the San Diego chapter of United Automobile Workers (UAW) Local 2865, the UC-wide union representing graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students held a housing march to protest the plan, but the unit raised the price of rent regardless. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was out of this momentum that the UCSD COLA movement formed, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our [graduate students] make up 15% of our workforce,” Khoury said. “UCSD has the largest number of academic employees out of all of the UCs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a UCSD COLA fact sheet posted to the movement’s Twitter account, graduate teaching assistants made $2,434 a month, and a majority of them paid over 42% of their monthly wages in rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Khoury described the UCSD COLA moment as very “grassroots” and “collaborative,” explaining that there are a number of members of the UCSD COLA movement that are also involved with the UCSD Graduate Student Association (GSA) and the campus union, UAW 2865. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this week, the UCSD GSA unanimously passed a resolution that supported both the striking UCSC workers as well as any future action taken by graduate students at UC San Diego, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, approximately 80 members of the UCSD COLA movement, alongside a few campus groups and undergraduates, held a “peaceful march” across campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group made its way to UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla’s office, where they planned on delivering their demands, which include providing all student workers with housing stipends that translate to between $1,400 and $3,100 a month; lowering rent on all existing on-campus housing; and building affordable on-campus housing for the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Khosla didn’t open the door, Khoury said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, organizers “chanted the letter” and, before they left, “taped all of our signs to the chancellor’s door and the [outside] walls of his office.” Now, they are waiting for the chancellor to respond to their demands. The UCSD COLA movement also held a public forum Wednesday night, open to all students and faculty, to provide updates on the UC-wide COLA rallies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ColaUcsd. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Davis: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Rich, a doctoral student in English at UC Davis, said the UCD COLA movement began in December, in solidarity with the UCSC COLA movement. Several other UC COLA movements also held rallies in solidarity with UCSC on the same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our initial purpose was to just try and support them, but we pretty quickly, like a lot of other campuses, were realizing that we have a lot of similar problems that Santa Cruz is having … so we used that first event as a jumping off point.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rich said the movement is currently composed of a smaller group of graduate students rather than an entire organization. They plan to attend their UCD GSA meeting and talk to the local union members about how to broaden the movement, Rich said, and they’re also starting to reach out to undergraduates as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Rich is hoping they can draft a list of demands that also would help with equity between departments or guaranteed summer funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few members of the UCD COLA movement also travelled to UC Santa Cruz to support the strikers; according to the @ucd4cola Twitter account, one of the UCD COLA organizers was among those arrested during the Wednesday UCSC COLA strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting online under the Twitter account @ucd4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Berkeley: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tara Phillips, UAW 2865 and UC Berkeley COLA organizer, said the COLA movement at UC Berkeley is “still in its infancy,” noting that it was difficult to get a COLA movement off the ground because the campus union wasn’t supportive of the movement “until recently.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement’s first action was in December, she said, when around 70 people held a solidarity rally for UCSC strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] talked about how difficult it is to get by here, how precarious the lives of grad students are because pay is so low and rent is so high,” Phillips said. “Folks were talking about landlord abuse and the inability to pay for medical treatment, loans that folks need to take out just to supplement their income … [but] also how much we love teaching, and that we wish the university valued it more.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phillips said that while most graduate students pay 50% or more of their wages on rent, that payment only lasts for 10 months of the year — nine months for the UC campuses on the quarter system — and most students “have to scramble over the summer to get rent money together, because teaching is not guaranteed in the summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re living very stressful, financially precarious lives for a long time,” she said, adding that she believes the university has done a “very poor job” in terms of equity across the various UC Berkeley departments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly – the equivalent of UCSB’s GSA – and UAW 2863 passed a resolution in support of the UCSC strike last week, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, Phillips said the movement is “just starting to map out what the future looks like for us, and how to keep building that movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re sort of in this educational phase … but ideally we’d like to be able to turn out a lot of graduate students to a general assembly, and discuss collectively what we want, what our demands look like, and how to pressure the administration to give us a COLA.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that UAW 2865 came up with a projected COLA for UC Berkeley to bring students out of rent burden — $2,103, the highest number so far across the UCs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting on the Facebook page “Cal COLA: Pay Us More UCB.” </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Los Angeles: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA GSA President Zak Fisher, who attends UCLA School of Law, explained that after UCSC students went on strike, the conversation of a UCLA COLA became a “hot topic of conversation.” He noted, however, that there is “no official club” for a UCLA COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen this campus today engaging this important question of, ‘How do we fight for a cost-of-living adjustment or for cost-of-living issues more generally?’ I haven’t met a graduate student yet who said, ‘No way, we get paid enough, what are you doing?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fisher said that he ran for GSA president on a platform of creating a cost-of-living adjustment for graduate students, among other issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, graduate students are spreading a survey around in hopes of getting a better idea of how rent-burdened students are, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As GSA president, Fisher said he has spoken to administrators about the issues that he ran on, but “they’ll give you lip service all day, saying ‘Hey, these are important issues,’ but then you’ll meet with them three months later and say, ‘Oh, what have you done? Absolutely nothing.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that he’s seen support from UCLA undergraduate students as well, noting that the undergraduate student government and the GSA unanimously passed a resolution in support for UCSC strikers, demanding that there be no retaliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone is starting to realize, this is our collective fight and our collective struggle.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The movement has been posting under the Twitter handle @ucla4cola. </span></p>\n<p><b>UC Riverside: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB COLA Outreach Committee member Adam Parison confirmed that a “pretty small” COLA movement was beginning at UC Riverside, but that the movement has no social media platforms yet, and Parison could not provide contact information for any COLA organizers at UCR.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
