When the little lost lady admitted that she did not know of any to call, the officers asked if she at least knew the address she was trying to find.<br>\n“Why would I know the address by heart?” she asked.<br>\nShe went on to say she was with some friends earlier in the night, but was separated due to a power outage — falling trees are such a buzzkill.<br>\n“How could I see anybody?” she asked in all seriousness.<br>\nThe officers were no longer feeling sorry for this dunce and asked her to recite the alphabet.

The man responded three times with the same string of numbers and no street address. When asked how much he had to drink, he responded he had 16 shots that night, which he said was more than he typically consumes.<br>\nEventually, the officers also had to ask where his pants were. The Undie King had no idea, but said he was a tad cold.<br>\nOfficers arrested the man and transported him to Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, sans pants, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-04/police-blotter-68/","id":3815,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3814,3813,3812],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Feb. 12, 1:41 a.m. — Officers came across a man screaming, “Fuck the free world!” on the corner of Embarcadero del Mar and Seville Road.

The deputies watched in a daze, wondering if they had been teleported back to a ’60s anti-realism brigade, as three cars did their best to maneuver around the individual. Suddenly, the wild man dropped his trousers, flashing the drivers as he laughed and continued yelling. The officers approached and tried not to look at his flaccid free willy swinging about. The cops struggled to sit the manic man down, catching him as he nearly face-planted in the middle of the street. Once seated, the individual explained that hewas merely a film studies major searching  for inspiration for a new movie.<br>\nThis  guy  clearly  had  not  checked  his  calendar to remind himself that today was  “no  one  gives  a  shit  about  your  ridiculous  ideas” day.<br>\nThe man continued to say he was from  out  of  town  and  not  familiar  with  I.V.,  as  if  that  was  a  legitimate  excuse  to  drop  his  pants in the middle of a busy intersection.

The  out-of-towner  kept  saying  his  address  was  “Costa  Mesa”  and  that  he  went to “OCC” community college, which  told  the  officers  this  guy  clearly  did  not  know Isla Vista.<br>\nOfficers  then  asked  the  community  college champion to recite the alphabet.

He interviewed hundreds for his 2008 book “Permanence: Tattoo Portraits” in search of what inspires people to embody their stories in ink.</p>\n<p>“My work has always been about identity,” Fulbeck said. “I’m not interested in the actual tattoo. I’m more interested in why they do what they do.”<br>\nIn all of his travels, Fulbeck said the only constant has been that everyone has their own different reasons for getting inked.</p>\n<p>J.J. Ortiz, one of the owners of downtown Santa Barbara’s 805 Ink, discovered his love for the art at a young age when he saw some older men tattooing in a backyard.<br>\nHe was hooked. The sound of the needles, the time spent with his neighborhood friends and the chance to be creative were addicting.</p>\n<p>“[Tattooing] didn’t look that hard,”  Ortiz said with a laugh. “I did my first tattoo on this girl in junior high. She wanted a “J” for this guy she liked, and they actually ended up getting married. It wasn’t good at all, but that was the beginning.”</p>\n<p>[media-credit id=20169 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"969699489\" data-slb-group=\"33472\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/cbf_16feb2011_tattoofeature-007/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?fit=2700%2C780&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2700,780\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1297743431\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature 007\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?fit=250%2C72&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?fit=888%2C257&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007-250x72.jpg?resize=250%2C72\" alt=\"\" title=\"cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature 007\" width=\"250\" height=\"72\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33476\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?resize=250%2C72&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?resize=1024%2C296&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cbf_16FEB2011_tattoofeature-007.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]Ortiz graduated high school, breezed through SBCC with straight A’s, received his bachelor’s degree and was set to be a teacher. But the itch to ink was persistent and soon he started working as an apprentice.</p>\n<p>“It’s constantly a learning process,” Jay said. “Every day is learning. Every tattoo counts.”</p>\n<p><em>And each person involved in the process counts. Every artist has a different forte; every customer a different vision.</em></p>\n<p>In his travels, Fulbeck said he noticed that some tattoos show obvious evidence of foresight while some seem more spur-of-the-moment. Some, like Amy Romeo, a second-year biopsychology major, incorporate their own designs and enduring life experiences into their work — as opposed to the much teased ‘tramp stamp’ effect.<br>\nRomeo creates her own artwork and recently started tattooing her friends. She illustrated the tattoo on her back, which pictures her ribcage as if layers of skin had been peeled back with a zipper, before it was inked by a tattoo artist.</p>\n<p>“[The drawing] was originally for my concentration portfolio in high school for my AP art class,” Romeo said. “We had to come up with a theme and a lot of my artwork ended up coming out with anatomy. I’ve always liked human anatomy; I find it fascinating.”</p>\n<p>These different ‘schools of tattooing,’ Fulbeck said, were evident across the globe.</p>\n<p>“There are those who get tattoos without putting much thought into what they want,” Fulbeck said. “Some people end up liking them, and some don’t. [The tattoos serve] as a scar on your body, kind of showing who you were at that time. It’s like a historical roadmap. Then there is the second school of people who wait and wait and wait and do their research, get to know different artists and then get the tattoo.”</p>\n<p>In Japan, he met several artists who emphasized the importance of the relationship between the tattoo artist and the tattooee. Fulbeck met Horitaka — now a close friend and the author of the foreword to “Permanence” — who introduced him to Horiyoshi III, the most renowned Japanese tattoo artist alive. In fact, Horiyoshi III gave Fulbeck a tattoo.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”PHOTO COURTESY OF Nicole Rogers” align=”alignleft” width=”199″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1219229395\" data-slb-group=\"33472\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33478\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/nicole/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg?fit=1008%2C1263&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1008,1263\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPhone\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1249075440\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"nicole\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg?fit=200%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole.jpg?fit=817%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/nicole-199x250.jpg?resize=199%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"nicole\" width=\"199\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33478\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]“I think, especially in Japanese style, you have to have a relationship with the artist — you really have to synchronize,” Fulbeck said. “There is a tremendous amount of trust involved. I have an original piece of art on my back that burns with me after I die. I’m always indebted to Horiyoshi III for the work he did.”<br>\nWhen he came back from Japan, Fulbeck said, the prevalence of tattoo shops in the U.S. seemed to show a slightly more pop-culture tinge to American ink.<br>\nNonetheless, hordes of tattoo artists treat their craft with a seriousness matching the permanency of their art.<br>\nPat Fish of Santa Barbara-based LuckyFish Tattoo, a specialist in Celtic art, says she invests her time heavily into each tattoo assignment to connect on an individual level with each client.</p>\n<p>“I do a lot of research and find out what’s really meaningful to you,” Fish said. “Say you wanted a bird. If it came to it, I would go to the Natural History Museum to find the exact bird you wanted.”</p>\n<p>According to Fish, the majority of her clientele has been with her for 26 years, and respects her mastery of the tattoo so much that individuals will fly out from various parts of the world to get a new tat.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to do an art form that was a craft, and had immediate connection with the client,” Fish said. “No art gallery, no publisher, just me and the person for whom I was creating the art. I saw tattoos as having an ineluctable savor, providing a sign more permanent than almost anything else in life.”</p>\n<p>Fish said she takes the tattoo process seriously because of her personal values.</p>\n<p>“I’m really moral,” Fish said. “I believe I’m responsible for what I do in this life. If I’m putting a piece of art on [someone’s] back, it’s got to be good — I can’t have that bad karma. I do the best I can to be the agent of completion — people come to me with an idea, and I complete it.”</p>\n<p><em>The great thing about tattoos is that each one has its own flavor — a personalized blend of artist and recipient. Sometimes, a third party inspires or draws a tattoo before it is even taken to the artist to be inked.  Also the musculature of every human body varies enough that each tattoo is unlikely to ever be repeated.</em></p>\n<p>“The canvas is constantly moving,” Fulbeck said.</p>\n<p>Ali Obsorne, a second-year environmental studies major, said her tattoo placement was inspired by the nature of her design.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”PHOTO COURTESY OF Sonni Johnson” align=”alignleft” width=”152″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2043953081\" data-slb-group=\"33472\"><img data-attachment-id=\"33480\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/sonni2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?fit=847%2C1390&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"847,1390\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"sonni2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?fit=152%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?fit=624%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2-152x250.jpg?resize=152%2C250\" alt=\"\" title=\"sonni2\" width=\"152\" height=\"250\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33480\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?resize=152%2C250&amp;ssl=1 152w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?resize=624%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sonni2.jpg?w=847&amp;ssl=1 847w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]“It’s a redwood leaf and I got it to symbolize where I grew up, which is Humboldt County, and we are famous for our redwood trees,” Osborne said. “I got it on my shoulder because I wanted it to look like it fell on my shoulder.

Ally Miller, a third-year black studies major and education and LGBTQ studies minor, said her ink is an admonition to find the simple pleasures in life.</p>\n<p>“In high school … our teacher assigned us a project called ‘Carpe Diem,’” Miller said. “It was really meaningful to me; I was going through a lot at the time. I clung to the project as the one thing that really kept me going — that I woke up excited about in the morning. When I got to college, I wanted a symbol to remind myself about everything I was going through and how amazing the projects made me feel.”</p>\n<p>Some, like fourth-year communication major Angela Chandra who has an Ohm symbol on her side, see tattoos as a form of spiritual expression.</p>\n<p>“The symbol itself stands for truth love and divinity, and the balance between the awakened state and the dream state and it also captures the sound of the universe,” she said. “I knew I wanted one for a really long time.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33472\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33472\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-16/love-affair-ink/","id":3523,"author":{"id":262,"name":"Madison Medeiros"},"related":[3522,3521,3520],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"While strolling by Anisq’ Oyo’ Park, an Isla Vista Foot Patrol officer noticed a particularly intoxicated individual stumbling about with a white paper bag in hand.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>Shocking, but True…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Saturday, January 22, 2:15 a.m. —</strong> While strolling by Anisq’ Oyo’ Park, an Isla Vista Foot Patrol officer noticed a particularly intoxicated individual stumbling about with a white paper bag in hand.</p>\n<p>Upon being approached, the man hastily turned in the opposite direction, threw his bag of uneaten food on the ground and bolted.</p>\n<p>The eco-friendly officer, outraged at the apparent environmental apathy, called after the dumping drunk to pick up his trash.
