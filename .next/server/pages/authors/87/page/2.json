OSL examines an organization’s overall success and university outreach to determine a winner every year.</p>\n<p>The AISA was recognized for creating new visibility and membership for Native American students and greater recognition to the Chumash bands living in the area.</p>\n<p>AISA was founded in 1970 by UCSB alumnus and Pawnee Native American Lawrence Baca, who in 2012 won the American Bar Association’s Thurgood Marshall award for his work in defending civil rights.</p>\n<p>The AISA is a place for students to learn and share each other’s traditions and tribal customs and emphasize the importance of recognizing and honoring the Coastal Band of Chumash Nation, whose land the campus is located on, said Keri Bradford, a graduate student and American Indian Student Services Coordinator.</p>\n<p>“[The Coastal Band of Chumash] have welcomed us to their land and into their homes,” Bradford said in an email. “[They] continue to bless us with songs, wisdom, hugs and laughter.”</p>\n<p>Bradford also said their local community “is made up of members from so many different Tribes and Nations” similar to the bonds created in AISA.</p>\n<p>She said the Native community takes care of the UCSB AISA members while they are on Native land and said their family “just keeps growing.”</p>\n<p>Bradford told the <em>Nexus</em> in an email that she nominated AISA for their exceptional work in expanding their outreach program.</p>\n<p>AISA organized Students Taking Action for Native Dreams of Success (S.T.A.N.D.S.), a three-day college immersion conference on campus for Native American junior high and high school students.</p>\n<p>S.T.A.N.D.S. hosted students from 17 different Tribes and 22 schools that UCSB has historically not reached out to, and AISA members continue to mentor them, Bradford said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78403\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78403\" data-attachment-id=\"78403\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/aisa-at-stands-with-scholars/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AISA-at-STANDS-with-Scholars.jpg?fit=2048%2C1275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AISA at STANDS with Scholars\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AISA-at-STANDS-with-Scholars.jpg?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AISA-at-STANDS-with-Scholars.jpg?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78403 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AISA-at-STANDS-with-Scholars-1024x638.jpg?resize=888%2C553\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AISA-at-STANDS-with-Scholars.jpg?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AISA-at-STANDS-with-Scholars.jpg?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AISA-at-STANDS-with-Scholars.jpg?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AISA-at-STANDS-with-Scholars.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AISA-at-STANDS-with-Scholars.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78403\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AISA organized Students Taking Action for Native Dreams of Success (S.T.A.N.D.S.), a three-day college immersion conference on campus for Native American junior high and high school students. <em>Courtesy of AISA</em></p></div>\n<p>“I learned more about my Native Heritage and what UCSB has to offer,” said Desirae, a tenth-grade S.T.A.N.D.S. participant, in a statement on AISA’s website. “I’m really thankful I was able to attend STANDS and have this experience. I am truly grateful for all of the opportunities coming my way.”</p>\n<p>The conference was free for the participants and their families thanks to AISA members raising the necessary funds.</p>\n<p>Bradford said their funding comes from “several partners across campus,” including the Chancellor’s and Vice Chancellor’s office, several academic and student affairs departments and A.S. organizations including Community Affairs Board, Student Commission on Racial Equality and Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee.</p>\n<p>Their main source of funding is the Student-Initiated Outreach Program (SIOP), Bradford said. They also receive donations from various partners on and off campus.</p>\n<p>According to the 2016-17 UCSB Campus Profile, Native American students make up 1 percent of the graduate and undergraduate student population, and Bradford said there are currently about 240 self-identified Native American graduate and undergraduate students enrolled at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“This means that these students self-identified on their applications when they were applying to UCSB,” Bradford said.</p>\n<p>She also said, however, that there is no accurate way to identify the actual percentage of Native American students on campus because some students may be multiracial or multiethnic and choose to identify with other demographics when applying.</p>\n<p>Some students, she said, do not disclose their race or ethnicity because it is not required.</p>\n<p>“Some of our AISA members chose not to identify on the application … but of all the UC schools, we enroll the greatest number of self-identified American Indians,” Bradford said.</p>\n<p>Bradford said the organization tabled at the S.T.E.M. Student Welcome day last year where members talked about Indigenous science and ways of taking action on campus in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline through fundraisers, honorings and activism.</p>\n<p>The group experienced record-high membership during the 2016-17 school year and attended a dinner with Student Affairs Staff to discuss Native American experiences in April.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer, a first-year global and feminist studies double major of Arawak heritage, said it is comforting “to know that you’re not alone” as a Native American student.</p>\n<p>Meijer said everyone in the group is “incredibly welcoming,” and she hopes to become more involved throughout the rest of her undergraduate years.</p>\n<p>Meijer said it is difficult to mobilize more students because of the lack of Native American visibility and hopes to create more opportunities for Native American students as a newly elected Assembly District Delegate for the California Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>“In America there are things that Native Americans go through and face that other people don’t necessarily recognize or think about,” Meijer said. “When you get into a group with other Native American students that realize this, it is very unifying because shared experiences and thoughts allow us to connect.”</p>\n<p>K’Ehleyr McNulty, an AISA member who will soon be graduating with degree in earth science, said AISA is the one place she can feel “worthy” of her own experiences and opinions.</p>\n<p>An Arizona native, McNulty said the organization has become an extension of her home and her Ohlone Costanoan Esselen Native American Nation during her time at UCSB. She said it has become a place where Native American students can find commonalities with one another in their heritage.</p>\n<p>She said she hopes the group will grow in the following years after she graduates in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“It is the one place I can feel myself the most on this campus,” McNulty said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78411\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78411\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/american-indian-student-association-wins-osl-group-of-the-year/","id":2357,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2356,2355,2354],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza, a UC San Diego alum, last came to UCSB nearly 10 years ago when she worked for the University of California Student Association.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting the tone for an intersectional conversation about social justice, Garza welcomed the full auditorium by asking the audience to acknowledge that they were standing on land once occupied by Chumash indigenous people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then expressed her support for the list of demands from the Black Student Union, Black Student Engagement program and Black Resource Committee, which includes ensuring that black students make up more than 5 percent of the university’s student population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also supported the idea to hire two full-time black psychologists on campus and spoke of the psychological effects of controversial speakers invited to the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Emotional wellness is important for everybody, not just black students,” she said, “but certainly in a campus environment, where I hear there was just a speaker here talking about the lies and division of Black Lives Matter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Shapiro spoke at Campbell Hall in February for his event titled “Lies, Prejudice, and Division: The Legacy of the #BLM Movement,” which was later named “The Regressive Left, ‘Social Justice’ and #BlackLivesMatter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said narratives of history impact our present and future. She said “this country is powered by the engine of amnesia” because historical aspects are often “conveniently” left out in conversation about BLM.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza went on to say that the nation has a history of racially prejudiced “laws, policies and practices,” which she said are “deliberately designed to rob some of power in favor of giving others power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted that of the “two million people locked up … one million of those people” are African American. She said they are not incarcerated because they are “inherently criminal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is not liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican; this is just what is,” she said. “It’s because there are laws that disproportionately target black people for things that all people do, but not all people get put in cages for their lives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This July will mark the four-year anniversary of BLM, and Garza said she wanted to make it clear that it is not just a movement for black lives, “but a movement to save all of our lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said there are misunderstandings of the movement that distract from its message.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Black Lives Matter started as a love note to black people, but it is a demand and a call to action,” Garza said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77388\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77388\" data-attachment-id=\"77388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-02/black-lives-matter-co-founder-debunks-blm-myths-at-campbell-hall/alicia-garza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,512\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alicia Garza-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?fit=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-77388\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alicia-Garza-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said this movement began in generations prior to hers and is now a continuation of a long legacy of struggle in the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also outlined three “myths” of BLM: the notions that it is anti-police, anti-white and black supremacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said the movement is not anti-police, but, rather, it is against the perpetuation of cycles of violence. She said she believes the cycle will end when someone is courageous enough to say that the institutions and systems in place “are not working.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza also said the allegation that BLM is a black supremacy group “just doesn’t make sense.” The activist group does not want to perpetuate the same systems that oppress people but, rather, to transform the powers that operate those systems, Garza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Dolan, associate director at the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity and one of the organizers for the event, said BLM week is about “coalition building.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolan said they believe the event was an effective way to bring people together and “center the Black Lives Matter movement on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fabiola Pérez, a fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she thought Garza made “all these issues human” and spoke about them in realistic terms.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like a lot of the stuff we see is so out there and it feels so far away, when in reality it’s very immediate and very close,” Pérez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garza said she wanted the audience to leave thinking about “the ways we want to create movement and the ways we establish power.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the U.S. needs “really courageous white people” to realize white supremacy does exist, adding that economic struggles are national concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “White folks need this movement,” she said. “They’re being fed a lie, too.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The week’s events aim to address the nature of institutionalized racism and its effect on society.</p>\n<p>Garza, current special projects director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, will share her call-to-action against discrimination in the U.S. and urge individuals to join the fight for justice for all black lives.</p>\n<p>Garza will also be featured in a sustainability workshop at 12 p.m. Wednesday in the Associated Students (A.S.) Pardall Center to discuss student activism, strategizing and movement.</p>\n<p>The BLM movement started in 2012 after 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was posthumously put on trial for his own murder and the shooter, George Zimmerman, was acquitted of the murder charges.</p>\n<p>Martin’s death and Zimmerman’s acquisition sparked outrage across the country. Racial tension became the center of protests much like those in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 after Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by then police officer Darren Wilson.</p>\n<p>These cases prompted grassroots community organizing like BLM in response to the rising number of police shootings across the country.</p>\n<p>The internet responded to the growing tensions with #BlackLivesMatter.</p>\n<p>Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors and Garza, the BLM founders, transformed the viral hashtag into a movement that is now a chapter-based national organization working for the validity of black life.</p>\n<p>According to their website, BLM strives to broaden the conversation around state violence to include all of the ways in which black people are intentionally left powerless at the hands of the state.</p>\n<p>“It was a response to the anti-Black racism that permeates our society and also, unfortunately, our movements,” wrote Garza in the “herstory” section of their website.</p>\n<p>Critics of the movement visited UCSB earlier this year and stirred controversy over free speech.</p>\n<p>Ben Shapiro, conservative political commentator and author, visited Campbell Hall in February for an event titled “The Regressive Left, ‘Social Justice’ and #BlackLivesMatter.” The lecture was previously entitled “Lies, Prejudice and Division: The Legacy of the #BLM Movement.”</p>\n<p>The event was preempted by a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-senate-approves-funding-for-ben-shapiro-event-after-six-hour-meeting/\">six-hour-long A.S.

Here are highlights for answers to questions from the moderator, Mary Zhu:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>CONNECTIONS:</b> Zhu asked the candidates if they have sustainable statewide networks to work with as EVPSA. Hsu cited her past three years of experience in A.S., specifically her involvement in the UCSB Federal Advocacy Program that sends students to Washington D.C. to lobby, which has established networks at the federal and UC level. Dagnachew said that as mental health coordinator, he helped start peer programs similar to UCSB’s at UCLA and UC Irvine. He said he has met other student leaders at U.S. Student Association (USSA) with similar if not the same goals for fighting tuition hikes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>GRASSROOTS OR LOBBYING?: </b>Hsu said change comes with both lobbying and grassroots organizing and it is important to realize that students have different strengths in participating to voice their concerns. Dagnachew agreed that both lobbying and grassroots work are effective, and he said he wants to work toward having students see the connection with their own efforts to the actions going on at the state and federal levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>STUDENT ACCESSIBILITY:</b> In response to a question about increasing student accessibility to the EVPSA, Dagnachew said his involvement in various organizations, canvassing for student programs such as CLAS and working as a Resident Assistant have prepared him to reach out to students. Hsu said it can be a challenge to be approachable, but she hopes to focus on communicating legislation to students that is not always clear to understand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. elections began on Sunday and and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Of course we’re going to protest,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara 1969 oil leak spilled an estimated 3 million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean. According to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, it was the worst oil spill in the nation’s history until 20 years later, when the Exxon Valdez dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil off the coast of Alaska.</p>\n<p>Following the Refugio oil spill of 2015 that spilled 80,000 gallons of crude oil, state and federal legislators enacted new laws, and Santa Barbara County worked alongside local environmental organizations to draft a plan of action in the event of a future pipe leak, as the <i>Nexus</i> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/effects-of-2015-oil-spill-persist-researchers-say/\">previously reported</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite such efforts, Zinke proposed on March 6 a region-wide, 73-million-acre lease sale offshore of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for oil and gas exploration and development.</p>\n<p>This lease sale will go into effect Aug. 16, 2017, which the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said will grant leases to the highest bidder for exploration.</p>\n<p>Davis said the SBSC put out a petition asking Zinke to not open up new offshore leases in the Santa Barbara County in hopes of preventing future pipe leaks. She said the petition has over 17,000 signatures.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to deliver it and that he gets the message that if they are going to open up [leases], there is going to be a real push back and a lot of opposition,” Davis said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77064\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77064\" data-attachment-id=\"77064\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-18/environmentalists-protest-arctic-oil-drilling-naysayers-wine-about-it/fullsizerender-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"FullSizeRender (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-77064\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FullSizeRender-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77064\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Local environmental groups spoke out against plans to expand offshore oil drilling amidst a visit by Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke to Santa Barbara on Monday. <em>Stephany Rubio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Of the 470 leases issued in the Pacific Ocean, 43 are active.

Suck Black D*ck Doesn’t Mean You’re Not Racist,” was part of the 18 total Pride Week events throughout Apr. 10-18. Johari Hunt, the event host and a first-year chemistry major, discussed queer history, racism, sexualization of black bodies and the intersection of people of color, social media and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event began with a discussion about queer history and what the minority community within the LGBTQ community looked like throughout the 1900s, specifically “drag ball culture” and the houses in New York that acted as safe spaces and cultural havens for the LGBTQ community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt went on to define racism, prejudice and how the “system of advantage based on race” allows society to understand various forms of oppression. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Racism isn’t defined by someone saying the n-word, but its systematic and institutional,” he said in an interview. “It is whenever a black person says they’re afraid of police. It is being seen as a criminal before you’re even seen as a child.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Racism] is … a system involving cultural messages and institutional policies and practices as well as the beliefs and actions of individuals,” Hunt added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting racism and prejudice to the perceptions and stereotypes of masculinity and femininity within the LGBTQ community led to an engaged discussion at the event about the intersections of social media, people of color and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt’s final segment focused on HIV/AIDS history and the fact that HIV and AIDS transmission within the black community has been neglected in conversations about sex. This has led to a lack of visibility about the topic, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During audience discussion, audience members pointed out the history of United States Vice President Mike Pence and the LGBT community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an archived version of </span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20010519165033fw_/http:/cybertext.net/pence/issues.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Vice President Pence’s 2000 congressional campaign addressed the issue of the Ryan White Care Act, which provides federal funding for </span><a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HIV</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/AIDS patients and was reauthorized by Congress that year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website stated that reauthorization of the act should be completed only after an audit to ensure that federal funding would not be given to organizations that “celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also stated that funding and resources “should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the World Health Organization, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, and about 35 million people have died of HIV. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, 1.1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, and Sub-Saharan Africa remains most severely affected.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76975\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76975\"

experiences, like being black and gay or living with HIV, that are not in a research paper or in an article, need to be talked about,” Hunt said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said the hardest part of organizing the event was putting something so blatant into context. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he wanted the audience to start a conversation about what it means to be a minority group in the LGBT community and learn about different life experiences within the LGBT community that most people do not realize exist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the process of creating the event, Hunt said he thought about issues that gay men face “all the time” and found that masculinity, and what it means to be masculine, is a critical concern.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Then it went to being black as perceived,” Hunt said. “And then I reached the actual sexualization of black bodies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunt said he felt the event presented his central points openly enough to promote and discuss as well as establish future conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He wanted his audience to leave “not with answers, but with the willingness to look for them.”</span></p><div

bus system is adding 14 new electric shuttles and introducing new farebox and smartphone technology to modernize its system as well as rebranding its 30-year-old logo.</p>\n<p>The Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) will accompany the technology with a new student access system in the next year, along with making changes to bus schedules beginning Aug. 21.</p>\n<p>According to reports by the American Public Transportation Association, UC Santa Barbara student ridership has increased by 31 percent from 2011 to 2016 — a contrast to the dropping rates both nationwide and in California.</p>\n<p>Nationwide ridership is decreasing, said Hillary Blackerby, MTD marketing and community relations manager, due in part to a sustained period of low gas prices and the change in landscape for transportation.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said they cannot point out a specific reason for declining ridership, but they are “definitely interested in competing for people’s ridership.”</p>\n<p>According to the MTD 2016-2021 Strategic Plan, “The vision of MTD is that public transit within the District should be so available and attractive that use of an automobile is a choice, not a necessity.”</p>\n<p>Despite national and statewide ridership trends, 14 new electric shuttles are being custom-made in Lancaster, CA, and after thorough training and testing, they will slowly be introduced to the district this summer.</p>\n<p>The new shuttles “show [their] commitment to the environment,” Blackerby said, and she hopes their schedule adjustments will improve bus arrival timing.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said the proposed schedule adjustments hope to combat traffic congestion, primarily near the Storke and Hollister intersection, which is caused by the new housing developments that have changed the traffic flow.</p>\n<p>MTD is also testing student ACCESS cards to see if they will be compatible with new fareboxes that will be installed later this year.</p>\n<p>Blackerby said the new boxes will work based off of a list of active student ID numbers that determine rider eligibility when a card is swiped. The boxes will replace the bus sticker system for UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students. MTD officials are still negotiating the details with the university, she said.</p>\n<p>A new smartphone app will also launch later this year to give real-time GPS tracking of buses en route, Blackerby said. The service will also be available via text for non-smartphone users.</p>\n<p>“As someone who has waited hours in line” at the A.S. Ticket Office to get a bus sticker, third-year history of public policy major and Off-Campus Senator Batsheva Stoll said she is looking forward to the new farebox system.</p>\n<p>Stoll said she believes this change will best serve students that live in the Santa Catalina dormitories because “They are the ones that use the bus the most to get to school.”</p>\n<p>Lines 12x and 24x, which run from UCSB to downtown Santa Barbara, will decrease in frequency, running every 35 minutes instead of the current 30 minutes. A few isolated trips will be removed throughout the day so the buses’ arrival times are more consistent.</p>\n<p>Lines 6, 11, 20, 21x, 23 and 25 will be slightly adjusted in timing but not reduced in frequency. A minor reroute will be made for Line 23 after 7 p.m. to accommodate the El Encanto Heights neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The UCSB and SBCC student line, 15x, will see a frequency increase of up to six minutes. An additional six trips in both directions will be added during “key parts of the day,” said Transit Planner Mark Clyde.</p>\n<p>Lines 1 and 2 will revert morning weekday commute hour services from 10-minute to 15-minute frequencies due to the loss of a grant source.</p>\n<p>The Nexus previously reported that a potential route from Goleta to Carpinteria during the morning and evening commute hours would become available through Caltrans funding. Blackerby told the <em>Nexus</em>, however, that Caltrans decided to not fund the project.</p>\n<p>“Their schedule is not tracking correctly with what is happening in reality, and to a lot of people [the changes] look like a cut at first, but I think they did a good job at clarifying,” said Director of the Isla Vista Community Services District Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>“It’s always better to have a schedule that is in line with reality so that folks don’t end up waiting at a bus stop,” said Brandt.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue

times before she finally reached South Korea after serving seven years in the North Korean People’s Army.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara’s Liberty in North Korea (L.I.N.K.) chapter hosted the two North Korean defectors this Thursday to talk about human rights violations and their journeys in escaping a dictatorship.</p>\n<p>L.I.N.K. brought the defectors to campus through its partnership with Young North Korea, a South Korean nonprofit organization that focuses on awareness of North Korean human rights.</p>\n<p>According to Athena Wan, the club’s co-president and a third-year economics and accounting major, the UCSB L.I.N.K. chapter is dedicated to funding escape missions, helping North Korean refugees integrate into the world and creating a community around human rights activism.</p>\n<p>Kim said he was part of the <i>kochebi</i>, a group of orphaned children of the “hostile” or lower class. The children would scavenge and beg for food in the streets after the economic turmoil that resulted from the death of President Kim Il-Sung in 1994.</p>\n<p>According to Kim, the lower class in North Korea is constantly under surveillance. Citizens who associate with any religion, make contact outside of the country or show dissent toward the government are criminalized and discriminated against.</p>\n<p>The second defector was a part of the “core” or elite class due to her father’s position as a battalion commander, but her whole family was placed in the hostile class after her mother’s escape to China.</p>\n<p>After her second escape attempt, she was captured but released after promising the government that she would spy on her neighbors and friends. She was imprisoned and released again after her third attempt, but was frustrated with the political structure and finally escaped to South Korea.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76763\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76763\" data-attachment-id=\"76763\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-09/north-korean-defectors-share-stories-at-ucsb/img_9093/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9093\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76763\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9093.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Elizabeth Hong</em></p></div>\n<p>Yang Mo, Young North Korea’s College Student Alliance external affairs representative, said he works with other organizations throughout South Korea to facilitate the integration of defectors into education and the workforce.</p>\n<p>Both defectors are now students at universities in South Korea.

Food Bank was founded in 2011 in response to rising tuition costs that left students in financial need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The food bank currently receives approximately 500 visits a day and 1,200 visits a week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Mondays and Wednesdays, the food bank has fresh produce that it purchases from the Santa Barbara County Food Bank, but organizers mostly provide dry foods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said organizers hope to get fresh produce for all three days after the facility expansion. They plan to receive produce donations from Edible Campus, a student-run farm that is going to launch within the next year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The expansion is happening at the same time that the UC Student Association picked student food and housing insecurities as their new initiative to focus on within the UC system. Hechler said 48 percent of students within the UCs identify as “food insecure.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like our food bank is humbly tucked away in the UCen and no one really knows about it, but we serve about 1,200 students a week, and that’s unreal compared to others,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hechler said he was the only one at the UC Council of Presidents who was able to say their campus had a successful food bank. He said UCSB is “way ahead” of other campuses in fighting student food insecurities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said that, aside from the food bank team, Hechler has “really pushed things forward to have things settled and made sure that the expansion happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said the whole food bank team got together to fight for the expansion, and she hopes to see it completed before she graduates in June.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully with the work that we’re doing, we can destigmatize the desire and need to get food aid when you need it,” Jones said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76597\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76597\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-01/a-s-food-bank-begins-facility-expansion-renovation/","id":2394,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2393,2392,2391],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The bluff-side seats provided a panoramic view of the contestants in the water.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First place went to James Burns, fourth-year financial mathematics and statistics major, because he was able to “get his feet on the nose of his board in every heat,” according to Benny Drescher, head organizer of the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Like in any surf contest, James won because he picked the right board for the day – a longboard, that is – and caught the best waves in each heat,” Drescher said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four judges scored the performances of each surfer. With each new round, the judges would drop the lowest-scoring surfers from the competition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They judge you on style, like if you fall or do something really well,” said Axel Eaton, fourth-year environmental studies major and competition contestant. “It’s subjective, but it’s the nature of the sport.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teams representing Greek houses joined in the competition, and each house donated a sum of money as part of their philanthropy efforts. Organizers also accepted donations from non-surfers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The competition raised $230 from contestant entry fees and general donations. Individual entries were $8 per person and $35 for teams of five. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proceeds from the contest will go toward the I.V. Surfrider’s campaign to distribute reusable party cups made entirely of recycled plastic. Some of the donations will also be sent to the Rainforest Action Network to benefit their Climate Action Fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we want to do with our campaign is minimize the waste of red solo cups by replacing them with the reusable ones,” judge Marcus Vicari and current I.V. Surfrider president said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers hope to get a bulk order of the cups to distribute to the contestants who can then document how much they have used the cups, Vicari said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefit competition is partly in response to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the middle of the Pacific Ocean that contains millions of pieces of polluting plastic, he said. The initiative stems from their “Rise Above Plastics” campaign that strives to help bring an end to single-use plastics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Surfrider foundation was founded on the thought to keep oceans clean and open to the public,” judge Zach Georgii of the San Luis Obispo Surfriders chapter said. “No person should be able to own a part of the ocean, and nobody should be polluting our waters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are also trying to get local restaurants in I.V. and Goleta to stop using single-use plastics in their “ocean friendly restaurants campaign.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V.

the closure, enforces environmental restoration regulations. The facility has submitted a plan to the CCC that aims to relocate the stables. <em>Min Xie / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Located near West Campus and the Devereux Slough, the property is home to an historic barn originally built in the 1920s as part of the Campbell Estate. It is now part of the UCSB Horse Boarders Association (HBA).</p>\n<p>According to the updated LRDP, the area that houses the facility will be restored to natural wetlands, although the HBA says the area has not functioned as a wetland in hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>Members are concerned the property is being used as “leverage” for the university to gain approval on future development projects from the California Coastal Commission (CCC).</p>\n<p>UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, said, however, that the stable is located on environmentally sensitive area of campus.</p>\n<p>“Due to the sensitive nature of the area, the California Coastal Commission has required the campus to plan for the removal of the stable facilities,” she said. “They have given us 10 years to remove the facility.”</p>\n<p>Estrada said the university also submitted a Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015, to allow possible relocation of the horse stables. The report outlines the monthly removal of manure from community horse arenas, efforts to minimize runoff to the wetlands and that horse stalls be cleaned weekly and communal areas (such as turnouts) be cleaned four times a week.</p>\n<p>Jenny Dugan, UCSB associate research biologist and HBA faculty advisor, works very closely with the CCC and submitted the Manure Management Plan to the CCC on March 25, 2015.</p>\n<p>Holly Nuovo, senior environmental studies major and treasurer of HBA, considers the plan pivotal to UCSB’s sustainability plan. “I know they include our manure tonnage in their sustainability reports, so whenever they’re talking about waste management, part of that is about us,” she said.</p>\n<p>The all natural and organic manure is donated to the Indigenous Gardening Club and other gardening communities in the area, making the reuse of the manure beneficial to UCSB’s sustainability plan.</p>\n<p>The CCC is a state organization that regulates the university’s developments. They aim to protect environmentally sensitive habitats, requiring the university to restore one area in tandem with any new development in the coastal area, like the Sierra Madre housing. The CCC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>The HBA has been active since the 1970s and has been fighting forced closures by the university since the 1990s. They have halted definitive closures by pressuring the chancellor’s office with an influx of letters intended to emphasize their value to the community.</p>\n<p>“They think that what we offer doesn’t have enough value, and so they can promise the Coastal Commission that they’ll remove our activity and restore the natural habitat in order to get approval for their other development projects,” said Nuovo.</p>\n<p>LRDP regulations prevent the HBA from changing the aerial view of the barn by creating any new permanent structures, repairs or effectively altering the “footprint” of the barn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75779\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75779\" data-attachment-id=\"75779\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/horse-1-by-min-xie/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Horse 1 by Min Xie\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-75779\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Horse-1-by-Min-Xie.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-75779\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The stables, located near West Campus and Devereaux Slough, sit atop environmentally sensitive areas.<br>Because of this, the campus has been tasked with closing the facilities down within the next 10 years. <em>Min Xie / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The LRDP restrictions maintain that repairs cannot result in the demolition or reconstruction of 50 percent or more of any structure. The facility also abides by the CCC’s environmental sustainability regulations.</p>\n<p>Lauren Rudnick, a second-year mechanical engineering major and member of the HBA, is currently making repairs to her horse’s stable and is mainly concerned with the longevity and safety of the stall.</p>\n<p>“These restrictions make it difficult to fully repair anything,” Rudnick said, adding that from a legal standpoint, the restrictions could be at fault if the animals or caretakers are harmed.</p>\n<p>Sitting about 300 to 400 yards away from the edge of the horse facility is a wetland buffer zone that the Coastal Commission closely maintains.</p>\n<p>The HBA has planted blackberries, Bermuda grass and other native bushes around the stalls and the buffer zone. The plants absorb nitrogen and other plant-growing material to filter the runoff from the horse’s manure so no harm comes to the wetlands.</p>\n<p>“It is possible to co-exist with the slough. We are doing it now,” Nuovo said.</p>\n<p>Existing restrictions to build in the area because of native burial sites and environmental concerns make the area convenient to use as “leverage,” Nuovo said. Pressure from UC Regents to make campuses larger put the university in a position to follow through with the closure.</p>\n<p>It would take roughly 20 years or more for the area to be restored as a wetland. The slough does not naturally reach the facility, so major excavations would occur for water to reach the area.</p>\n<p>“They use this land as a tool to return to the environment, but I honestly feel that what we do here helps the students integrate into the environment and the community at whole so much better than just returning it straight to wetland,” Nouvo said, adding that the facility offers affordable horse boarding opportunities to students that could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75806\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75806\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/horse-housing-facility-at-ucsb-may-be-bucked/","id":2720,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2719,2718,2717],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/87"}},"__N_SSG":true}
