Sworn in May 27 to fill vacancies left by three senators who stepped down shortly after the spring elections, on-campus senator and first-year undeclared major Elizabeth Brock and on-campus senator and first-year political science major Mercedes Rodriguez were selected by a special committee after an interview process to replace Brendan Korbas and David Xie. Off-campus senator and second-year political science major Kelly Pearman replaced Jake Johnson after having been his runner-up in the spring 2015 elections.</p>\n<p><b>ON-CAMPUS SENATOR </b><b>ELIZABETH BROCK</b></p>\n<p><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b>: Why did you apply to be an on-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I love being involved and am extremely passionate about impacting lives; I felt this position could give me a better chance in reaching as many students as possible across our campus and that my plans to impact our shared community could be put in motion more effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Have you been involved with A.S. before?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I have not, so this is very exciting for me!</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: How have you been involved at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: This past year, I’ve been the president of the amazing Santa Cruz Residence Hall … Being president automatically placed me in the Residence Halls Association … where I also discovered my passion for student affairs. I’m also a newer part of the National Residence Hall Honorary, or NRHH, and it’s been great getting to know that new family as well.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you hope to accomplish this year?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I hope to eventually separate Counseling and Psychological Services [C.A.P.S.] from Career Services, as they’re both currently housed in the same building … It’s absurd that certain counselors at C.A.P.S. have offices the size of closets … I believe the C.A.P.S. building should also be painted and possibly renovated. Hopefully, there can be a collaboration with our university’s art department to create some beautiful murals over that Pepto-Bismol pink. That space is supposed to be a welcoming invitation for students seeking help, and walking up to that building illustrates the exact opposite. We should feel motivated and inspired when entering the C.A.P.S. environment, and brightening its atmosphere would truly help.</p>\n<p>Another project I’d like to take on is placing mental health kits in every room of every residence hall before move-in day Fall Quarter. I feel this will show incoming as well as returning students how valuable and vital our mental well-being is. By placing these kits in the rooms first thing, we’ll be able to create a healthier, more active and more knowledgeable mental health environment where students will hopefully begin to value their internal well-being much more seriously.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Why do you think you will be a good senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>: I am straightforward when addressing situations, and I’m not afraid to communicate when hard conversations are needed … My compassion for others and my overall love for our university drives my passion to be in this position and will allow me to work devotedly and wholeheartedly towards every goal that’s in front of me. I maintain a very open mind, and I love to hear about ways to improve what’s already set in motion. I believe in listening to other perspectives before solidifying any decision … I am qualified with leading a council and being an active and leading member in multiple organizations through high school to now. I enjoy working in a team and deeply value collaboration and coexisting efforts to get things done, which I believe will help me connect with departments across campus to complete my mental health projects.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you want to change about A.S.?</b></p>\n<p><i>Brock</i>:  A.S. should not be about who’s in which party, who has the greatest ego or who’s enemies and friends with who. There should not be that internal drama because it infects the organization and results negatively in helping our community and constituents. We should all be working together towards the same goal of bettering our campus to brighten student lives.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>OFF-CAMPUS SENATOR KELLY PEARMAN</b></p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: Why did you run to be an off-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I chose to run to be a senator because I really wanted the opportunity to improve the campus and community for students and Isla Vista residents. I really have the passion to be a voice for students and I am so excited to be one of their representatives. I can’t wait to create change.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What experience do you have being involved in the UCSB community?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I have been involved in A.S. for the past two years. As a first-year, I was a fellow in the Internal Vice President’s Office. During my second year at UCSB, I was the senate coordinator in the Internal Vice President’s Office and I was also the recruitment and outreach coordinator for Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>I am a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. I was also involved with RHA during my first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What projects do you want to complete as a senator this year?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: My first project goal is to create a more interactive training for sexual assault intervention and prevention. I want to work with Panhellenic and Interfraternity Council to implement this. Also, I want to collaborate with my fellow senators Austin Hechler and Mika Kawakami on this project, who also have knowledge about Greek life.</p>\n<p>Another project I want to work on is developing a long-term parking plan in Isla Vista … It is creating safety problems and causing I.V. residents to receive citations. I want to work with the EVPLA Office and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol on this project along with holding forums for students to voice their opinion on how they want parking to change in the future. Having a lot of student input is really important.</p>\n<p>My third project goal is to create vending machines in Isla Vista with school and study supplies in them so students can access these resources at any time of the day. A few previous senators have worked on this project, and I want to continue it and implement it.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you think will be your biggest challenge during your time as off-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I expect that it will be challenging to work with 24 other very passionate people, and I know some meetings will be difficult when our opinions clash.</p>\n<p>People will disagree, but I plan to put myself in other people’s shoes to understand where they are coming from. I think it’s really important to try to understand why people believe the things they do and that will really help me in deciding about legislation and working with people throughout the year.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you want incoming senators to do differently than their predecessors?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I think that the Senate should really take the time and effort during the first few weeks of the term to really get to know the Legal Code, the financial policies and the structure of the association itself. When Senators are more knowledgeable about the association and its governing documents, etcetera, they will be able to navigate it a lot better when writing legislation and when they are initiating projects.</p>\n<p>Senators should definitely take extra steps to work with Senators that they normally hadn’t already worked with. It makes Senate a closer group of people with better camaraderie and working rapport.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What will make you a good senator?</b></p>\n<p><i>Pearman</i>: I have been very involved in A.S. for the last two years, and this gives me the experience and knowledge about what students want, and how we as student leaders can give that to them. Being the senate coordinator for a year gave me the knowledge of what it means and what it takes to be a great senator. I also have worked with past senators on projects and legislation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>ON-CAMPUS SENATOR MERCEDES RODRIGUEZ</b></p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: </b><b>Why did you apply to be an on-campus senator?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez:</em> At first, I didn’t know much about it, so my RA kind of encouraged me because I’m in Hall Council currently and he thought it would be a good fit for me, and he also explained to me how we can help advocate for students and get their voices heard, and that’s what I really want to focus on, being a political science major actually wanting to go into activism.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: How have you been involved at UCSB?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>I actually wasn’t involved in A.S., I was just involved in Hall Council. I was a multicultural awareness chair, so I pick up on all of the isms, and that made me a lot more aware … I think knowing a lot more of those ideas is going to help me just kind of implement the things that I actually want to see being done … I think racism is going to be a huge one.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What are your goals for the coming year?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>Definitely just trying to push for diversity, I think that’s going to be my focal point for this year. Not necessarily to offset the demographics, but kind of teach people that our demographics are not as correct as some people might think they are, and that the underrepresented do have a voice and they’re actually very vital to our school. So I’m going to be focusing definitely on the minorities and just having their voices heard and all their work being recognized.</p>\n<p>Living on the multicultural floor this year, I know I definitely want to bring it back because I know it is going to change into a first-generation floor. But I want to bring back the multicultural floor definitely because I feel like it had a huge impact on my overall experience of being a first-year … For now, that’s the only concrete idea I have, because I just currently was aware that I got into office.</p>\n<p><b><i>DN</i></b><b>: What do you think will be your biggest challenge as a senator?</b></p>\n<p><em>Rodriguez: </em>Being biracial, first of all, because I am Caucasian and I am Hispanic so it’s kind of hard to be myself in both positions, because I do look more Hispanic, I get mistaken for being full Hispanic … I’m going to try to understand both sides of the spectrum, but it’s just going to be really hard.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63991\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63991\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-02/new-a-s-senators-discuss-goals-for-upcoming-year/","id":2738,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2737,2736,2735],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"One Year Later: Candlelit Vigil and March Remembers Students Lost","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=600%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Storke Tower rang out six times Saturday evening to begin a moment of silence as part of the Candlelit Vigil and March held to commemorate the students lost in the events of May 23 last year.

Following a dance piece titled <em>Not One More</em> and an a capella performance of “Amazing Grace,” participants walked to People’s Park carrying Blunite blue LED lights.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Program Board organized the night’s event, which included an open mic in the park for speakers who wished to share memories of the victims. The vigil concluded with a video screening, paying tribute to the students lost and highlighting the solidarity demonstrated within the I.V. community following the tragedy.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said UCSB will continue to honor the lives lost on May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“Tragedy will not tear us apart but bring us closer together,” Yang said. “We will never forget the loss we suffered a year ago, but we remember not just with sadness, but with fondness.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has established six unique memorial scholarships in honor of each of the victims, according to Yang.</p>\n<p>“We can make their lives more meaningful by the way we choose to live our own, and we can make the lives of others more meaningful in the ways we choose to honor them,” Yang said. “We will uphold their memory now and in years to come with six individual memorial scholarships … individualized to reflect their character and their passions.”</p>\n<p>Academic Senate chair and sociology professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani read a letter on behalf of the Hong family which stated the need for a cultural shift away from violence.</p>\n<p>“James believed in a world without evil, a world where tragic instances like this would never occur. We hope it will become a reality,” the Hong family stated in the letter. “Parenting and mental well-being should be focused on more in family, school and society. We should put more emphasis on moral values and teach kids to see the good in others and respect others.”</p>\n<p>Richard Martinez, father of Chris Martinez, said those affected by the tragedy should continue to live their lives as a testament to those lost.</p>\n<p>“For our absent brothers, daughters, sisters and friends, for their sake we must also live,” Martinez said. “We can mourn for those we lost, and we can go on living. There is no contradiction in this. We must remember that making something of this life is not an affront to the dead.”</p>\n<p>Alan Martinez, uncle of Chris Martinez, said he continues to mourn as memories of the tragedy resurface.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a little afraid of being in a world where people expect me to be over it after a year,” Martinez said. “Every time I forget it, if it’s for a few minutes or a few hours, remembering it again is like going through it again. Every time you forget about it and remember it you have to accept it again.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63764\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1244942648\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63790\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63764\" data-attachment-id=\"63764\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-24/one-year-later-students-remembered-in-candlelit-vigil-and-march/2015-vigil_lorenzo-basilio-21/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1432413353\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2015 Vigil_Lorenzo Basilio-21\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63764\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-Vigil_Lorenzo-Basilio-21.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Isla Vista residents created a memorial in front of IV Deli Mart in remembrance of Chris Martinez. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Kelly Wang, mother of George Chen, said she hopes to see social and political changes prevent future shootings.</p>\n<p>“I pray there will be an end of the senseless killing of innocents,” Wang said. “Murderers must be punished with no excuse, no exception, and no reservation. As a victim family, we hope that this horrible massacre was a wake up call and no time shall be wasted in striving for future prevention.”</p>\n<p>Counseling and Psychological Services director Jeanne Stanford said she was glad to see the victims’ families in attendance at the memorial event.</p>\n<p>“They were able to absorb the love that this community has and to share with us how they’re doing, and I think that’s important for the students to know,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Computer science professor Phillip Conrad said he taught George, James and David in CMPSC 40: Foundations of Computer Science. According to Conrad, the three students were well-liked and he has positive memories of them sitting in the front row of his class.</p>\n<p>“It is a convention, that when someone is taken from us, we only remember the good things, we only speak of the good things. But as I told James, George and David’s parents today, in their case there are only good things to say,” Conrad said. “People only said good things of George, David and James when they were with us, because that’s all there was to say.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tragedy will not tear us apart but bring us closer together. We will never forget the loss we suffered a year ago, but we remember not just with sadness, but with fondness. – Chancellor Henry T. Yang</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stephanie Barlev, Weiss’ water polo teammate of four years, said a quote from Weiss inspired her to speak during open mic.</p>\n<p>“I would like share it with everyone else, ‘If I could live my life over again, I wouldn’t change anything … I am happy with my life.’ I ask that everyone live like Veronika Weiss did,” Barlev said. “Living every second with the friends closest to you, being spontaneous and laughing obnoxiously.”</p>\n<p>Joni Kent, aunt of Cooper, said the lights at the memorial event reminded her of Cooper’s personality.</p>\n<p>“Katie was a light,” Kent said. “She would have absolutely loved this.”</p>\n<p>Second-year Santa Barbara City College student Kyle Sullivan said he comforted Cooper and Weiss in their final moments.</p>\n<p>“They were so beautiful even in their last moments.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus \" width=\"500\" height=\"750\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63408\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Das Williams.<em> Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The California State Assembly Committee on Local Government voted 6-1 with two abstentions on Wednesday to re-refer Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) to the Joint Committee on Fairs, Allocation and Classification.</p>\n<p>The bill establishes Isla Vista self-governance through a Community Services District (CSD) funded by a Utility Users Tax (UUT), if approved by voters within the district’s proposed boundaries. Williams wrote AB 3 as an alternative to establishing a CSD through the Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) in order to address the need for improved infrastructure and services in the I.V. community. Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud organized a group of UCSB students and I.V. residents to speak in favor of the bill during public comment.</p>\n<p>Assemblymember Williams said the bill is going straight to the committee because previous attempts to establish I.V. self-governance over the last 45 years have been stifled by LAFCO.</p>\n<p>“When a local LAFCO cannot take care of a very important, complicated but ever-present problem for 45 years, do we have the authority to take that back and act ourselves?” Williams said. “I think we do.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the bill has been thoroughly evaluated by the community since first being introduced to the Assembly in December.</p>\n<p>“While the CSD is not going through the traditional LAFCO process, this bill has undergone extensive community outreach, including 42 public meetings and four public town halls,” Williams said. “It truly reflects the majority opinion from the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the current conditions in I.V. are at a “breaking point” and require improved services such as additional police, a parking district and a tenant mediation program.</p>\n<p>“Critical infrastructure and services are not being provided and the safety and wellbeing of I.V.’s residents are not being adequately protected,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year political science and psychology double major Cameron Schunk said AB 3 is an opportunity to redefine I.V. through the establishment of CSD.</p>\n<p>“We have consistently had a lack of opportunity to prove ourselves,” Schunk said. “We are consistently at the behest of media sources and every time something happens in Isla Vista, we are painted colors that we have no choice or say in.”</p>\n<p>Chair of the Local Governance Committee Assemblymember and UCSB alumnus Brian Maienschein said, while he chose to abstain from voting on the motion because of his connection to USCB, he plans to continue working with Williams on AB 3.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is unique,” Maienschein said. “I have been persuaded by the testimony today and just kind of my life experience there, so I won’t quite get to ‘yes,’ but I want to keep working with you and your office on this.”</p>\n<p>Maienschein said that AB 3 resonates with him on a personal level because of his experience living in Isla Vista for three years.</p>\n<p>“I think Isla Vista sits in a unique position,” Maienschein said, “because of all the issues that have traditionally been there back since my time up through the current time. In fact, the latest incident was in literally one of the exact blocks I lived on. So this hits close to home for me.”</p>\n<p>Thirty-three year I.V. resident and homeowner Pegeen Souter said she opposes the bill and favors the LAFCO process because she feels AB 3 does not clarify funding and the role of UC Santa Barbara in a CSD.</p>\n<p>“It takes time and information to craft a solid and lasting form of government,” Souter said. “If this bill is to move forward, then it should go through the LAFCO process.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara LAFCO Executive Officer Paul L. Hood said the commission is taking an “oppose unless amended position” on AB 3, and the commission should be included in the formation process to ensure a financially feasible CSD.</p>\n<p>“We strongly believe the Santa Barbara LAFCO should be involved in the formation process,” Hood said. “We also believe that the LAFCO process would afford a feasibility study to be prepared, which would determine the viability, the sustainability of revenues that would be available to the new CSD.”</p>\n<p>California Association of Local Agency Formation Commissions (CALAFCO) Executive Director Pamela Miller said the commission does not oppose the CSD itself, but believes LAFCO should be included in its establishment.</p>\n<p>“CALAFCO is not arguing whether or not a CSD is the appropriate mechanism, our concerns lie in the bypassing of the LAFCO process,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Miller said, while there are certain components in AB 3 that LAFCO cannot grant, excluding the commission may lead to greater risks.</p>\n<p>“It is true, as the assemblyman said that LAFCO cannot approve the proposed governance structure or the proposed services to be provided,” Miller said. “But bypassing the comprehensive analysis is very dangerous … all of our concerns would be addressed if a comprehensive review by the LAFCO were done.”</p>\n<p>Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs board member and second-year communications and film and media studies double major Arielle Kronovet said one the biggest issues facing I.V. is inadequate parking.</p>\n<p>“I’m lucky I have parkway so I don’t have to deal with parking,” Kronovet said. “But last year I was searching sometimes for hours trying to find parking, and I couldn’t afford parking on campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Kronovet, students need the government to protect students from property management companies that abuse their power and take advantage of students.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the year, my house was robbed,” Kronovet said. “There was no evidence of forced entry so the property management wouldn’t change the locks and they had a key. I called the property management, and they told me it wasn’t a high priority issue.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said a CSD in I.V. will require components LAFCO cannot establish, such as a UUT and a hybrid board with elected and hybrid board with elected and appointed members representing entities such as UCSB, SBCC and Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“What I wanted to convey to the legislature was the uniqueness of Isla Vista, and the fact that we had demanded a unique solution, requiring some elements that [neither] LAFCO nor the board of supervisors could grant,” Farr said. “Only the legislature could.”</p>\n<p>Farr said LAFCO members should offer alternative ways to help I.V. rather than criticize AB 3.</p>\n<p>“I can understand [LAFCO] having concerns, but they did not express more concern and care for the future of the community,” Farr said. “You can have questions and you can have concerns, but also, show us that you really do want to be helpful. I have to say I haven’t gotten that sense at the meetings.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, Isla Vista does not have a high source of income from sales or property taxes.</p>\n<p>“[I.V.] doesn’t have a lot of commercial development or other kinds of sales tax or transient occupancy tax generators, hotels and such and the community,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>“Properties in the community don’t change hands very often, so the property tax that has been being paid is probably much lower than if the property was sold and then reassessed.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator-elect and second-year political science major Louis Mariano said he appreciates Farr’s supporting AB 3 regardless of her position in the county.</p>\n<p>“She’s always been there for Isla Vista and been working hard for the county to focus on it,” Mariano said. “She’s in a tight squeeze, but I am very grateful she was for the bill, because she knows Isla Vista needs help.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said Maienschein’s support of AB 3 shows the importance of I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“It shows Isla Vista has faced the same issues over and over without a way to correct them permanently,” Abboud said. “The root of the issue has been no local control and no local self-determination. I think him being moved by his own personal experiences is indicative of why we need to pass this bill.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, students have shown they can efficiently hold leadership positions regardless of how long they live and stay in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Students are regularly elected and do a wonderful job,” Abboud said. “Just because students with a little ‘S’ are transient, students with a big ‘S’ aren’t.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article was titled “Contested Bill Addresses Isla Vista Self-Governance”.

Yang’s office from Wednesday afternoon to Thursday morning to demand specific policies to improve the handling of sexual assault cases, concluding the night with a signature from Yang ensuring the enactment of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V2Y7OcloAaEc8gA8S8b-gpMDI-DGq6lUIW-uF5L_Ico/edit?usp=sharing\">13 policies</a> that favor survivors.</p>\n<p>Yang, along with Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob and Senior Associate Dean for Student Life Debbie Fleming, agreed to consider immediate suspension for perpetrators, implement a minimum sanction for sexual assault crimes and immediately remove perpetrators from university-owned housing. In addition, administrators decided to take steps to increase staff diversity and implement faculty training on cultural and identity sensitivity. Yang committed to cover full travel expenses for Melgoza, Weyrick and Vasquez to speak at the May 20 UC Regents meeting in San Francisco and approved eight additional demands. Melgoza, Weyrick and Vasquez will meet with Yang again on Monday to present a budget and discuss details and execution of the agreements.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Melgoza said Yang and administrators met the demands with only a few changes to the wording.</p>\n<p>“All the demands are going to be in print … and the whole school’s going to see them,” Melgoza said. “We made a few adjustments, but just on the wording and on the jargon of everything. They were pretty concrete demands, and they met them.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she looks forward to attending UCSB as an ordinary student knowing there will now be policies to sanction sexual assault offenders and provide support to victims.</p>\n<p>“It’s been such a part of my life throughout my college experience that I don’t remember what it’s like to be a normal college student,” Melgoza said. “I’m excited to see what that will look like, where I will be fighting for other students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s been such a part of my life throughout my college experience that I don’t remember what it’s like to be a normal college student. I’m excited to see what that will look like.           – Alejandra Melgoza</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gaucho Consent Co-Chair and second-year sociology major Weyrick said the group will continue to organize and push their demands to the UC level to ensure system-wide sanctions for perpetrators of sexual misconduct.</p>\n<p>“This is clearly the beginning — not the end — for us,” Weyrick said. “We have a meeting on Monday set up and the Regents-wide meeting will be big for some of these [demands] that we can implement on a UC-wide basis outside of just UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Weyrick said the group communicated with various organizations to accomplish their goals, initiating conversations about gender representative safety programs with Isla Vista Foot Patrol and establishing a survivor fund for sexual assault victims.</p>\n<p>According to Weyrick, one of the most important accomplishments of the sit-in was a mandate ensuring the removal of students from residence halls if they are found guilty of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest victory was understanding the power of student activism, there’s so much here that we accomplished.” Weyrick said. “If we were just three students sitting in an office … they wouldn’t have [been] taken as seriously, so I feel like the credit needs to go to the bodies that came here and chose to work with us and help us.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Melissa Vasquez said the administrators met the initial demands the group had when they began the sit-in.</p>\n<p>“We came here with something in mind and administration wasn’t trying to hear us out and stuff,” Vasquez said. “We were able to put our foot down and be able to get our demands met, and we had something in mind when we got here and we left with it, too, so it’s kind of really exciting.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63397\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1154692763\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63423\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63397\" data-attachment-id=\"63397\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/students-demand-change/rape-protest/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"John Clow\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"Rape Protest\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431518175\",\"copyright\":\"John Clow\\/DN\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00025\",\"title\":\"Rape Protest\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Rape Protest\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63397 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"John Clow/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Demonstration_John-Clow-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Yang said he was grateful students and administrators were ultimately able to work together.</p>\n<p>“I appreciate the opportunity to hear the survivors speak and also that students have come up with proposals for solutions,” Yang said. “We will continue to refine these solutions.”</p>\n<p>Associated Students President and fourth-year sociology major Ali Guthy said in addition to the approved demands, the university should develop a sexual assault policy specific to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“UCSB doesn’t have our own sexual assault policies. We rely on the UC-wide policy, which I think is really problematic, given that every campus has our own unique circumstances and things that need to be considered,” Guthy said.  “We really need to develop policies that are specific to UCSB, that are consistent, that we can all adhere to.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said while she cannot speak to the experiences of sexual assault survivors, their stories were compelling and demanded administrative attention.</p>\n<p>“I am concerned for the survivors’ well-being and that everyone is being treated fairly in a consistent manner, and, to me, it seems that our university has failed to meet those basic standards for procedures … the cases we have been hearing today are very compelling,” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza said he believes the university does not have appropriate measures in place to support survivors of sexual assault.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were able to put our foot down and be able to get our demands met, and we had something in mind when we got here. -Melissa Vasquez</p></blockquote>\n<p>“What we saw, it’s the power of student action, student activism,” Mirza said. “We have a serious problem with how sexual assault is handled, with how survivors are treated by administration, by Judicial Affairs and by students on this campus.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said the group will continue fighting to ensure the university enforces the sanctions against sexual misconduct offenders.</p>\n<p>“When they come here and occupy this office and when the supporters of them join them for over 12 hours demanding the changes happen, we were able to make that difference,” Mirza said. “Hopefully, the school’s going to be much better off, and we’re going to keep pressuring the chancellor and administration that they honor the agreements they made tonight, but it’s a historic win.”</p>\n<p>Mirza also said as next year’s A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), he will ensure the office continues to work on long-term sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>“Next year, we will be working on making sure that these demands and more changes to make these policies much better will be put in place,” Mirza said. “But many of the changes should be coming very quickly.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated Alejandra Melgoza is a second-year Chican@ studies and political science double major. However, Melgoza is a second year double majoring in Chican@ studies and history of public policy.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63423\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63423\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/yang-meets-sexual-assault-survivors-demands/","id":2754,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[2753,2752,2751],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Update on Sabado Tarde Rd.

Law enforcement officials are currently investigating whether the disturbance was drug related.</p>\n<p>According to the report, both victims sustained what is “characterized to be gunshot wounds” from a handgun found at the scene. Both victims are being treated at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and are expected to recover from their injuries. The third patient at the hospital was confirmed to be Taylor, who sustained head wounds from the incident that do not appear to be life threatening.</p>\n<p>A short while after the altercation on Sabado Tarde, a Hispanic male arrived at Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital with injuries he claimed were sustained during a vehicle accident on the UCSB campus. The man was transferred to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital due to the nature of his injuries and confirmed to be Gutierrez.</p>\n<p>Both Taylor and Guitierrez are under police custody but will remain in the hospital due to their injuries until they can be released. Taylor is booked on charges of Attempted Murder, Robbery, Discharge of a firearm in the commission of a felony causing great bodily injury, and Participation in a Criminal Street Gang. Gutierrez is booked on charges of Attempted Murder, Robbery, Possession of a Stolen Firearm, Participating in a Criminal Street Gang and Discharge of a firearm in the commission of a felony causing great bodily injury.</p>\n<p>SBCSO Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said the shooting “triggers” emotions given the one-year anniversary of the events of <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1765064422\"><span class=\"aQJ\">May 23</span></span> is less than two weeks away.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, everybody out here right now is very sensitive right now, coming on heels of the one-year anniversary, just the thought of anyone being injured out here in Isla Vista, I think, just makes everyone’s heart sink,” Hoover said. “So there is definitely great concern on behalf of the public. We’re getting lots of calls — a lot of people very, very worried.”</p>\n<p>Hoover said while it is uncertain whether <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_1765064423\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Monday’s</span></span> shooting is connected to the three armed robberies that took place last week, law enforcement has reason to believe there is a connection between the robberies that occurred on May 3 and May 4.</p>\n<p>“At this point, that is all under investigation. It’s likely there is a relation between definitely the alleged victim, who also later was arrested,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated as of 6:39 p.m. on May 12, 2015.</em></p>\n<div

The series of events aims to provide students and I.V. residents the opportunity to learn how AB 3 could benefit the community and to advocate for I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>Williams introduced AB 3 to the State Assembly in December 2014 to establish a Community Services District (CSD) with the ability to levy taxes to provide residents with improved local services and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the events are meant to motivate and inform students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“It’s educational, and it’s also in the hopes of empowering people to do work surrounding AB 3, be involved in the process, to really engage with both the bill and the concept of self-governance,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District (IVRPD) board member and second-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the key to successfully advocating for AB 3 is to educate I.V. residents by canvassing door to door.</p>\n<p>“I really think it’s just getting the word out,” Dela Cruz said. “There’s no way that we can just mail something out and hope that everyone knows about this. You literally have to go and knock on doors and talk to people. So it’s more talking to them and having them engage in the conversation that we’re having.”</p>\n<p>Williams said community engagement will be key to ensuring the events over the next two weeks are successful.</p>\n<p>“This is the time to show the Legislature that local support exists for AB 3, a bill which will create a community services district to meet the specific and unique needs of Isla Vista,” Williams said in an email. “Having backing from the County of Santa Barbara and surrounding cities is crucial to show the need for more direct government in this area.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, AB 3 supporters being present at this week’s meetings and next week in Sacramento will be key to the bill’s success.</p>\n<p>“Bottom line is we need Isla Vista community members to rally together and be heard in the Legislature,” Williams said in an email. “Their presence is critical to ensure passing of this bill. Their voices need to be heard. They know the challenges first-hand and can serve as a strong force to move this bill successfully through the legislative process.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said AB 3 is unique piece of legislation because it was developed through I.V. stakeholders’ collective efforts.</p>\n<p>“Usually, legislation kind of just comes from Sacramento,” Schunk said. “To the contrary, Das Williams and his office have really kind of stepped up to the plate and done what I think is an outstanding job of really engaging the community.”</p>\n<p>Williams and the Initiative are asking for increased community involvement because of the bill’s importance to the I.V. self-governance movement, according to Schunk.</p>\n<p>“This bill is so monumental, so it deserves extra attention,” Schunk said. “Every resident of Isla Vista will somehow be impacted by this, so I think it’s critical that we try and hear from as many voices as possible.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said, while he hopes to see a significant number of supporters turn out for the County Legislative Committee, Goleta City Council and LAFCO meetings, he has realistic expectations.</p>\n<p>“I would like to see at least 10 people at each of those meetings, and I don’t think that’s going to be outlandish,” Schunk said. “The more voices that are heard by these different entities, the more they realize that there is a broad and diverse backing for this movement.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he knows Associated Students will have a significant presence at the AB 3 events, but believes there will also be a strong turn out from non-A.S. students.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, I do expect a lot of A.S. members to be there, because those are typically the people who are politically engaged,” Schunk said. “I also do think that we’ve gotten quite a few students both from SBCC and from UCSB who are not involved in student government.”</p>\n<p>According to Dela Cruz, the series of events aims to also include non-student residents and Latino families who are not as involved in the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“We had canvassing for the Family Fun Day … where we had volunteers to help us canvas, and just talked to the community,” Dela Cruz said. “Specifically, families for the Family Fun Day geared towards Isla Vista long-term residents and Latino families who don’t often come to our weekly AB 3 meetings on Tuesdays.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said the goal of the AB 3 events is to show Sacramento legislators there is broad local support for the bill.</p>\n<p>“That’s why we are seeking endorsements from the County and Goleta as well as the residents of I.V. itself, getting people to every event is going to be challenge due to the meetings being scheduled during work/school hours and out of our control,” Abboud said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

the clubs on campus to educate the student body on their rights,” Morse said. “I am hoping to work with the county and help develop the 501(c)3 I discussed during the campaign season — hopefully

discussed.</p>\n<p>“There were a number of ways we could have won,” Garshfield said. “One was by getting the greatest number of votes up there and another was by making a difference in the way

I’ve done it for a couple years, but it’s just great every year to see that students want to participate in the whole electoral process, that they want to get educated on, you know, who’s coming out and I’m just really excited to start the year,” Villarreal said. “I was nervous. It’s always fun; it’s always a little nerve wracking during the election period but just now I’m ready to start going to work.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and current EVPSA Melvin Singh said he is apprehensive about the UC tuition hikes and expressed his willingness to aid Mirza and Lopez in their continued work with A.S.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern is seeing how tuition increase and all that will go next year, and making sure both of them are prepped for it, and of course I’m going to be there to prep them before I term out,” Singh said. “I mean I was pretty comfortable being in that room and seeing whatever happened so at this point I’m just making sure both of them are set for their path from now on.”</p>\n<p>Incoming IVP and third-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian said while she is looking forward to taking office, she was disappointed her fellow Open People’s Party EVPSA candidate Lopez lost the campaign.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62781\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"444391965\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62764\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62781\" data-attachment-id=\"62781\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/a-s-elections-end-with-near-sweep/elections-will-tran-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429817311\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Elections Will Tran-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62781 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Elections Will Tran-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elections-Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-62781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former executives came by to see the election results. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“As a party it’s like we don’t win until we all win, so we were very nervous about the EVPSA position and once his is announced it was kinda like the mood kinda went down,” Hashemian said. “So when mine was announced I was excited but at the same time, you know, in my mind there was still the fact that our EVPSA did not win so it’s not as joyous as I wish it were.”</p>\n<p>Current Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said she is satisfied with her accomplishments during her term in office and is looking forward to the continued improvements to be made by Hashemian.</p>\n<p>“What I hope that she can improve from what I did last year is just to really transition better and do a better orientation for the entire association,” Lau said. “I thought I did a really good job with the senators and the senators I felt like were really equipped with all the different resources and things they needed to know to be in office.

id=\"caption-attachment-62522\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate voted against Students for Justice in Palestine’s resolution to divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine by a tiebreaker secret ballot of 13-12-1 after a lengthy eight-hour meeting last night in the Old Little Theater and Givertz 1004.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting major and A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau took the votes on the resolution by secret ballot and gave the tie-breaking “no” vote following the Senate’s initial 12-12 split and one abstention over whether or not to pass the resolution. The failure of the resolution to pass marks the third consecutive year the A.S. Senate has denied passage of a divestment resolution. UCSB and UC Merced remain the only UC campuses whose undergraduate student governments have not passed divestment resolutions, with UC Irvine being the first campus to pass divestment in Nov. 2012.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major and SJP member Anumita Kaur co-authored the resolution which calls for the UC Regents, UCSB, Associated Students and the UCSB Foundation to withdraw investments from several companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine. The resolution specifically names Motorola, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, Caterpillar, Boeing, General Electric and Hewlett-Packard as companies infringing on citizenship rights of those in the region.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Garza, second-year Ph.D candidate in the department of sociology and SJP member, said the organization is disappointed with the outcome of the Senate’s vote.</p>\n<p>“We are frustrated that our Associated Students will go another year being complicit with these human rights violations perpetrated by these companies, but we are also as motivated as ever because … in the way the debate has changed the past few years, we feel that it’s only a matter of time … a global movement like this can’t be stopped by the vote of a handful of A.S. senators,” Garza said.</p>\n<p>Second-year CCS physics major and CCS collegiate senator Liam Stanton, who called for a roll call vote prior to the motion to vote on the resolution, said the secret vote forced Lau to take responsibility for the consequences of the vote.</p>\n<p>“What makes me upset about the result of tonight’s vote wasn’t which side won or lost,” Stanton said. “It was the fact that we didn’t have the courage as public representatives to put our votes out there.”</p>\n<p>Stanton said the tie vote and resulting tiebreaker decided by Lau created an unfortunate situation in which Lau will “almost singularly” receive blame for the decision.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think either side behaved particularly well,” Stanton said. “We instead forced the president of our Senate to put out her vote. She was the only public vote and so all of us got to hide, except for those who announced their vote. She had to take the heat almost singularly for everyone else from the community who feels marginalized now.”</p>\n<p>Second-year communication and political science double major and off-campus senator Hiro Bower said she called for a secret ballot because she believed it was necessary given the strongly opposing sides on the divestment movement.</p>\n<p>“I called for a secret ballot. That’s why I defended having a secret ballot … people have a lot of very strong opinions about this,” Bower said. “How do you make a decision when you’re considering the entire student body, when the entire student body has two very different sides?”</p>\n<p>According to Bower, situations like divestment increase pressure on A.S. Senators to carry out decisions as representatives of the totality of the student body.</p>\n<p>“So in that case a lot of pressure is put on your shoulders and not everybody is comfortable with facing everybody there because you cannot make a decision without feeling horrible about it,” Bower said. “Yes, that’s like something we took on when we decided to run, we all knew that this was coming … but still, at the end of the day, we’re students.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Michelle Moreh, one of the main senators in opposition to the resolution, said the Israeli West Bank barrier separating Israel and Palestine is necessary because of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Israel.</p>\n<p>“No one is arguing that all Palestinians are terrorists, but how should Israel deal with terrorist organizations that are hiding themselves amongst civilians and using them as a cover to murder Israelis?” Moreh said. “In my opinion, one-sided security shouldn’t come at the expense of others. But this is happening because we have terrorist organizations that have left Israel with really no other way to keep its people safe. When terrorists put their weapons down and their hatred down, the wall comes down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year mechanical engineering major and engineering collegiate senator Jonathan Rothschild said he did not support the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I cannot applaud the decision for the resolution to not acknowledge a two-state solution,” Rothschild said. “What is so wrong with acknowledging Israel’s right to exist?”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Guy Singer said he was against the resolution because it did not reflect any input from the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“We’ve worked for the past two years to build alternatives and to build roads of cooperation and making out investment system more socially, environmentally and governmentally more responsible, and these efforts have been met with nothing but disdain from the pro-BDS community,” Singer said. “Any divestment resolution in the future will have to incorporate the Jewish community in some way or another in order for it to work.”</p>\n<p>Second-year film and media studies and philosophy double major and Off-campus Senator Jenna Anderson said she supported the resolution, but wanted to see amendments made.</p>\n<p>“As you can see, most every senator has expressed concerns with the wording of this resolution,” Anderson said. “Maybe I’m an idealist, but I just don’t get why we can’t come together and fix certain parts of it just to make it a little bit more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said A.S. should look into changes such as including more numbers and looking into investments in other companies that might not be socially responsible.</p>\n<p>“Maybe we could include other countries as well,” Anderson said. “If we are focusing of Palestine then why can’t we add the other companies that we are invested in the other countries and not just focus on Israel?”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year feminist studies and history double major Proxy Senator Andrew Farkash said he supported the resolution as a way for the university to dissociate from a stance that favors one country over another.</p>\n<p>“Our investments as they are right now value Israeli lives over Palestinian lives,” Farkash said. “I think that taking our money out of this issue makes a statement that we don’t support human rights violations, but at some point it is just saying we don’t want our hands involved whatsoever.”</p>\n<p>According to Farkash, it was hard for him to come out as a Jewish student in support of the bill.</p>\n<p>“It is difficult for me to sit here and say that I support this resolution, because I know and acknowledge and am so deeply connected to those histories,” Farkash said. “There are thousands of Jewish people like me who are coming out and saying we love our country, we love our ethnicity, we love our religion, but we don’t love the occupation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

According to a statement released by the SB County Sheriff’s Office, all seven businesses are subject to a fine of up to $3,000 each. Minor decoy programs involve ABC- and Sheriff-contracted individuals under the age of 21 attempting to purchase alcohol from businesses with liquor licenses.</p>\n<p>Some businesses did not check identification, while others checked identification and still sold alcohol to customers despite minor status, according to officials with the Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>The SB County Sheriff’s Office recently received a $50,000 grant from ABC to address the high percentage of alcohol related crimes in the I.V. and Goleta area.

The victim sustained knife injuries to the chest and head and was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital for treatment, where he is currently stable. Following the incident, Ruiz was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, a felony subject to up to four years in state prison and a maximum $10,000 fine, and bail has been set at $30,000.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega president and third-year psychology and economics major Jason Ouyang said Ruiz was heavily intoxicated and was accompanied by a “female accomplice,” both of whom approached the fraternity and demanded entry to a private gathering at the house.</p>\n<p>“We were having a small get-together, ourselves and our friends, and this person was not allowed entry into our house,” Ouyang said. “The guy was very aggressive and probably under the influence of alcohol … my brothers wouldn’t let him come in and he took that very personally and he tried to start a fight … he pulled out some sort of weapon and gave him a couple lacerations.”</p>\n<p>Sheriff’s Office officials denied requests for additional information on the incident.</p>\n<p>Ouyang said the incident was unprecedented and the fraternity never has issues keeping people from coming into private gatherings.</p>\n<p>“In this situation I guess that person wasn’t gonna take no for an answer,” Ouyang said. “Usually there’s never problems like this; this is the very first time something to this has occurred — its a little traumatizing.”</p>\n<p>According to Ouyang, the fraternity would gather in the next few days to assess the situation and focus on the group.</p>\n<p>“We’re all just kinda shaken by it but at the same time we can’t let that deter us,” Ouyang said.</p>\n<p>Sigma Chi Omega is a multicultural social fraternity and part of the Multicultural Greek Council on campus.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office is requesting that anyone with information contact Isla Vista Foot Patrol investigators at (805) 683-2724, or in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol office, located at 6504 Trigo Road.

Food Co-Op but changed location due to rainy weather. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">During the meeting, forum-attendees discussed the possibility of creating an Area Planning Commission with jurisdiction over planning in I.V., the university’s plans to potentially provide housing for staff in I.V. and the possible creation of an elected “police collaborative board,” responsible for meeting with local law enforcement periodically to discuss law enforcement-related issues in I.V. </span></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In regard to the proposed Area Planning Commission, <span class=\"st\">—</span> which would function through the County Board of Supervisors and specialized Community Services District (CSD), if the Special District is approved and passed <span class=\"st\">—</span> Abboud said the commission would approve building projects and their regulations as either a potential function of the CSD or possibly the CSD itself.<br>\n</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Schunk, I.V.’s historical divide between students and non-student residents has caused a disconnect that has led to I.V. becoming an unsafe neighborhood that disenfranchises many residents.

It is only able to provide services,” Freeman said. “All the things that regularly plague I.V. require legislation to fix, not services. The things that CSD can provide don’t go far enough.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The forum concluded with attendees agreeing that information about I.V. self-governance and its related meetings should be better disseminated and advertised to residents, such as students and Latino families, via back-to-back forums held in areas residents feel comfortable meeting. The next I.V. self-governance town hall meeting will be hosted shortly after Schunk takes office. </span></span></p>\n<p><em><strong>[Correction 11/17/14:</strong> An earlier version of this article stated that, during the Nov 14 meeting, “attendees discussed the possibility of creating an Area Planning Committee to allow affordable housing options in I.V. to non-students— primarily university staff” when in fact the Area Planning Commission only gives jurisdiction over planning in I.V., not over what kind of housing the university provides. Also, the plan to provide housing for UCSB staff in I.V. is not related to self-governance and is in fact solely a function and idea of the University.</em></p>\n<p><em> In addition, an earlier version of this article stated that “Abboud said the [Area Planning Committee]’s potential implementation would likely be through the university and would be responsible for infrastructure maintenance and the distribution of student and non-student residents throughout I.V.” when in fact the Area Planning Commission would function through the County Board of Supervisors and potential future Special District and would not be responsible for infrastructure maintenance. It also has nothing to do with the university. </em></p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus <em>regrets these errors.]</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

today that the Board would consider a plan to incrementally increase tuition by five percent annually for five years at its bi-monthly meeting on Nov 19.</p>\n<p>The plan assumes that the state will increase its base budget support for UC by four percent annually through the 2019-2020 academic year, contributions that will amount to roughly 1.7 percent of the UC’s annual budget.</p>\n<p>A UCOP statement stated that the proposed five percent annual increase is a “ceiling figure” and that the entire proposal hinges on the amount of money appropriated to the UC budget by Sacramento. According to UCOP, the plan stipulates each five percent increase would equate to roughly $500 more in additional charges each year and would result in baseline UC tuition totaling $15,564 per student per year by the 2019-2020 academic year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCOP listed various reasons for the tuition increase in its initial statement on the proposal.

University of California students have been ready, willing, and urging the UC to let students be a part of planning for their future.”</p>\n<p>Napolitano, when asked about the statement, said continuing a tuition freeze with current levels of state support, which she said has declined over the last decade by 27 percent per student, is not feasible.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s unfortunate language. It’s not that at all,” Napolitano said. “It’s not holding anybody hostage, this is where we are … but you can’t have a tuition freeze indefinitely at the current level of state support that we’re receiving.”</p>\n<p>According to Napolitano, given the “dramatically reduced” per student contribution by the state, the UC has been placed in a situation that necessitates a tuition increase or an increase in state funding.</p>\n<p>“The per-student contribution by the state has really been dramatically reduced. I think it’s time to say, ‘Look, we want to maintain ourself as open and accessible, maintain our student aid policy; we want to increase California enrollment and we need to invest in academic quality.’” Napolitano said. “At some point you either increase the state contribution or you have a tuition plan that goes into place.”</p>\n<p>All 10 UC chancellors, including Chancellor Henry T. Yang, also released a joint statement today in support of the proposed increase, citing continuous funding gaps and a decreased budget of $640 million in funds available to UC since 2008.</p>\n<p>“The plan addresses our obligation to students and their families to provide them with the best education possible at the most affordable price. It is predictable and fair, and it allows families to plan ahead,” the statement reads. “It is important to note that under this proposed plan, about 55 percent of our California undergraduates will continue to pay no systemwide tuition or fees.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58059\" style=\"width: 294px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1855482660\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58030\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58059\" data-attachment-id=\"58059\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucop-to-consider-tuition-increases/ucsa-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?fit=800%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,680\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?fit=250%2C213&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?fit=800%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58059\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?resize=284%2C241\" alt=\"University of California Student Association released a statement yesterday condemning the proposed tuition increase, claiming as a step that it holds students' education &quot;hostage.&quot;\" width=\"284\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UCSA.jpg?resize=250%2C213&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58059\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">University of California Student Association released a statement yesterday condemning the proposed tuition increase, claiming as a step that it holds students’ education “hostage.”</p></div>\n<p>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, the UC’s largest workers union, released a statement on the proposed tuition increase, claiming that UCOP has twice the number of employees earning over $250,000 per year now as it did in 2008. AFSCME 3299 President Katherine Lybarger said the UC should reprioritize its available funding toward sources other than executive salaries and should “stop squandering millions of public dollars on oversized executive compensation and outsourcing contracts.”</p>\n<p>“The cost of these misguided priorities has already left UC facilities dangerously short staffed, and undermined the</p>\n<p>California Master Plan guarantee for thousands of qualified students in our state,” Lybarger said. “Demanding more money from students and taxpayers without first correcting the tone-deaf mismanagement that has been a catalyst for UC’s financial problems is a non-starter.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Abboud, at 22 years old, is the youngest trustee ever elected to the board.</p>\n<p>Statewide ballot propositions 1, 2 and 47 also passed, while propositions 45, 46 and 48 all failed by large majorities. Proposition 1, which passed with 66.7 percent of the vote, authorizes roughly $7 billion in general obligation bonds toward water infrastructure projects, while Prop 2, which passed with 68.8 percent of the vote, amends the California Constitution to require annual transfer of state general fund revenues to a “budget stabilization account,” with half the funds to be used to pay off state debts while the other half will be used in the case of “emergencies” or budget deficits. Prop 47, which passed with 58.4 percent of the vote, reduced the penalties for certain drug crimes from felonies to misdemeanors.</p>\n<p>Proposition 45, which requires the state’s Insurance Commissioner’s approval before a health insurer can change its rates, failed to get more than 40.1 percent of the vote. Proposition 46, which required drug testing for physicians, also went down with 67.2 percent of voters saying no.</p>\n<p>In national elections, the Republicans picked up seven seats in the U.S. Senate, gaining a majority in that house for the party for the first time since 2007. The GOP also picked up 13 seats in the House of Representatives, placing majorities in both houses of Congress in control of the Republicans.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57929\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57929\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-05/2014-midterm-election-results-capps-williams-re-elected-gop-takes-senate/","id":3438,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3437,3436,3435],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":7,"highestPage":8,"route":"/authors/13"}},"__N_SSG":true}
