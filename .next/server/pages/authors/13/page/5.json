Now’s your chance to get up close and personal with one of the bands, The Mallards, who will be performing at I.V.’s First Friday in Anisq’Oyo’ Park at 6 p.m. This event was originally scheduled for April 7 but was postponed due to inclement weather.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>COMEDY DEAL</strong></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In need of some laughs? On the hunt for a good deal? Why not both? This Friday, Improvability will be hosting a “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” themed show, and tickets are buy one, get one free when you say the secret code word: bogo. There are two shows; the first is at 8 p.m. and the late-night show is at 10 p.m. Tickets to the first show are $3, $2 for the late night show. As always, those who go to the earlier show can stay for the late-night show free of charge.
