A couple of salient memories of the time for me include having to tell the women of Tri Delta that they had lost two of their members due to a senseless act of violence. A happier memory is creating the I Heart UCSB Pledge with student leaders that is now read with all new UCSB students during orientation as they receive the I Heart UCSB pin. I will be remembering the students we lost this Saturday while I visit the benches created in their memory, located in the Love and Remembrance Garden that I helped envision and organize.</span></p>\n<p><b>Yasamin Salari — 2020-21 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista has been the first place I’ve felt at home since I moved to the U.S. The vibrant sense of community, the friends who have supported me through all my ups and downs in the past three years and the mere beauty of our campus are just a few reasons I’ve felt so welcomed here. Our beautiful town has also endured great hardships. I was only a freshman in high school when the May 23, 2014 tragedy occurred in I.V., but my brother was a student at UCSB at that time and I remember so distinctly the sense of grief that took over my family that night. Although it was the immense sense of grief that brought together our community at first, we have continued to commemorate this day by remembering and honoring the lives lost on May 23.</span></p>\n<p><b>Christian Ornelas — 2019-20 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the last four years, Isla Vista has been my home. It has sheltered me and given me the tools I needed to grow. In my role as the External Vice President for Local Affairs, I had the privilege of developing relationships with the many people that dedicate their lives to making this community a safe and inclusive home for all of us. This special little place by the sea has taught me the value of friends, neighbors and community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I was not in Isla Vista on May 23, 2014, I continue to feel the collective grief shared by our community. The aftermath of that day brought together a beloved community that continues to memorialize the lives lost. We remember George Chen, Katherine Breann Cooper, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, Weihan “David” Wang and Veronika Elizabeth Weiss. If you find yourself in I.V. on Saturday, I invite you to pick some flowers and leave them at the Isla Vista Love and Remembrance Garden adjacent to Embarcadero Hall in People’s Park.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To all the caretakers of Isla Vista — thank you. Let us never forget about the events that took place in 2014, and let us always remember to move forward with love and compassion in honor of those we lost.</span></p>\n<p><b>Jeike Meijer — 2018-19 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the painful circumstance of being physically separated this year, it is really difficult to come together and mourn in community. We are learning non-physical ways to show our remembrance. This year, I’ll be using virtual ways to send remembrance to the lives lost and the friends and families of the victims. I also will be giving energy and healing to the first responders and community members whose lives were so pivotally impacted on this day of tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will also be stopping by the Remembrance Garden on May 23 to mourn because that has become a place of gathering to honor the six lives lost. George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katherine Cooper, Christopher Michael-Martinez, Veronika Weiss: You will never be forgotten.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spencer Brandt — President of the Board of Directors of Isla Vista Community Services District</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My generation of students was the first to be fully removed from the May 23 tragedy. Unlike many of my friends that I would come to know and love, we were not in harm’s way when shots were fired. I was sitting at my parents house, watching the gruesome news unfold on Twitter. As I scrolled down the timeline, it became clear that the killer had left a manifesto of misogynistic ramblings that provided a clear motive for the violence. Soon, in a reaction to many users arguing that “not all men” held such misogynistic views, #YesAllWomen began trending, drawing attention to the harassment and discrimination that women experience every day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six years later, we can’t be physically together to memorialize the tragedy. But for me, the distance allows time to reflect on May 23 in ways that I haven’t in the past. This year, I’ve been thinking about how, as a straight white male, the tragedy reminds me of the responsibility I have to live out masculinity in a healthy way. Because toxic masculinity was an important factor in the misogynistic “incel” ideology that the May 23 killer professed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is no secret that toxic masculinity abounds in a college town like ours. As an elected official, I spend a lot of time focusing on worst manifestations of it: sexual assault, street harassment and interpersonal violence. And in 2014, mass murder. And while most in I.V. agree that these things are pervasive problems that we ought to solve, there is less discussion about how to promote and cultivate a positive vision of masculinity: one that means loving and respecting others, being honest with yourself about your emotions and desires and taking assertive action to stop unhealthy and harmful behaviors in other men. We owe it to George, James, David, Katherine, Veronika and Chris to have these difficult conversations, and constantly be doing what we can to make IV’s culture more inclusive.</span></p>\n<p><b>Margaret Klawunn — Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I arrived at UCSB in the fall of 2015.  I have been honored to participate in important commemorations of the loss this community suffered in 2014 each year that I have been here.  This year, I am on my way to the Love and Remembrance Garden to leave flowers there in honor of George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katie Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss. I recognize that others were wounded and many more deeply affected by the violence of May 23, 2014. This year, I am feeling deeply the impact of the coronavirus and the social inequities it has laid bare, and this grief and loss resounds with the misogyny and violence of 2014.  It is also evident to me that there has also been some incredible love and light that emerged as this community came together, and I continue to see that strength and power in Isla Vista among students, staff, faculty and residents. </span></p>\n<p><b>Batsheva Labowe-Stoll — 2017-18 EVPLA</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tragedy that occurred on May 23, 2014 in Isla Vista changed our community forever. The immense grief of students and community members sent shock waves that are still felt today. Yet through all the sadness and fear, Isla Vista came together to create incredible monuments in our community. Through hard work and advocacy, we now have a local government that listens and responds to the needs of its constituents. Today, I.V. is a safer, stronger, more resilient place than it was six years ago. We are more aware, more attentive and have no tolerance for hatred and violence. Our community will forever mourn the unnecessary and tragic deaths that occurred that day, but we will continue to be strong and move forward together.</span></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Abboud </b><b>— </b><b>General Manager, Isla Vista Community Services District</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still remember the days leading up, the day of and the days after so clearly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it always feels like yesterday. I knew someone who was murdered, some who were injured and countless people who were moments away from having been in the wrong place. I wasn’t in I.V. that night and had just completed my term as student body president, but rushed back as soon as possible the next day. I still hold some guilt over not being in town when it happened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That night changed me and many others, along with Isla Vista itself, forever. It was actually gut-wrenching at the time to see how Isla Vista was getting the attention it needed only after and because of six people being murdered. Ending the cycle of only supporting Isla Vista after major tragedies was a big reason why we created the Isla Vista Community Services District. I decided to stay in I.V. after graduating in the following weeks to work on this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, we can never forget those who were taken from us that night (George Chen, Cheng Yuan “James” Hong, Weihan “David” Wang, Katie Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss) and not give any attention to the person behind the tragedy. But it’s also important to remember how May 23 is connected to misogyny, white supremacy, toxic masculinity, gun violence, the incel ideology and in a way our broken mental health system. We need to always push against these things locally and beyond as they continue to drive other tragedies around the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, I’m staying home and getting in touch with the people who were also affected that night. I will also take a walk through the remembrance garden at the park.</span></p>\n<p><em>This article will be updated. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-23/mourning-in-quarantine-six-years-since-may-23-2014/","id":4061,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4060,4059,4058],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LIVE: A.S.

The UC assured students that the individual diagnosed has no affiliation with the university. The city health officials reminded residents that although risk of infection is low, there is no medication or vaccine to treat coronavirus, and thus, recommend frequent hand-washing, staying home when sick and not to touch faces with unwashed hands. </span></p>\n<p><b>Wait Times at Polling Centers at Ackerman Union Run More Than Four Hours (<a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/03/03/wait-times-at-polling-centers-at-ackerman-union-run-more-than-4-hours/\">Daily Bruin</a>): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voters waiting to cast their ballot in the Democratic primary faced wait times of over four hours on Super Tuesday.

Now, an additional three fraternities — Theta Tau, Alpha Epsilon Pi and Sigma Lambda Beta — are facing investigation from the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs due to reports of hazing. Pledges of Greek life organizations have alleged both physical and mental harm, as well as verbal abuse, if pledging tasks were not met. </span></p>\n<p><b>Students Rally in Support of Fired UC Santa Cruz TAs (<a href=\"http://triton.news/2020/03/students-rally-in-support-of-fired-uc-santa-cruz-tas/\">The Triton</a>): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students at UC San Diego rallied in front of Geisel Library on Monday in support of the 54 UC Santa Cruz graduate students who were fired last Friday. The rally led to the cancellation of the celebration for the library’s namesake, Theodor Seuss Geisel — better known by his nom de plume, Dr. Seuss. UCSD’s COLA movement took to Twitter, denouncing the university for not canceling the celebration, writing: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSD has an unhealthy obsession with Theodor Geisel AKA Dr. Seuss. The UCSD Library frequently honors his whitewashed ‘legacy’. Although today’s events have been cancelled, this statement by a member of COLA coalition outlines the deep connections between our struggle and Seuss.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-93280\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/this-week-in-uc-news-2-27-3-04/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-93280\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/this-week-in-uc-news-2-27-3-04/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/this-week-in-uc-news-2-27-3-04/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/this-week-in-uc-news-2-27-3-04/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/this-week-in-uc-news-2-27-3-04/","id":3450,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3449,3448,3447],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LIVE: Santa Barbara County Representative Primary Election Results 2020","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2020-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus will be updating this page with live results from the Santa Barbara County Primary elections beginning 9 p.m.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The <em>Nexus</em> will be updating this page with live results from the Santa Barbara County Representative Primary elections beginning 9 p.m.</p>\n<p>We will also be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1235054277929750528\">live-tweeting</a> additional results.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Carbajal is running for a third term re-election for the seat he first won in 2016. He currently serves on the House Committee on Armed Services, the House Committee on Agriculture and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, of which he serves as the vice chair. Carbajal has sponsored 231 bills since his inauguration in 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UCSB graduate, Carbajal previously served for 12 years as the Santa Barbara County 1st District Supervisor. One of Carbajal’s main issues is environmental protection; he serves on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Climate Solutions Caucus, which aims to find bipartisan solutions for mitigating the effects of climate change. Carbjal has also been a strong supporter of pro-immigration legislation, fighting against the Trump administration’s decision to terminate DACA. </span></p>\n<p><b>Andrew Caldwell (Republican):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Caldwell’s campaign is centered on providing better opportunities for workers and small businesses. In 1991, he founded the Coalition of Labor, Agriculture and Business (COLAB), which now has 1,000 members in Santa Barbara County. He has also helped start similar COLAB groups in Imperial, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties. While Caldwell is running as a Republican, he told the Santa Maria Times in February that neither party is serving the needs of the people and that he would “represent the people here.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Kenneth Young (No Party Preference): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young’s background is in civil engineering. According to his website, two issues that prompted him to run for office are health care and tax issues. He believes that Congress needs to lower costs for working families in order to maintain a healthy workforce in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another issue Young has put at the forefront of his campaign is energy independence; he said he believes the United States should invest more funding in renewable energy research and find safer ways of dealing with nuclear waste rather than eliminating nuclear power altogether. </span></p>\n<h2><b>State Assembly:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Charles W. Cole (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cole, the sole Republican candidate running for State Assembly and the youngest among all candidates at 22, is running on a conservative platform that includes fixing freeways, preserving Proposition 13, maintaining private health care and rolling back rent control, according to his campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born and raised in Santa Barbara, Cole graduated from Santa Barbara High School and attended Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) to study business, but left after his first year after he found “the PC culture not conducive to learning,” according to his campaign website. His father manages his campaign, which has roughly $10,000 in donations from friends and family. He currently works for a local PR business, according to a Noozhawk</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Elsa Granados (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados, executive director of the nonprofit Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, is running on a three-fold platform that includes social equality advocacy, women’s rights advocacy and preserving the environment and coastlines along the Central Coast, according to her campaign website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If she wins the seat, Granados told the Santa Maria Times that she would work to increase affordable housing, create more jobs, strengthen the education systems within the district and stop offshore drilling.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Abboud (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A longtime UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista community member,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud, the youngest Democrat in the race for assembly, is the current general manager for the Isla Vista Community Services District and board member on the SBCC Board of Trustees.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud is running on a platform of education reform and free tuition, universal health care, affordable housing and public transportation, criminal justice reform and support for indigeneous communities, according to his campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Cathy Murillo (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current Santa Barbara City mayor, a former journalist and city councilmember, Murillo is running on a platform that aims to preserve the environment, increase access to higher education and strengthen the middle class, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first term as the mayor of Santa Barbara, Murillo worked to ban single-use plastics, set a 100% renewable energy goal by 2030 and continued to employ integrated pest management in the city. She also negotiated a project labor agreement with the city for worker safety and fair pay, according to her campaign website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Jason Dominguez (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez is bringing his experience as an environmental lawyer and a former teacher to his campaign, advocating for greater response to climate change, according to his website. Dominguez has previously served as a Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney and Deputy City Attorney, and he has been on Santa Barbara City Council since 2015. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dominguez was originally running for Assembly at the same time as re-election for the Santa Barbara City Council but lost the election in December 2019. If elected, he plans to expand his work from City Council on inclusionary housing and wants to create a rent-to-own program for tenants. </span></p>\n<p><b>Steve Bennett (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Supervisor Bennett is finishing his fifth term on the board; before that, he worked as a high school teacher and member of the Ventura City Council. One of his hallmark initiatives of the County Board of Supervisors is S.O.A.R., the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources initiative, which was recently re-ratified. Other key issues for Bennett include building affordable housing and alternative transportation, such as coastal bikeways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bennett recently received the endorsement of the Santa Barbara Independent, who said he “holds the dramatic edge of experience” and will advocate for environmental protection. </span></p>\n<p><b>Stephen Blum (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describing himself as a “proud product of public schools,” Blum was a teacher for over 20 years before he served on the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventura County Community College District Board of Trustees and California Community College League State Board. Blum is basing his campaign on small donors and not accepting donations over $100 from any individuals or groups in what he calls a “positive only” campaign, he said on his website. </span></p>\n<p><b>Dawn Addis (Democrat): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addis serves on the Morro Bay City Council and said on her website that her work as a mother, public educator and community organizer guides her actions. She is supportive of climate crisis legislation, aiming to address the climate crisis by expanding clean renewable energy sources. She also aims to increase jobs and small business growth, according to her campaign’s Facebook page. </span></p>\n<h2><b>3rd District Supervisor:</b></h2>\n<p><b>Joan Hartmann </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Democrat): As the incumbent, Hartmann has been serving as the 3rd District representative — which contains Isla Vista, parts of Goleta, the Gaviota Coast and Santa Ynez — </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since 2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and has been a strong advocate for climate change legislation. Isla Vista counts for nearly a third of the population living within the district.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, Hartmann discussed how the Santa Barbara oil spill inspired her to enter into academia, then law and then into the role of Supervisor. She placed importance on UCSB faculty housing, said she is a “huge supporter” of unionized labor and supports regulated cannabis within the county. She has also worked with several members of the Isla Vista Community Services District, supported the creation of the district and has been endorsed by several directors as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>Bruce Porter: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Porter’s second time running for the 3rd District seat. He is running on a platform of investing in alternative energy, “[restoring] balance to county government,” reinvesting in public schools and implementing a “common sense” cannabis policy, according to </span><a href=\"http://bruceporter.org/priorities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter has faced significant backlash in the past few months from Isla Vista residents and UCSB students for his alleged role in the creation of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/rock-the-vote-sb-declared-illegitimate-by-national-org-shuts-down-operations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an organization that allegedly was created to tip the scales in the supervisor race by causing low voter turnout. He did not attend the Tuesday night town hall in Isla Vista, bowing out of the forum four hours before it was set to begin, citing mismanagement on the part of the forum’s organizers. </span></p>\n<p><b>Karen Jones (Republican): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Jones’ second time running for the 3rd District seat, and she currently serves as a director on the Santa Ynez Community Services District. Born and raised in Santa Barbara, she is anti-“big government”, according to her website, and is in support of the Cat Canyon Oil Drilling Project, which the A.S. Senate </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/senate-passes-resolution-opposing-cat-canyon-drilling-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">voted in November 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to oppose. She also prides herself on only accepting small donations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Tuesday night’s Isla Vista town hall, she emphasized her identity as the “only native-born, only Republican” in the race. When asked about the UC COLA movements, she said that she is not a fan of organized labor and said she believes that salaries can be negotiated and worked out without a union. She added that she believes that marijuana should be legalized, but not controlled by the government. </span></p>\n<h2><b>State Senator: </b></h2>\n<p><b>Monique Lim</b><b>ó</b><b>n (Democrat):</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Lim</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ón currently is in her second term as an assembly member in the California Legislature. She is the former commissioner of the Santa Barbara County Commission for Women and serves as vice chair of the California Legislative Women’s Caucus, advocating for better representation for women in government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lim</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ón has pushed for protection of the environment, authoring bills to stop offshore drilling. She has also authored bills in the past two years on health issues, ranging from extending care for those affected by the Thomas Fire to setting a ceiling for anticancer medication.

Spending most of his time in the private sector, Michaels is advocating for reduced regulations and taxes to make it easier for businesses to thrive, according to his website, and supports economic policies introduced by President Donald Trump.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building upon the private sector, Michaels hopes to create more jobs in business, while making California energy efficient by incentivizing and attracting environmental technology companies to Santa Barbara. He also supports reforming health care and supports Trump’s health care plan to allow a competitive market between health care companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels also attributes poverty and homelessness issues to a lack of affordable housing and wage increases for long-term employees. He prides himself on being a fiscal conservative.</span></p>\n<p><b>Anastasia Stone (Nonpartisan): </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stone has not held political office before and is hoping to serve Californians without answering to parties or special interests. Having worked in maternal health care for the past 10 years, Stone is advocating for quality health care for all and intends to create legislation to protect and better women’s rights, according to her website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a former foster parent, she also seeks to improve conditions for foster children and improve workloads to be manageable for caseworkers in the foster care system. Stone said she holds an approach rooted in compassion toward homelessness.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [10:47 a.m.]: This article has been updated to reflect that Hartmann is a registered Democrat. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92910\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92910\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/2020-isla-vista-primary-elections-guide/","id":3698,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3697,3696,3695],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"This Week in UC News 2/06-2/13","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uc-news.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uc-news.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Our column “UC News” showcases the top stories of the week from other UC student newspapers in our weekly print edition and online.\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Interested in keeping up with what’s happening across the UC system?

The protestors formed a large circle, sang, played instruments and gave a series of speeches in opposition to the housing project — while also providing a list of alternative spaces for the project that they believe would better suit the needs of the community. If built, the People’s Park development would provide 1,200 beds for undergraduate students and 75 to 125 permanent living spaces for houseless individuals.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 13, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92764\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/this-week-in-uc-news-2-06-2-13/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92764\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/this-week-in-uc-news-2-06-2-13/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/this-week-in-uc-news-2-06-2-13/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/this-week-in-uc-news-2-06-2-13/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/this-week-in-uc-news-2-06-2-13/","id":3470,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3469,3468,3467],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"This Week in UC News 1/29 – 2/6","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-02-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uc-news.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uc-news.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Our column “UC News” showcases the top stories of the week from other UC student newspapers in our weekly print edition and online.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Interested in keeping up with what’s happening across the UC system?

This is a $110 million increase compared to last year and specifically increases the UC General Fund by $217 million. The budget also includes $84 billion for K-12 schools and $750 million for a new state fund. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz: Continued Striking at UC Santa Cruz (<em><a href=\"https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/01/10/skilled-craft-workers-launch-indefinite-strike/\">City on a Hill Press</a></em>) </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Wednesday, the UC Santa Cruz American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) K7 workers were on their ninth day of striking; they announced earlier this month that striking would continue until the university presented them a contract that delivers “liveable standards.” K7 includes over 50 employees on the UCSC campus, such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters and HVAC mechanics. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UCLA: UCLA Rejects Proposal for Students Experiencing Homelessness (<em><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/15/ucla-rejects-parking-space-proposal-for-students-experiencing-homelessness/\">Daily Bruin</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA rejected a proposal from the North Westwood Neighborhood Council and the Undergraduate Students Association Council, calling it “unsanitary” for students to sleep in their cars on campus. Instead, the administration suggested a “hostel-like” environment where students pay $15 per night. A small-scale version of the hostel program would include 100 beds and could potentially begin as soon as Fall Quarter 2020. The councils also called on UCLA administration to collect more data on students experiencing homelessness. Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck said in the meeting that it is difficult to identify students facing homelessness versus housing insecurity. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine: Irvine’s Housing Crisis (<em><a href=\"https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/01/13/irvines-housing-crisis-how-housing-insecurity-is-affecting-both-students-and-residents-in-irvine/\">New University</a></em>)</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New University looked back on housing trends over 2019, where increasing prices have led to lower home sales and greater housing insecurity for students and low-income people. These trends are coupled with lack of homeless resources, as earlier this year Irvine (along with four other Orange County cities) was sued for mistreatment of homeless people and lack of shelters in the city. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Jan. 16, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92008\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92008\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/this-week-in-uc-news-1-9-1-16/","id":3581,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[3580,3579,3578],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"This Week in UC News","category":"News","subcategory":"UC News","publish_date":"2020-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uc-news.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uc-news.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Our new column “UC News” will showcase the top stories of the week from other UC student newspapers in our weekly print edition and online.\r\n","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interested in keeping up with what’s happening across the UC system?

freshest talent — and local goods — to I.V. The event, sponsored by Lucidity Festivals, is friendly to all ages and talents. The open mic is substance free, but don’t worry, the hosts assure that it’ll get weird regardless. Snacks and drinks will be provided by the Co-op. Come out to 6575 Seville on Thurs. Nov. 21 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. to check it out!</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1036510233383210/\">Closeout” the Quarter with a Band Party</a></strong></p>\n<p>There’s no better way to end the quarter than with a bang-er! Isla Vista’s best and brightest local bands will be bringing the house (deck?) down on Nov. 22. The lineup includes The Framers from 8 p.m. to 8:50 p.m., Tastegood from 9 p.m. to 9:50 p.m., Careless Cub from 10 p.m. to 10:50 p.m. and Closeout closing out the show from 11 p.m. to 11:50 p.m. If you feel like moshing to your heart’s content, come out to 6745 Del Playa on Friday night.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/548201795940421/\">B’Olde FOM</a></strong></p>\n<p>One of UC Santa Barbara’s male a cappella group will be holding its fall concert on Nov. 23 in Girvetz 1004. Not only do they have the vocal chops, the gentlemen of Brothers From Other Mothers will be showing off their swordsmanship, horseback riding and archery skills. Though they may be putting on an old timey show, BFOM will be providing only the freshest tunes — including Joji and the Jonas Brothers. You won’t want to miss BFOM this Saturday from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/529592050952290/\">InterVals: Dead or Alive</a></strong></p>\n<p>One a cappella concert in a weekend isn’t enough, you say? Well mosey on down to InterVals’ free Wild West-themed concert on Friday night. The performance will take place beginning at 8 p.m. in Girvetz Hall and will feature performances from fellow outlaws Naked Voices, BFOM and VocalMotion. Don’t forget your cowboy hat!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/404521056956498/?event_time_id=404521216956482\">Cook a Community Meal</a></strong></p>\n<p>Feeling in the giving spirit this holiday season? Join the Isla Vista chapter of Food Not Bombs on Sunday, Nov. 24 to cook a totally vegan meal for the community, utilizing donation from the Isla Vista Co-op and the farmers’ market. The cooking will begin at 777 Camino Pescadero at 2:30 p.m., with serving at 5 p.m. in Little Acorn Park and cleanup at 6:15 p.m.. No sign ups necessary!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/457336208225808/\">I.V. Open Market</a></strong></p>\n<p>The Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs will be putting on yet another I.V. Open Market this Saturday, Nov. 23, from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. Packed with local vendors, the market will offer a variety of goods from clothing to jewelry to prints.

Well, the UC Santa Barbara Surf Team is bringing both with their Stoked N’ Broke benefit concert on Oct. 20. Grab a friend or five and head on down to 6559 Segovia Road from noon until 5 p.m. for live music from I.V.’s best local bands, as well as a closing set by guests from San Luis Obispo. For just a $5 entrance fee, you will be automatically entered into a raffle to win prizes such as a surfboard, surf lessons and a private photo shoot, among other rad prizes you don’t want to miss. So don’t sleep on the center of UCSB’s stoke and help keep I.V.’s resident shredders in the water and competing statewide. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Carbs Against Carbon</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love pizza? Hate contributing to a massive carbon footprint? What a coincidence, so does UCSB’s Excursion Club! Isla Vista’s resident outdoor enthusiasts will be hosting a fundraiser at Woodstock’s on Oct. 24 from 5 p.m. until 10 p.m. to support the Carbon Fund, a nonprofit leading the fight against climate change. Excursion Club is encouraging all clubs on campus to go carbon-free, and what better way to get that mission across than with pizza?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Beautiful Bodies Clothing Swap</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In honor of Love Your Body Week, the Isla Vista Trading Post (IVTP) will be teaming up with the Women’s Center for another one of their famous clothing swaps. Taking place in the Student Resource Building Multipurpose Room on Oct. 23 from 5:30 to 8 p.m., the event encourages folks of all shapes, sizes and identities to come out and learn all about sustainable clothing practices, as well as how clothing can reflect body positivity. Abiding by the IVTP’s golden rule of “three for free,” attendees will be able to walk away with three free items of clothing. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Have A Laugh!</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embarcadero Hall will be transformed from dowdy lecture hall to hip and happenin’ comedy club on Saturday night, thanks to Laughology, UCSB’s premiere standup comedy group. Highlighting the show will be Trevor Wallace, who is best known for his “ain’t no laws when you’re drinking Claws” viral video in support of White Claws (which earned him a cease and desist order from the hard seltzer connoisseurs).
