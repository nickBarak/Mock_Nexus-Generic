Idle Riot will be playing this Friday night, with Fencer opening for them at 9 p.m. The theme of the night is “Dilfs and Milfs,” so attendees are urged to dress up as their favorite “dilf/milf.” Both are rock bands; Idle Riot is based in Isla Vista, while Fencer will be coming up from L.A. to perform. The show will be held at 6610 Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>FIND MEANING IN GLEANING </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re like me, you’ve never heard the term gleaning before; gleaning is a term that means picking produce from harvest that would otherwise be unpicked and perish. Join Zero Waste Committee, FoodCycling and Environmental Affairs Board for their first gleaning event of the quarter this Saturday from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. They will be taking students to glean in the Montecito community. Carpooling will be arranged.

A light breakfast will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>HIKE TO THE SEVEN FALLS</strong></p>\n<p>Stretch your legs with Environmental Affairs Board on a hike to Seven Falls this Sunday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The trail is one of the easier hikes, spanning three miles and multiple waterfalls. Depending on conditions, there may even be a natural waterslide, WHAT????!!!! Organizers ask that those interested in participating fill out a short Google form that can be found on the event page. Go have fun!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>YA LIKE BRUNCH? YA LIKE YOGA?</strong></p>\n<p>Grab your yoga mat and head over to the Isla Vista Food Cooperative at 9:45 a.m. this Sunday for their monthly event, Beach Brunch Yoga. The event includes an hour-long yoga class on the bluffs overlooking the ocean followed by a light brunch. This month, the brunch will be set up as a “build a bowl” where participants can create an açai bowl with granola and superfood toppings. The brunch theme will vary each month of the year. Participants must pay a $5 fee at the Co-Op from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. any day before the event to sign up. Those who do not show up on time at 10 a.m. may lose their spot unless they call ahead of time.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82734\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/vista-point-freebies-and-activities-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82734\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/vista-point-freebies-and-activities-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/vista-point-freebies-and-activities-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/vista-point-freebies-and-activities-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/vista-point-freebies-and-activities-in-isla-vista/","id":4293,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4292,4291,4290],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":8,"route":"/authors/13"}},"__N_SSG":true}
