A little after 9/11 my cousin was denied a job because of his ethnicity.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 led to an increase in Islamophobia in the U.S. and in the number of Islamophobic hate crimes reported to the police; have you or your family experienced Islamophobic hate, either growing up or at UCSB, post-9/11? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though I nor my family are Islamic, we experienced some generalized prejudice as Middle Easterners. When I went to school as a young kid I received a few comments; kids would call me and my other Middle-Eastern friends “terrorists” in class. For me, it was more of a personal issue than something I dealt with externally every day. </span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 fundamentally changed the way the United States approached national security in several ways, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and a number of added security practices at airports. Has anyone around you (e.g. your parents) spoken about what life was like before 9/11? What was different, to your knowledge? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that the term terrorism has largely come to be associated with Islam. I know this is not the fault of 9/11 alone but a whole host of events leading up to it. While Islamic terrorist attacks had occurred, 9/11 created a deeply personal resentment against Muslims and Middle Easterners in America that had not existed prior. The nation became a scary place; my parents told me that the nation as a whole felt very safe living in prior to 9/11. The terrorist attack instilled a large sense of fear within the nation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Is there anything else you would like to add? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While 9/11 was an extremely tragic event and nearly 3,000 people lost their lives, the event was re-established as a platform for Islamophobia for many years by the media and administration.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>Anna Wheeler ’03, history major:</b></h2>\n<p><b>How old were you when 9/11 happened? When do you first remember hearing about it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was almost 17 and a junior in high school when it happened. I heard about it on the radio when my alarm went off when woke up that morning. A lot of people were really upset at school that day.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have you learned in school about 9/11? Do you believe you were adequately educated about 9/11?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, I didn’t learn anything about 9/11 in school. The closest thing I did learn was my senior year at UCSB, when I had to take a Middle Eastern studies class for my history degree. I focused on American women’s history, so this course was very outside my realm. That course opened my eyes to the history of the region and how it affects our modern day world.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has 9/11 affected your life? Have you or your family been directly impacted by it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest, 9/11 doesn’t impact my daily life. I teach sixth grade, and I do like to emphasize treating everyone with respect regardless of if they look different than you. My husband was supposed to be in New York City that day (getting a fake ID), but for some random occurrence, he was not. A coworker was working in New York City during 9/11, and she was able to talk to some of my students about it. It absolutely boggled their minds that there were no cell phones to communicate.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 led to an increase in Islamophobia in the U.S. and in the number of Islamophobic hate crimes reported to the police; have you or your family experienced Islamophobic hate, either growing up or at UCSB, post-9/11? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up in Davis, and I thought that community was a haven for celebrating diversity. However, Hasan Minhaj and I were in the same class at DHS, and hearing in his Netflix special “Homecoming” about how his family was targeted after 9/11 was horrifying to me. I honestly thought Davis was above that, and clearly, the lowest common denominator showed itself. I currently live in a red area of upstate New York, and I see Islamophobia frequently, sadly.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 fundamentally changed the way the United States approached national security in several ways, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and a number of added security practices at airports. Has anyone around you (e.g. your parents) spoken about what life was like before 9/11? What was different, to your knowledge? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flying was such a different experience before 9/11. You could meet people at the gate, and it was not such a hassle. We could even stand in line in the forward cabin to go to the bathroom! It saddens me that with one devastating terrorist attack and some attempts to create airplane bombs with liquids that America has completely overhauled its flight restrictions. However, guns and assault rifles kill thousands of people on a scale that does not even remotely match 9/11, and yet we have no large-scale changes. As a teacher, I constantly consider how guns may affect my classroom, and I am never afraid of someone of the Muslim faith or the Middle East harming me.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>Michelle McKee ’19, sociology major: </b></h2>\n<p><b>How old were you when 9/11 happened? When do you first remember hearing about it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had just turned three years old. I remember hearing about it ever since I can remember, but not the actual event.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have you learned in school about 9/11? Do you believe you were adequately educated about 9/11?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most I remember learning about 9/11 was in my AP Psychology class in my high school, when learning about PTSD. I can’t recall learning much about 9/11 in my elementary or middle-school years. I don’t know if I was so much “educated” about the events as I was made aware of what exactly happened. I would have liked to learn more about the impacts of 9/11 on the Muslim community.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has 9/11 affected your life? Have you or your family been directly impacted by it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was three years old and in New York (Long Island, an hour outside the city) with my younger sister and grandmother at the time of 9/11 while my parents were traveling in Europe. Both my uncle and grandfather were working in New York City the morning the Twin Towers were struck and are luckily alive today. However, the hours of uncertainty where the rest of my family were not certain they were alive due to the phones not working were extremely traumatic for them and still haunt them today. It was difficult especially for my parents, who were abroad on another continent and could not catch a flight back to New York for days afterward. My aunt’s previous fiancé, the man she was with before marrying my uncle and whom had met my family numerous times, was killed in the events. Although I am too young to remember the actual events, I feel that it definitely has had an impact on both myself and my family in a way that it made us feel extremely lucky to be alive and together when so many tragic losses had occurred that day.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 led to an increase in Islamophobia in the U.S. and in the number of Islamophobic hate crimes reported to the police; have you or your family experienced Islamophobic hate, either growing up or at UCSB, post-9/11? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As my family is not Muslim, we have not.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 fundamentally changed the way the United States approached national security in several ways, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and a number of added security practices at airports.

What was different, to your knowledge? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mother mentions that she was definitely less afraid to get on a plane before 9/11. She was terrified when she had to get on a plane to come back to New York just days after 9/11. My parents mention that security was a lot less strict, but they do not say that nostalgically because they are definitely grateful for the added security measures.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>Tyler Ferguson ’22, political science major:</b></h2>\n<p><b>How old were you when 9/11 happened? When do you first remember hearing about it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was one. I remember hearing about it for the first time when I was seven.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have you learned in school about 9/11? Do you believe you were adequately educated about 9/11?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned that al-Qaeda flew an airplane into the World Trade Center in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001. I learned that they also hijacked other planes across the U.S. I learned that over 3,000 people died that day, and many more firefighters since then have died from cancers and other diseases they have contracted from that horrible day.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has 9/11 affected your life? Have you or your family been directly impacted by it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family was not directly impacted, nor was I, but 9/11 has affected all of us indirectly. Society lives by different standards now, post-9/11. We have stricter security guidelines. We all have smartphones to guarantee we can call loved ones quickly in the event of an emergency. We all live in fear realizing that terror attacks and threats are a real danger facing the U.S. and the world today.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 led to an increase in Islamophobia in the U.S. and in the number of Islamophobic hate crimes reported to the police; have you or your family experienced Islamophobic hate, either growing up or at UCSB, post-9/11? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. Neither I nor anyone in my family is a practicing Muslim. However, having close friends who are Muslim, I have personally witnessed them experiencing Islamophobic hate or racial profiling. A recent example I can think of of racial profiling for two of my friends was when I went to Israel this summer. Everyone in our group who was white got through the Israeli security with no problems, but two of my friends who went on that trip, who are both young Muslim women, were stopped and subject to extra screenings and lengthy interrogations. The Islamophobia and racial profiling in this world is toxic and morally corrupt, and since 9/11 Islamophobia is becoming increasingly more and more common. Since Trump has taken office, especially, I see Muslim people in society being shunned, turned away, and hated. It is heartbreaking. We as Americans need to unite and love one another. We have so much more that unites us than divides us. We are all human beings. We need to unite and fight to end Islamophobia, racism, homophobia, ageism, transphobia and all other forms of bigotry.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 fundamentally changed the way the United States approached national security in several ways, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and a number of added security practices at airports.

You could show up to the airport 10 minutes before the flight and get on no problem. Now we are expected to arrive over two hours early. I understand that it is for security, but it’s shocking to hear the societal differences of pre-9/11 and post-9/11.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>Christine Choi ’20, Asian American studies major:</b></h2>\n<p><b>How old were you when 9/11 happened? When do you first remember hearing about it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was almost three years old when 9/11 happened. I first remember hearing about it when I was in elementary school at age five when we recognized what happened that day with a moment of silence on the PA system.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have you learned in school about 9/11? Do you believe you were adequately educated about 9/11?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve learned that 9/11 was America’s greatest tragedy. I don’t believe that I was adequately educated about 9/11 because I feel like we were just taught that it was a sad event, give our moment of silence and to stay quiet about it. We were never taught any kinds of details or even the true aftermath of how it affected us as a society.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has 9/11 affected your life? Have you or your family been directly impacted by it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family and I were not directly impacted by this event, but the effects of 9/11 can be seen everywhere. We’ve grown up with these strict TSA rules our entire lives, but we don’t really fully recognize why we have them since we aren’t properly educated about 9/11.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>Jordan Curiel ’20, dance major:</b></h2>\n<p><b>How old were you when 9/11 happened? When do you first remember hearing about it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was about to turn three years old on 9/11. I don’t remember the first time I heard about what had happened because I can’t remember a time when I didn’t know about it. </span></p>\n<p><b>What have you learned in school about 9/11? Do you believe you were adequately educated about 9/11?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My memories of learning about it in school are only of the straight facts because every time one of my teachers tried to talk about it, they would get emotional. Some of them became angry and some still had a kind of indignant disbelief, but mostly they would just turn very, very sad. And so we would get the facts, have a moment of silence and continue with our other lessons.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has 9/11 affected your life? Have you or your family been directly impacted by it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My family is fortunate enough to have been far away from the attacks, so we haven’t been touched directly by 9/11. But there’s an ever-present feeling of danger since 9/11, and the knowledge that we will always have enemies out there seems much more real now. Many of the men in my family served in the armed forces in one way or another, and the effects of the 9/11 attacks have really instilled in us that those veterans are heroes for defending this country because we need it.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 led to an increase in Islamophobia in the U.S. and in the number of Islamophobic hate crimes reported to the police; have you or your family experienced Islamophobic hate, either growing up or at UCSB, post-9/11? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, I haven’t encountered any Islamophobia in my life or at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 fundamentally changed the way the United States approached national security in several ways, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and a number of added security practices at airports.

What was different, to your knowledge? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference I hear about most often is in the form of complaints about strict airport security. I’ve only ever been on a plane once when I was five, so I thought nothing of it — TSA was just keeping us safe, doing its job. Then my cousin got stopped at the airport on his way home to see us (he’s pale as a ghost with freckles and bleach-blond hair), and I started thinking that maybe it’s not a routine safety thing. Maybe the fear of attack that began with 9/11 has never gone away because 20 years ago that would have been unacceptable.</span></p>\n<p><b>Is there anything else you would like to add? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Events like September 11, Peal Harbor, the Kennedy Assassination, etc., are things that everyone remembers in perfect detail. Hardly anyone alive at those times doesn’t remember exactly where they were, what they were doing and who they were with when they heard. Our generation felt that in 2016 when we realized who we had elected president. If the biggest shock we’ve had to endure is seeing a moronic millionaire take the government for a joyride, we might just survive this. But I really think everyone needs to remember those who didn’t survive the moments that defined generations past.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><b>Nina Nazario, political science major: </b></h2>\n<p><b>How old were you when 9/11 happened? When do you first remember hearing about it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seven years old. I went to preschool in New York City, and my mom worked in the Financial District.</span></p>\n<p><b>What have you learned in school about 9/11? Do you believe you were adequately educated about 9/11?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes because I grew up in the area, so it was a day of serious respect for the children in our school who lost their parent(s) in 9/11.</span></p>\n<p><b>How has 9/11 affected your life? Have you or your family been directly impacted by it? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After it happened, my mom experienced a little PTSD while commuting to work. But I remember watching the buildings fall from across the Hudson at the Hoboken Train station, so I had a clear view of the whole thing: the body of smoke in the air, the fire at the top of the buildings, then one building being there and suddenly disappearing into a black smoke. That imagery that has stayed present in my mind throughout my life. When I’m in a panic situation, that memory is the first thing to pop into my mind. For our family, it’s given us great sympathy for the people we know who were affected by the attack and lost their loved ones.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 led to an increase in Islamophobia in the U.S. and in the number of Islamophobic hate crimes reported to the police; have you or your family experienced Islamophobic hate, either growing up or at UCSB, post-9/11? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.</span></p>\n<p><b>9/11 fundamentally changed the way the United States approached national security in several ways, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and a number of added security practices at airports. Has anyone around you (e.g. your parents) spoken about what life was like before 9/11? What was different, to your knowledge? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t think life was completely different; maybe air travel, but I think everyone experienced that. I was definitely more aware of a certain patriotic environment, in my classrooms and especially from our teachers and local police officers who would come to visit our preschool. I remember we had to do a lot of random stuff with police after 9/11, like getting fingerprinted in 2nd grade during class, listening to cops talk about safety protocols and talk about what to do if you lost one or both of your parents or if you had friends that did. The idea of “America” did not feel like the white picket fence dream. Really, the word “America” felt like there was an unsaid afterthought “America … Don’t fuck with us.” Since we had already seen the worst-case scenario of a terrorist attack and grew up with kids who had no parents because of it and saw in person their despair, patriotism felt more aggressive in a self-defensive way.</span></p>\n<p><b>Is there anything else you would like to add? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any time 9/11 comes up, my mother talks about a security guard she knew who waited by the street-level elevator at the World Trade Center Station, she took this elevator everyday. A few days before 9/11, he started giving out tips for what to do in an emergency (no one knew why) then 9/11 happened. So my mom and my whole family strongly agree with the conspiracy that the U.S. government was wholly aware of what was coming. Its really hard to accept that and also accept how many people were victims because of a tragic event that may have been better addressed/prevented.</span></p><div

Eco Vista Community will be hosting their first ever yoga class in Pelican Park this Saturday at 10:30 a.m. If you’re a fitness fiend or even a yoga novice, come out and stretch your body while simultaneously growing your community connections! Don’t forget to bring a mat, or a blanket if you don’t have one. Yogis beware: actual seeds may be involved!</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/2259553794285230/\"><b>When In Doubt, Stretch It Out</b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exhausted from the stresses of school? Destress with Yoga Isla Vista’s weekly candlelight flow class. Pop by their studio above Silvergreens for an escape from the stresses of everyday life and end your weekend strong. Set yourself up to finish the quarter in a stress-free and peaceful state of being. If you feel like engaging both your body and your mind, drop by the class this Sunday night from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/363784504503515/\"><b>Toga Party!</b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista’s favorite (and only) annual toga party is back and better than ever! This Saturday, the best of I.V.’s local music scene will be playing a twelve-hour concert (yes you read that right)! The trek out to the edge of town is certainly worth it to dance to some head-banging tunes. Grab your bedsheets and fashion yourself a makeshift toga and get ready to jam out to Careless Cub, The Mallards, Delta Dagger, Odd Army and tons of other talented local bands. Located at 850 Camino Lindo, come make the most of your Saturday and forget about real clothes. Togas are cooler. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/2210695989007770/\"><b>Sick Epic Party Concert</b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have the chance to see a concert for the same price of a Yerba Mate, you simply cannot pass it up. Help support the brothers of Sigma Eta Pi this Friday and rock the night away with an entire night of homegrown tunes. The Framers, Hoodwinker Sunfish, Buildclub, Closeout and ADL will be playing throughout the night, with exact set times available on Facebook. Tickets are $4 presale and $6 at the door.

</b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself with some free time and extra cash this Saturday, April 27, stop by the Isla Vista Market at Little Acorn Park at 6747 El Embarcadero from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The casual open-air market will host local vendors selling everything from vintage clothing, handmade jewelry and ceramics to biodegradable glitter, stickers and art. There will even be services such as eyebrow threading. Over 30 vendors will be putting their goods on display, with some taking Venmo for payment, too. Isla Vista Trading Post will also have their shop set up and will be allowing patrons to pick out three pieces of clothing for free.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1233084290181051/\"><b>Soundcheck </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some say that the best bands are formed solely by chance. For bands playing at the 2019 Band Lottery Showcase, that’s exactly what happened. About a month ago, Biko Garage Funzone hosted an event where musicians looking to form a group could meet up and be randomly sorted into new bands. Now, some of those bands are returning to Biko Garage at 6612 Sueno Road on Saturday from 7 to 10 p.m. to put their new grooves to the test. At least two of the bands are scheduled to play, and Isla Vistans can drop in throughout the night to support some of the newest local music in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/279842549625140/\"><b>Down with Capitalism </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who ever said communism is dead? Definitely not a couple of bands slated to play at Communist Mothers Music Collective this Saturday, April 17 at 8 p.m. Local bands Careless Cub and Aqua Stalin will be providing the tunes for a night of condemning capitalism among comrades. If you’ve got a bone to pick with the system, this is the party for you. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/319398622107660/\"><b>Yoga for the Soul </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mantra Lounge Kirtan Santa Barbara and Yoga Isla Vista host an evening of Kirtan Yoga for community members to gather, shed the stresses of the day and unwind with meditative music. Kirtan is a type of religious performance art, using storytelling and narrating to take participants through meditation, but participants of all beliefs are encouraged to participate. The yoga sesh charges a $5 fee and comes with a complimentary vegan treat. The class will be held at Yoga Isla Vista at 900 Embarcadero Del Mar, Suite D, upstairs from the parking behind Silvergreens. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.earlwarren.com/sbfair\"><b>Fun at the Fairgrounds </b></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As summer inches closer, lots of people are looking to break away from hitting the books and start enjoying all the fun that summer has to offer. For those looking to get started early, the Santa Barbara Fair &amp; Expo is coming to town this week. It’s open from 4 to 10 p.m. on Thursday, April 25; from 4 to 12 p.m. on Friday, April 26; from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. on Saturday, April 27; and from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday, April 28. The fair, which is dinosaur-themed this year, will have vendors, entertainers, rides and all the other sentimental fair festivities. Tickets are $5 to $8 for general admission and $30 for carnival wristbands. The fair will take place at the Earl Warren Showgrounds at 400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

drunk food this weekend and treat your body to the vitamins it deserves. Sponsored by the Isla Vista Food Co-op, located at 6575 Seville Road, you can take advantage of this scrumptious produce-tasting event anytime this Saturday from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. At the event, you’ll find a medley of fresh greens and delectable, locally-grown fruits. We know you don’t take a daily multivitamin, so please, eat an apple.</span></p>\n<p><b>Free Yoga Series</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free yoga, sunshine and the stretch of a lifetime — all at your disposal thanks to this free yoga series sponsored by your Associated Students! The event will take place this Saturday from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. at the Pardall Center, located at 6550 Pardall Road. If you don’t have one, mats will be provided, but please bring your own if you do! All skill levels are welcome, so there’s no shame if you can’t touch those toes. </span></p>\n<p><b>Lord of the Rings Marathon</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your type of marathon doesn’t involve sweat or running, then you’ve come to the right place. This Friday, Magic Lantern Films will be putting on a twelve-hour “Lord of The Rings” Marathon. The showing begins Friday at 7 a.m. and ends at 7 p.m. For only $4, patrons will have access to the entire series, as well as snacks and caffeinated beverages. If you’re okay with a sick stomach and sore eyes, you really must be a fan of Gollum — so don’t let him down! Show your support and let the world turn mystical around you for twelve hours straight (or as much as you can handle).</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the April 18, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87551\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/vista-point-18/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87551\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/vista-point-18/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/vista-point-18/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/vista-point-18/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/vista-point-18/","id":4196,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4195,4194,4193],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"SPRING (BEACH) CLEANING Had a sloppy Deltopia?

Then this might be the right opportunity for you. Set yourself straight this weekend and join the Isla Vista Surfriders in an effort to pick those Natty Daddys out of the sand. The event takes place from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. this Sunday at Devereux Beach. If you know your volunteer credit is going to take a backseat later on this quarter, then don’t forget to bring your volunteer hour form to get credit for all your hard work. If your last weekend was particularly rough, we can pretend that didn’t happen. Weekend one truly started now, just don’t tell anyone.</p>\n<p><b>BUST DOWN WITH BIKO</b></p>\n<p>If you’re a fan of neck cramps and stained white vans, then Biko Garage is no stranger to you. Wacko, Lead, Powerslave, The Dory’s and Cruelty will be putting the noise ordinance to work so you’ll have no reason to wallow in boredom tomorrow night. The event takes place this Thursday from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. and is hosted by Biko Garage, located at 6612 Sueno Road. These fine musicians, from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles, have been shredding strings and breaking cymbals all along Southern California. Beer die is a weekend sport, so burn some real calories tomorrow night and forget that you have a section the next morning.</p>\n<p><b>GET DOWN AND DIRTY</b></p>\n<p>This Saturday, the Isla Vista Food Co-op, located at 6575 Seville Road, is hosting an event that you absolutely cannot scrap. The County Composting Workshop, held in conjunction with the Public Works department of Santa Barbara and the UC Santa Barbara Department of Public Worms, will be teaching attendees how to properly manage their backyard compost. The event takes place from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and will teach you what foods can be composted as well as how to properly compost food. The event is only hosted once a year, so don’t miss out! If you stay the whole time, you’ll also be eligible to win your very own worm-composting bin! Now who wouldn’t want that?</p>\n<p><b>COP SOME FRESH THREADS</b></p>\n<p>Have bad spending habits and a bad eye for clothing? Look no further. Santa Barbara-based collector Andi Mondugno has pre-selected all the lovely attire set at painless prices. Swing by the Isla Vista Food Co-op at 6575 Seville Road this Sunday anytime from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m., and peruse the visually-delectable array of clothes, shoes and accessories. The Lazy Eye Pop-up, as it is officially called, is a great opportunity to freshen up that spring-cleaned wardrobe with sensible threads from up-cycled clothing.</p>\n<p><b>JAM TO (ROCK)FIRE BEATS</b></p>\n<p>Are you a fan of NOVA? No, not the PBS show. NOVA Nights at Rockfire Grill will fill the burger bastillon this Friday from 9 p.m. to 12 p.m. with a medley of dance-friendly music. The event is free, family-friendly and open to all ages. NOVA nights is the perfect alternative to your default Friday plans. Who doesn’t love good food, good music and mediocre dancing?</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/vista-point-17/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/vista-point-17/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/vista-point-17/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/vista-point-17/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/vista-point-17/","id":4190,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4189,4188,4187],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Vista Point: Weekly Goings-On in Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2019-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-7.41.13-AM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Little excerpts of events happening around Isla Vista this week;

Look no further, as this once-a-year opportunity will let you cleanse both your sins and the gnarly, natty-daddy ridden streets of Del Playa. Don’t worry about having nothing to clean – the students of UCSB will keep you very busy. Join Adopt-A-Block and the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Parks District (IVRPD) to help bring the pavement back to life. The clean up will take place this Sunday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. To participate, sign up at the IVRPD office on 961 Embarcadero del Mar. Gloves, buckets and trash grabbers will all be provided to you free of cost. You might not be able to clean <i>everything</i>, but it’s the thought that counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Food Not Bombs</strong></p>\n<p>Food not bombs is back with another opportunity to cook a free meal for your community! Even if Food Network wasn’t your go-to in the days before Netflix, don’t hesitate to dip your toes in the cooking world to make some food for a good cause! The event takes place this Sunday from 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. At 2:30 p.m., you’ll begin cooking preparations at 777 Camino Pescadero. At 5 p.m., you’ll serve food to the community at Little Acorn Park and return to 777 Camino Pescadero at 6:15 p.m. to clean some dishes. They are in regular need of volunteers, so do the community a favor and brandish that ladle. There is no sign up – all you have to do is show up. Think of it like crashing a class.</p>\n<p><strong>Engineers Without Borders</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s be real, we all know Hana Kitchen probably cooks better than your housemates. If you’d like to treat yourself with a meal out, you can easily kill two weeds with the same whacker by showing up to Hana Kitchen anytime this Friday from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. Some of the proceeds of your chicken bowl will be donated in support of the Engineers Without Borders project. With chapters in Rwanda and Kenya, the Engineers Without Borders plan on taking a trip to Panama this summer, so rip those chopsticks apart and get smackin’!</p>\n<p><strong>MAPAS</strong></p>\n<p>MAPAS, or Making Adventures Possible for all Students, is hosting a kayaking event this Friday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Fluency in swimming is recommended, but nobody will look twice if you show up in your floaties. In order to participate, check in at the UCSB Adventure Program station near Campus Point to pick up a kayak and celebrate the start of this glorious Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p><strong>SBKlub</strong></p>\n<p>If blasting Billboard’s Top 100 songs for 24 hours straight isn’t your kind of gig, then SBKlub might offer the perfect Deltopia alternative. If you like food, dancing, the beach or honestly anything, then this event might grab your eye – or your tongue – depending on how much of a palate you have for potluck. The event will take place at Goleta Beach this Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The current forecast is upper 60’s and mostly cloudy – perfect for a potluck.</p><div

Shrunken Heads Production Company, a student-run theatre group that organizes various musical performances, will be offering several showtimes throughout the weekend, with performances at Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at Campbell Hall. Sing along to hit rock songs from the musical including  “Aquarius,” “Good Morning Starshine” and “Let the Sunshine In” while following the story of a group of young friends who navigate the trials of everyday life against the backdrop of the military draft and Vietnam War. UCSB Students and military members can get in for free; students can buy tickets for $5.50 and general admission is $10.50.</p>\n<p><strong>Venom</strong></p>\n<p>If you missed it in the theatres, the film “Venom” is coming to Isla Vista Theatre this Tuesday, Jan. 22. UCSB students can enjoy showings either at 7 p.m. or 10 p.m. by showing their ACCESS card at the door. The movie presents an alternative storyline related to the original “Spiderman” in which a journalist by the name of Eddie Brock contracts a mutant organism while investigating the nefarious experiments of scientist Carlton Drake. Brock struggles throughout the movie to control the raging power and superhuman abilities he possesses while trying to prevent Venom from overpowering him. Be sure to bring snacks along with your friends to enjoy the movie in comfort.</p>\n<p><strong>Pajama Party!</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t let the rain keep you indoors this weekend! A couple local bands will brave the storm to perform live music for I.V. residents. Stop by to see Close Out, a three-member punk, reggae, alternative rock band from I.V. and Peach Gazebo, another local band this Friday at 6666 Sueno Rd. Party-goers are encouraged to come dressed in their comfiest onesie or pajamas to dance the night away in style. Peach Gazebo opens the show from 9:20 p.m to 10:20 p.m. and then Close Out will finish out the night from 9:30 p.m. to 12 a.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Shopping in Style </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re one of those people who still don’t use reusable bags when grocery shopping, you’re still in 2018. Update your shopping routine while learning about the latest in zero-waste grocery shopping from staff at the I.V. Food Co-op on 6575 Seville Rd. This upcoming Wednesday, Jan. 23, from 4 to 5:30 p.m., Co-Op Sustainability Coordinator Allison will provide information on how attendees can reduce their “shopping footprint.” The workshop includes tastings of zero-waste recipes as well as raffles to win reusable water bottles and containers. All participants will leave with a reusable shopping bag, so for that roommate who always asks to borrow yours, be sure to bring them along.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
