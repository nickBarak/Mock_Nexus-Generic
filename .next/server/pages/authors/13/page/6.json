He would have said, ‘Eddie, just finish the quarter, and then do what you’re going to do, but get through it.’”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65476\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"969475541\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65481\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65476\" data-attachment-id=\"65476\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/students-community-members-unite-at-vigil-for-andres-esteban-sanchez/sanchez_stephen-manga-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1444894707\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"6400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sanchez_Stephen Manga-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65476\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sanchez_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65476\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bahta, who was Sanchez’s roommate this year, said he has been unable to adjust to Sanchez’s absence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I woke up every day and I would see his face, just sleeping right there.

Fire Engine 11, which was staffed with one Captain, one Paramedic/Engineer and one Paramedic/Firefighter, was dispatched and responded from their station located at 6901 Frey Way (at Storke Rd.) in Goleta. Upon arrival, Firefighters were met by several agitated bystanders stating that the subject had cut his arm and needed help. Firefighters donned the appropriate protective equipment and approached the subject, where they found a combative male victim, around 20 years of age, being restrained on the ground by Sheriff’s Deputies who had arrived on scene prior to our arrival.</p>\n<p>Our Captain and Engineer assisted with restraining the subject, who was extremely combative, while the Paramedic/Firefighter began treatment and worked to control the bleeding. An American Medical Response (AMR) ambulance arrived on scene. The subject was placed onto a back board and restrained with soft restraints to prevent further injury to himself or to first responders. He was then transferred to the AMR ambulance and transported without delay to Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Our Firefighter/Paramedic rode to the hospital in the ambulance to assist with patient care. The Captain and Engineer remained on scene, at the request of Sheriff’s Deputies, to assist with cleanup at three different locations on Abrego Road. There was a large amount of blood on the street at these locations, which presented a biological hazard. The areas were cleaned with the use of Septisol and copious amounts of water.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Firefighters pride themselves in their professionalism while working with law enforcement and AMR to provide the highest standard of patient care. Our members treat every emergency with urgency and professionalism. Engine 11’s crew on October 11<sup>th</sup> included an experienced team of Firefighters and Paramedics. Every effort was made to provide the very best care and life saving measures for this young man.”</p>\n<p><em>For the original allegations:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/witnesses-allege-misconduct-concerning-recent-student-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/","id":4638,"author":{"id":13,"name":"Staff Report"},"related":[4637,4636,4635],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Witnesses Allege Misconduct Concerning Recent Student Death","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image1.jpg?resize=720%2C647&ssl=1","description":"**This story will be updated as more information becomes available.** A previously published Daily Nexus article regarding IVFP’s account of Andres Esteban Sanchez’s death can be found u...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong><em>**This story will be updated as more information becomes available.**</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>A previously published </em>Daily Nexus<em> article regarding IVFP’s account of Andres Esteban Sanchez’s death can be found under <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/ucsb-student-andres-esteban-sanchez-passed-away-sunday-night/\">“UCSB Student Andres Esteban Sanchez Passes Away Sunday Morning</a></em><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/ucsb-student-andres-esteban-sanchez-passed-away-sunday-night/\"><em>.”</em></a></p>\n<p>Five students spoke during public forum at the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate meeting on Wednesday night to give witness testimonials of the events leading up to the death of second-year pre-biology major Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez on Sunday, Oct. 11.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:40 a.m., two Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) deputies responded to reports of a male subject on the 6700 block of Abrego Road running in the street screaming for help. Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm.</p>\n<p>The five students, Areli Ariana, Ashley Baker, Jocelin Hernandez, Alejandra Melgoza and Marvin Ramirez, dialed 911 following an encounter with Sanchez near their residence. According to the students, first responders on the scene mishandled the situation, mistreating the victim and witnesses based on their race.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College student Marvin Ramirez said Sanchez ran up to him and Hernandez screaming “help!” while bleeding profusely from his right arm.</p>\n<p>“He, like, ran into my arms and I didn’t even have a shirt on, and I felt him and he had a massive cut in his right arm and it was just gushing out blood, and it wasn’t dripping, it was literally flying and it was ridiculous,” Ramirez said. “I knew at the time that it was a matter of time, and we ran inside and tried to get a towel and we tried to take care of him.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez was restless but was not violent toward the five witnesses.</p>\n<p>“He was a little bit out of control due to the adrenaline, so he was running around from one apartment complex to another, but we attempted to stop him. We sat him down several times,” Ramirez said. “Though it seemed like he was violent, he didn’t do anything to us.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double-major Alejandra Melgoza said she spoke with dispatch and “specifically requested” medical assistance, but was not taken seriously.</p>\n<p>“I was the one who called dispatch and dispatch didn’t believe me,” Melgoza said. “When you have anyone who is pleading for help, saying that there is blood gushing out of a wound — when you have someone who is passed out in front of your doorstep with blood gushing out of a wound, I would expect dispatch to hear the screaming in the background.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year comparative literature and psychology double-major Areli Ariana said EMTs and paramedics who responded to the call displayed a lack of urgency.</p>\n<p>“They literally acted like it was an inconvenience for them to do their job,” Ariana said. “We were yelling at them, and yes we were frantic, but who wouldn’t be if they were covered in blood.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, emergency personnel took a long time to arrive, and police officers and firefighters did not act urgently upon arriving at the scene.</p>\n<p>“I was jumping in front of them and just full of blood and telling them to hurry up and they just walked out of the car,” Ramirez said. “When the firefighters got there they didn’t want to get blood on their suit, and I remember Jocelin screaming at them, ‘If I have blood on me, why can’t you get blood on you! Hurry up, we don’t have time!’”</p>\n<p>Ariana said responders disregarded her and other witnesses’ attempts to explain the situation, but acknowledged a white male bystander who began speaking to them after police arrived.</p>\n<p>“We’re all basically persons of color; there’s no doubt that we’re brown. He just completely bypassed everything we said,” Ariana said. “He didn’t acknowledge our presence — he didn’t recognize us. From the moment we started speaking he ignored us.”</p>\n<p>According to Ariana, the deputies who responded treated Sanchez “brutally” without reason.</p>\n<p>“While Jocelin and I were huddled over Andy, we were able to hold him down and to calm him down while the police officers came,” Ariana said. “When the police officers came, the first thing they did was to grab a baton and try to hold Andy down.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year film and media studies major Ashley Baker said the police officers involved in Sunday night’s incident were not held accountable for their “brutal” treatment of Sanchez.</p>\n<p>“This is the third time in my life that I have witnessed one of my Latino brothers pass away and have it be completely erased the next morning,” Baker said. “Instead of having a thorough investigation they wash everything down. It was like a Hazmat — it  was like it never happened.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the officer did not have an emergency kit and approached the scene with a baton in hand.</p>\n<p>“One of the other things was that the cop didn’t have an emergency kit, so when they got out they just got out with a baton. What good are you by then?” Ramirez said. “We asked why, and they just said the car did not have it on them. That’s not an excuse because we lost a life, and you don’t know how important that is but that’s a life, a student life.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said Sanchez’s death is likely due to first responders’ misconduct.</p>\n<p>“This is a fellow student of ours who probably died because of the negligence of the EMTs and the paramedics and the police officers,” Ariana said.</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, Sanchez’s mother was unaware of the situation the next day due to an incomplete police report, in which the witnesses who called emergency services were not included.</p>\n<p>“You don’t understand how hard it was,” Ramirez said. “And how hard it was for the mother when we saw her the next day and she had no idea about what happened because they didn’t take a thorough report and they didn’t include us in the report.”</p>\n<p>Ariana said IVFP did not have translation services available, which delayed the time it took to notify Sanchez’s family of his death.</p>\n<p>“We found out that his family didn’t speak English, so they needed a translator,” Ariana said. “He [the officer] was very insensitive to that and he did not prioritize communicating the sensitive information to Andy’s family.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza also said emergency responders should have access to translation, especially to Spanish.</p>\n<p>“How many Latino/Latina families are out in Isla Vista?” Melgoza said. “The fact that we don’t have translating services is a disgrace.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez said she wants to stress the “racial dynamics and dimensions” of the law enforcement’s failure to address the situation.</p>\n<p>“It looks like two cops running in and trying to restrain the individual. And they criminalized the individual because they don’t know how to react,” Hernandez said. “They recoiled at the sight of the wound because they’re not trained, that is not somebody that is trained to ensure our safety.”</p>\n<p>According to Ramirez, the police officers did not carry out their responsibility to ensure Sanchez’s well-being.</p>\n<p>“This is a student that meant nothing to us, I’m not even getting paid to care,” Ramirez said. “If we have such urgency why don’t they do everything in their power?”</p>\n<p><em>For the IVFP response: <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/ivfp-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">“IVFP Responds to Allegations of Misconduct in Sanchez’s Death.”</a></em></p>\n<p><em>For the SBC Fire response:</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/\">http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-16/sbc-fire-responds-to-allegations-of-misconduct-in-sanchezs-death/</a></p>\n<p><em>The </em>Nexus<em> firmly believes in fair comment and is actively seeking comment from all agencies involved in these allegations.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus. <em>The title of this article was edited to better reflect the context in which the statements were delivered. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate meeting on Wednesday, alleging emergency personnel mishandled the events leading up to Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>Hoover released the following statement regarding the events of Sunday morning:</p>\n<p>“On 10/11/2015 at approximately 4:40 a.m., SBSO Dispatch received a call for medical emergency in the 6700 block of Abrego Road for a report of a male subject bleeding from the arm and running around in the street screaming for help. SBSO Deputies, Fire, and AMR responded to assist.</p>\n<p>The victim, Andres Sanchez, suffered from a large laceration around his right arm, near the elbow.  The injury was later determined to have been caused by the victim punching his arm through a plate glass window.  Sanchez was combative and displayed symptomology of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Sanchez was restrained on a backboard and transported to Cottage Hospital Emergency Room by ambulance. Based on witness statements at the scene, Sanchez had struck the apartment window with his right arm and began running around, yelling and acting strangely.  He was bleeding profusely. Several of the witnesses attempted to restrain Sanchez and provide first aid. Sanchez’s roommate believed Sanchez may have ingested some type of synthetic drug, possibly LSD or K2.</p>\n<p>While at Cottage Hospital, Sanchez became unresponsive.  Advanced life-saving efforts were attempted, but were unsuccessful.  Sanchez was pronounced dead at approximately 6:51 a.m.  Next of kin was notified by Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital Emergency Room staff. The Sheriff’s Coroner’s Unit is conducting a death investigation to determine cause and manner of death.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said fire and medics were dispatched “within seconds” of Melgoza’s 911 call, and deputies arrived within three and a half minutes.</p>\n<p>“I was able to pull up the dispatch log and I can see exactly when the call came in and when it was given to fire and medics,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses’ claims that a translation service was not available following the incident is “totally false,” and deputies do not notify families of tragedies by phone.</p>\n<p>“Foot Patrol has many translators. We have staff and we have deputies that speak Spanish,” Plastino said. “We would never call someone on the phone … we call down to the agency that’s in charge of that area.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he wants to provide “100 percent transparency” regarding the events preceding Sanchez’s death.</p>\n<p>“I am so absolutely positive that we did everything absolutely right,” Plastino said. “I want everything to go to the press because I feel so confident in how we handled this.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said deputies’ demeanor on scene is often misconstrued as harsh.</p>\n<p>“At the moment of the crisis we are the ones that have to do the job, and in order to do that, you have to put up your brick wall … your mental armor to deal with the situation at hand,” Plastino said. “That can come across to some people as being uncaring, unfeeling, unemotional, unsympathetic at the moment.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said although he does not agree with Ariana, Baker, Hernandez, Melgoza and Ramirez, he thinks they are asking “good questions.”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely 100 percent glad that they are asking these questions, that they are questioning the way things are being done, because things aren’t always being done the way they should be,” Plastino said. “In this incident, I disagree with their perception of things.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said witnesses alluded to false events, causing Sanchez’s family “unwarranted grief.”</p>\n<p>“I could care less all day long if they want to question law enforcement,” Plastino said, “but when it affects the family and their grieving process for their son who’s died, then it’s an exception, because it causes them more grief.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, deputies are trained in basic first aid, but are not equipped to handle severe injuries.</p>\n<p>“The first aid kit that we carry is enough to help somebody with a stubbed toe, like a small cut,” Plastino said. “We’re trained in basic first aid, which is something anybody can go get … but it’s not advanced life support … we can apply pressure, we can do CPR.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said it is “frustrating” for deputies to be first to arrive at the scene of a medical emergency because they do not have the means to provide the care needed.</p>\n<p>“We want to assist, but we’re powerless because we don’t have the skills, the equipment or everything else that needs to be done during a major incident like that,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino said he agrees with the witnesses that all police vehicles should contain an emergency kit.</p>\n<p>“Here is where we need to do a better job — there was a criticism that we did not carry a first aid kit,” Platino said. “That’s gonna be addressed … Every single one of [our] cars needs to have a first aid kit.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, one of the two IVFP deputies who responded had a flashlight when approaching Sanchez, but the allegation that a deputy carried a baton is “absolutely untrue.”</p>\n<p>“One of them got out with a flashlight, and the flashlights are not very big, so I don’t know how that could have been construed as a baton. The batons are long,” Plastino said. “That flashlight was never used in any way to restrain the young man, it was never used against anybody that was a bystander. It wasn’t used at all.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said he is “very impressed” with the witnesses’ response when Sanchez approached them.</p>\n<p>“There was a woman who was assisting, trying to keep him down, because he was trying to get up,” Plastino said. “Hats off to those who assisted him because with blood loss, the more worked up you are, the more blood you can lose. They were absolutely doing the best job they could as bystanders.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said the deputies’ behavior alleged in the witnesses’ accounts can “not be tolerated,” and he asks for evidence that such misconduct occurred.</p>\n<p>“Whoever is propagating that kind of nonsense, I would ask them to come forward and provide proof of it,” Plastino said. “If there is proof of it, we need to have a full-blown investigation.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, officers will meet with the Sanchez family today to ensure the two deputies did everything in their power when addressing the situation.</p>\n<p>“The sheriff is meeting actually with the family today and going to show them everything so that they can rest assured that we handled their son properly,” Plastino said, “that he was not mistreated in any way, that no part of this was mistreatment of their son.”</p>\n<p>[<em>Correction: This article previously stated San Diego deputies notified the Sanchez family of Andres Sanchez’s death; however, it was Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital that did so.

Upon arrival, deputies were flagged down by a nearby witness who stated the male subject, later identified as UCSB student Andres “Andy” Esteban Sanchez, had a deep laceration on his right arm. When deputies first made contact with Esteban Sanchez, he was being held down by three people. One deputy removed the blanket wrapped around Esteban Sanchez’s wound and revealed a cut approximately three-quarter inches in diameter around his arm. The deputy reapplied the blanket and attempted to restrain Esteban Sanchez. Medics arrived, secured Esteban Sanchez and transported him to SB Cottage Hospital.</p>\n<p>Esteban Sanchez’s roommate said he had seen the victim earlier in the evening when he rushed into their apartment talking gibberish. One of the reporting officers visited the address, where the subject had punched through a window and cut his arm on the glass.</p>\n<p>The deputy contacted SB Cottage Hospital and provided Esteban Sanchez’s personal information. Hospital staff advised Esteban Sanchez was in surgery and may not survive. At approximately 6:51 a.m., SB Cottage Hospital staff reported Esteban Sanchez had died as a result of blood loss.
