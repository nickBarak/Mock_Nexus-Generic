(The special can be accessed on Netflix’s YouTube channel, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tR6mKcBbT4&amp;t=6s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The special comes in the wake of nationwide and worldwide protests denouncing the murder of George Floyd and police brutality and systemic racism against Black Americans as a whole, with renewed calls for justice for Black Americans who have lost their lives to police officers that engaged in excessive behavior. It also comes in the middle of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with the first few shots showing temperature checks being conducted at the door and socially distanced seating at the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The special begins with Chappelle recounting his experience with the Northridge Earthquake, a 6.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the San Fernando Valley region back in 1994. He recalls the tremors lasting about 35 seconds, and even for such a seemingly short time, he thought he might die, and it was one of the most terrifying experiences of his life. It becomes harrowing, then, to try to imagine what George Floyd went through in the eight minutes and forty-six seconds that preceded his death. More so, Chappelle uses the moment to raise questions about what an incident like this — an almost nine-minute long murder in broad daylight with multiple bystanders — says about a society in which a man could do that do another man and “not feel like he was going to get the wrath of God.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Chappelle, the riots and protests engulfing the nation and world right now have been a long time coming. He responds to criticism from Don Lemon, a commentator for CNN, who asked why more celebrities haven’t been speaking out, to which Chappelle questions the very need to look to (often </span><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/celebrities-racism-i-take-responsibility-video.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clueless</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) celebrities for leadership, observing that “the streets are speaking for themselves right now.” He also responds to Black conservative firebrand Candace Owens, who released a video refusing to embrace George Floyd, a convicted criminal, as a martyr or hero for Black America. Chappelle angrily counters, stating that he does not care what George Floyd did. George Floyd was simply the man that this grave injustice was committed against, and that is why his name is in the papers. He remarks, in one of the more poignant moments of the show, “we aren’t desperate for heroes in the Black community. Any n***a that makes it through this nightmare is my goddamned hero.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worth noting here is that this is far from the typical material in Chappelle’s standup, yet does perhaps the best job of all his material at communicating how Dave Chappelle, a Black American, feels about the world he has to face every day. With over 24 million views at the time of writing, it’s also a clear symbol of how much people trust and respect his voice. As someone used to seeing aggressive polarization at every turn of the world, it was genuinely astonishing for me to see neither Don Lemon nor Candace Owens get very defensive over the jokes, and actually independently express their honor and joy at being memorialized in a Dave Chappelle special and to reiterate their belief that he is one of the greatest comedians of all time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of trust is rare, to say the least, and doesn’t seem to be something Chappelle takes for granted. He explores this in the special, recognizing that people seem to trust him because the realness of his jokes make people feel like he’s not lying to them. Yet, he points out, every institution that the people are supposed to trust, from the police to the government, lies to them on almost every level. He ponders the idea that maybe it’s time we figured out better voices to listen to and found better ways to get people to listen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s pretty incredible to see Chappelle pack in this many emotions, jokes and meaningful moments of social commentary into a comedy special that clocks in at a little under 30 minutes. If you’ve seen Chappelle’s old specials tackling the material of police brutality (his 2000 special “Killin’ Them Softly” is hilarious and outstanding), it’s really interesting to view “8:46” as a mature conclusion to those same ideas. Rather than adding to his arsenal of jokes on the topic, this special more somberly lays out his grief at the repeated injustices that Black Americans have to live their entire lives in fear of being victims of. Approaching the topic with a unique combination of sensitivity, moments of light-heartedness and hurt resignation, “8:46” makes for some of Chappelle’s most profound social commentary yet. In today’s cascade of conflicting and angry voices, I think his views are, at the very least, a perspective to deeply consider, regardless of your political views.</span></p>\n<p><span

id=\"caption-attachment-93527\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of New on Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his new Netflix comedy special  “Alive From New York,” Pete Davidson is, in a couple of words, over it. In a roller coaster ride of show, he takes (retaliatory) shots at ex-girlfriend, pop star Ariana Grande, shares an eyebrow-raising encounter with Louis C.K. and provides a more blunt response to the infamous Dan Crenshaw debacle that went down at “Saturday Night Live” last year. He’s brash, irreverent and pretty damn funny; it’s obvious that he has major issues, but you also know he’s willing to take jokes pretty far to make you laugh.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, if you’ve ever laughed really hard at someone else’s joke and immediately looked up in concern for their mental health, you have a good idea of what it’s like to watch Davidson in action. It’s an experience all on its own watching Davidson struggle not to burst out into giddy, psychotic laughter between jokes (usually just barely catching himself). You feel like reaching through the screen to give him a hug and make sure he doesn’t hurt himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidson isn’t quite as hilarious as I expected him to be, but he is pretty funny, and also happens to be very likable. Even after years of working at “SNL” and doing stand-up, he comes on stage with the giddiness of a new comic as his eyes dart around the room and his giggles roar into the mic at his own jokes. It can be off-putting to some, but it makes him come across as at least more authentic. If a joke doesn’t land, he just shrugs his shoulder and moves on, delivering the next punchline. His upfrontness, alongside his gruff New Yorker “I don’t know what’s going on” voice, happens to be pretty disarming and enjoyable to watch.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davidson is also very open about his struggles with mental health. His father was a firefighter who died during the 9/11 terrorist attacks at Ground Zero, a loss that profoundly affected him as a kid. In a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJbqiHbusKY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Charlamagne tha God, Davidson talked about how important it is for him to be upfront about his darker periods, where he’s known to hurt himself and go on depressive episodes. His bluntness is a trait he carries on stage, making no effort to hide the fact he lives a life wracked by anxiety. Watching him be this real with his audience is impressive, and maybe even a little scary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To a generation that greatly values authenticity, Davidson’s voice may very well be one of the more sane ones to rise up. The smirk with which he dishes out petty stories and his constant giggling makes it clear that he’s having fun with this whole thing and proves that he does have a voice to contribute to the national conversation around him. This stand-up special is a chance for Davidson to respond and to take shots at people who have annoyed him in the past. It can come off as sloppy at times, but it’s got some really funny moments, and if you’re at all curious about the guy, this comedy special will probably give you some answers.</span></p>\n<p><span

400;\"> </span><em>Sonya Raytburg / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the Mustangs brought an aggressive push that resulted in an early lead, one that UCSB ultimately was unable to overcome. The final score was 11-2, with the Mustangs taking home the championship.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came here to play with some of the best people around and improve my game,” said Miguel Del Real, a second-year student at Cal Poly hailing from Santa Cruz. Del Real has been playing beer die since his sophomore year in high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s my second year coming here, and you know, Santa Barbara’s kind of the place to be for this stuff.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tournament, held at the Kappa Sigma fraternity sand pit, drew a large number of players and spectators. Its host, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dyeislife, was founded in 2015 by Tanner Guisness, a marketing major who studied at the University of Colorado Boulder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guisness said he began playing beer die in his sophomore year of college and discovered his passion for the game through his time in college. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After graduation, Guisness started an Instagram page </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> @dyeislife </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which grew rapidly as he went from college to college and currently boasts over 91 thousand followers. Now, Dyeislife is a business that he runs with his partner Jack Hagerty, a former SBCC student, that manages die beer die tournaments across the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guisness primarily manages tournaments at East Coast colleges such as Penn State and Clemson University while Hagerty handles the majority of the northern California events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re just spreading the gospel of die across the country,” Hagerty said. “We just want to teach the kids what’s good. I mean, look at this energy, it’s so electric.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My goal is to have every backyard set up with a die table,” Guisness added. “Sand, astro, turf? Doesn’t matter, man, I just want kids playing this game. A lot of people think it’s bad because people are drinking, but hey, better beer than chugging a whole handle by yourself, you know what I mean? At least here with die, there are rules and you have to space it out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gusiness and Hagerty also mentioned that Kappa Sigma was instrumental in getting the event off its feet; the fraternity inspected the sand pits to be free of glass and set up the tables up for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reactions to the event were also very positive, with many non-SB natives complimenting Santa Barbara’s locale, vibe and weather, Hagerty said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite playing the game for years, Gusiness still finds himself reminiscing about Santa Barbara: its weather, picturesque environment and — not to mention — the joys of spreading beer die spirit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No one does it quite like Santa Barbara,” Gusiness said. “I mean, look around. Beautiful blue skies, tons of dudes, tons of beer and tons of die sports. It’s a beautiful thing.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Phoenix in the spotlight feels irreplaceable, completely reinventing himself for the role in a way that shapes out to be perhaps the best performance of his acting career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set in the iconic streets of Gotham City — but this time in the 1980s — we see a mentally ill man named Arthur Fleck, played by Phoenix, struggle to find a place in a society that seems to reject him at every turn. Arthur’s condition, one that makes him burst into fits of laughter (often at the worst possible moments), pushes him further and further away from the world around him. And now, with his social services cut and his medication gone, Arthur has nothing — and his journey into insanity begins.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phoenix is undoubtedly the crown jewel of this movie, delivering one of the most Oscar-worthy performances I’ve ever seen. Having said to have eaten little more than an apple a day for this role, he is a frail skeleton of a man in this movie whose hopelessness and deep sadness weigh heavy in his face and shoulders. His eyes fill with pain as he desperately tries to stop his laughter, which is often misunderstood and leads Arthur into dangerous situations with unsympathetic characters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the limp scuffle that defines a defeated Arthur’s walk to a soon-to-be-iconic bathroom dance scene, Phoenix masterfully plays into the idiosyncrasies of a scared child transforming into a sociopathic monster. Inhabiting this role with every fiber of his being, he manages to leave the character with more life and utter insanity than how he found it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeking complete creative freedom, Phillips set this movie in a different universe entirely, one in which the Joker’s life could be honestly and wholeheartedly explored. The slow-burn plot and the graphic violence, however, make crucial room for an origin story that has for too long been lazily reduced to “he fell into a vat of chemicals.” This is the riveting, no-holds-barred character exploration that Batman fans have always wanted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is the ultimate fan service for Batman aficionados who’ve always wanted a standalone movie for the Joker and manages to hold onto the nostalgia and callous insanity that made the Joker such a beloved villain to begin with. It tells this story with the quiet intensity of a crackling vinyl, taking you through a terrifying journey into the Joker’s mind. As you watch that twisted smile finally come to the Joker’s face in the end while Frank Sinatra’s “Send in the Clowns” plays, you won’t be able to look away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9.5/10 – Masterpiece</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Backed with his signature jazzy piano, saxophone riffs and choir vocals, Chance the Rapper delivered another uplifting and soulful album that will please fans and critics alike.</p>\n<p>Is this Chance’s debut album? Well, sort of. He came into the game with three massively successful mixtapes, all of which were released for free to the public with him only making money off touring and selling merch. The first was the hilarious and touching “10 Day,” a tribute to the 10-day suspension he received for being caught with weed in high school. His next project, “Acid Rap,” was a game changer, with Chance addressing topics of drug addiction, losing friends to Chicago’s brutal streets and using music to cope with the harsh, unforgiving reality of being a black Chicagoan. This touching and sharply intelligent mixtape thrust him into the spotlight as one of Chicago’s newest and most unique MCs. He then proceeded to release the beautiful gospel-rap masterpiece, “Coloring Book,” a thoughtful and uplifting record that affirmed his Christian faith. Built on themes of family, community and love for one another, “Coloring Book” also went on to win a Grammy award for Best Rap Album.</p>\n<p>“The Big Day,” Chance’s latest album, follows up “Coloring Book” with yet another victory lap, designed to make everyone from your daughter to your grandpa smile and run out onto the dance floor. It’s a story of Chance’s wedding, telling the tale of a newly-married 27-year-old and a proud father transitioning to family life and dedicating himself to improving Chicago. It’s not as thematically cohesive or consistent as his previous works, as it feels less like an artistic statement and more like a wedding photo album. Nevertheless, it makes you smile enough to let that go.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The album opens strong with “All Day Long,” a cheerful and hilarious track (backed by fantastic John Legend vocals) that sets the themes of the album: Chance’s fame, his family life and his love for his community. This is followed by the beautiful “Do You Remember,” a nostalgic ode to the endless childhood summers in which Chance reminisces over the journey he’s taken to get here. Once again, Chance delivers witty, hard-hitting lyricism backed by the vocals of the talented Benjamin Gibbard. The track feels like something straight out of Lupe Fiasco’s playbook: great lyricsm backed by star-studded background vocals (not surprising given that they both hail from Chicago and Lupe is a legend).</p>\n<p>This project also does a great job of highlighting Chance’s versatility as a rapper. In this album, he bounces through the jazzy opening track with an energetic and crazy flow then slows it down for tracks like “Eternal” and “Hot Shower.” His ability to use his voice and personality to command the vibe of any song has always been impressive, and it’s clear he’s aware of how talented he is.</p>\n<p>Chance is probably the only rapper ever to be this famous before his major label debut. If you look at the biggest hip-hop stars of today and yesterday, from Drake to Jay-Z to Kanye West to Kendrick Lamar, it’s hard to think of any that attained Chance’s level of fame before their major label debut. Chance handles his popularity with grace and a sense of humor, often cracking jokes and framing his social appeal as a deep bond with his fans and community rather than an all-encompassing fame-worship.</p>\n<p>While I enjoyed the message of this album and really like Chance as a person, I can’t help but feel that he’s lost some of the focus that made some of his earlier projects work so well. The thematic focus is fairly narrow, and that’s OK, but making the album 22 songs long seems excessive. In the era of streaming, the idea of an absurdly long tracklist seems to be commonplace, resulting in some tracks, such as “Ballin Flossin’” and “Slide Around,” being weaker and a little less effective than they could be.</p>\n<p>Overall, this is a pretty solid album by Chance. Thematically, it doesn’t quite match up to the genius of “Coloring Book” or the hard-hitting honestly of “Acid Rap,” but it still stands on its own as a rite of passage for Chance into a new life of fatherhood, marriage and dedication.

What I mean by that is that we tend to define moments in our lives not by some sort of objective measure of exactly what happened, but by the way we felt while we were doing it. Instead of remembering the exact details of shows like “Ben 10,” “Johnny Test” or “iCarly,” I tend to remember the way they made me feel: safe and happy, with my bowl of Cocoa Puffs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back on those shows today, I still feel nostalgic about them, but it’s hard for my adult(ish) eyes to appreciate them as deeply as I did then. A lot of these shows are racked with cheesy villains, bleh dialogue and boring, predictable plots </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— so </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it’s hard for me to muster up the same suspension of belief I once so easily could and hop back into a world like that. The nostalgia I feel now just isn’t enough to fill the gap left by this newfound lack of substance, at least for most shows. But there happens to be a very notable exception to this: “Avatar: The Last Airbender.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, I finished rewatching the whole series after many years, and I found myself experiencing many of the same emotions I felt when I first watched it almost 13 years ago: a deep, breathless fascination with the world of the Four Nations and an authentic emotional connection with each of the thoughtful and multifaceted characters. And now, as a semi-adult, I realize just how brilliantly this so-called “kids show” told a compelling and deeply moving story about war, genocide, conquest, honor and most of all, redemption without taking itself too seriously or relying on blood and gore. I truly think it’s one of the best animated shows ever made and a shining example of what great storytelling looks like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story is set in a world in which the people use martial arts to “bend” the four elements: water, earth, fire and air. (In story writing terms, this is a fairly “hard” magic system, in which the rules and costs of using magic are pretty tightly and explicitly defined. Compare this to a “soft” magic system, like the Lord of the Rings universe, in which magic is a mysterious force used by equally mysterious characters with few explicit rules. More on this </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVrnfniQiS8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each group of benders formed a nation around the art of bending their element. Each nation, in a pretty slick story writing move, is designed with characteristics, a value system and culture that centers around the traits of their element. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Avatar, in this world, serves as a guiding force. He/she is the only person with the ability to master all four elements and is tasked with using this immense power to maintain peace in the world. Yet the Avatar mysteriously disappears, and in his absence, an increasingly militant Fire Nation decides to “share their prosperity” with the rest of the world and sets its sights on total world domination. Without seeing any blood or gore, we are shown the results of the ensuing genocide: the entirety of the Air Nomads have been wiped out, the Water Tribe has been crippled and the Earth Kingdom is under heavy siege.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been a hundred years since the war began and the Fire Nation is close to victory, until two siblings, Katara and Sokka, discover Aang, who is revealed to be the Avatar. After seeing what the world has become in the Avatar’s absence and what happened to his friends and teachers, Aang vows to learn the other three elements, take on the Fire Nation and restore balance to the world. Katara and Sokka join Aang on his quest and are pursued all around the world by Prince Zuko: a relentless, arrogant and banished prince from the Fire Nation who’s been told that the only way he’s going to be welcomed home is if he captures the Avatar. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In building these characters, the show gives a deeply personal account to the consequences of war: the shattering of lives, the depth of the human capacity for evil and the ability of a humble and courageous individual to find hope. I could spend hours talking about all the brilliant characters in this series, but I want to focus on two in particular that created one of the most satisfying redemption stories I’ve ever seen: Prince Zuko and his uncle Iroh.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning of the show, Prince Zuko is exactly what he sounds like: a complete asshole. He’s callous, rude and reckless, often willing to cross any lines necessary (including endangering the lives of his ship’s soldiers) to have his royalty restored. He has a completely backwards sense of right and wrong, and on first glance, he seems… boring. Just a typical cynical bad guy with a bone to pick. But the show provides us with flashbacks and tells us Zuko’s heart-wrenching story.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89291\" style=\"width: 665px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2053533590\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89289\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89291\" data-attachment-id=\"89291\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/looking-back-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/zuko/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=655%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"655,486\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"zuko\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?fit=655%2C486&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89291\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?resize=655%2C486\" alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?w=655&amp;ssl=1 655w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zuko.jpg?resize=250%2C185&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89291\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Nickelodeon</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are taken back to a war strategy meeting in which Zuko, as the Crown Prince, sits next to his father Fire Lord Ozai. One of the generals suggests a strategy that purposely sacrifices Fire Nation soldiers to gain an edge in a battle. Without waiting for his turn to speak, Zuko angrily protests, asking how they can consider themselves leaders of the Fire Nation when they are willing to throw away civilian lives for next to nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By speaking out, Zuko is accused of being disrespectful not only to the general, but to the person who called the meeting: his own father, Fire Lord Ozai. To teach Zuko “respect,” Ozai challenges him to an Agni Kai, a ritualistic duel between two firebenders to resolve a fight. At the arena, Zuko realizes who he has to battle and breaks down in tears, refusing to fight his own father. His father sees this as an act of weakness and burns Zuko, permanently scarring his face, as well as banishing him from the Fire Nation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is here that we realize that Zuko’s arrogance comes from a deep sense of shame within him: his whole life, he was told by the world that he wasn’t enough. He is disrespectful because no one ever showed him respect or treated him like a human being. He disregards his soldiers’ lives because he was made an outcast for</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trying to care for them</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That’s why his sense of right and wrong is so backwards: he lost his family, honor, nation and life for</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trying to be good</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always found that the most compelling villains are the ones who you understand. You don’t need to agree with them or endorse their end goal, but if you experience their journey, you can’t help but empathize with them on some level, and both them and the story feel much more real.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, Zuko finds his way back to the Fire Nation as Crown Prince, back by his father’s side. He has everything he thought he wanted: a home, a family and a nation, but he feels distressed and unsatisfied. To get here, he betrayed his uncle Iroh, the only real father figure in his life, who had begged him to look inside himself and ask if this was what he really wanted. These feelings of guilt and unhappiness overwhelm Zuko. After learning of the terrible devastation his father plans to wreak on the world, Zuko realized that this identity of a fierce, proud and loyal Fire Nation prince was an identity that was handed to him and not his own. In pursuing his redemption, Zuko never stopped to consider if the future he was fighting for was a good one, or if he </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even really wanted it</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Zuko went on his hunt for the Avatar, he journeyed across the Four Nations. He didn’t see a world grateful and awed by the Fire Nation; he saw a world terrified by it. He saw the consequences of his terrible actions and the harm they had caused. Zuko decides that no matter his past, it’s his duty to do whatever he can to end the war. In a jaw-dropping turn, he asks Aang for forgiveness and asks to teach him firebending and help him defeat his father. He finds his uncle, and in one of the most emotional scenes in the show, begs for his forgiveness. Iroh, teary eyed, hugs him, saying, “I was never angry with you. I was just sad because I thought you had lost your way. But you found it again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most beautiful messages in “Avatar: The Last Airbender” is this: making mistakes doesn’t mean you’re an unworthy or bad human being. It just means you’re a human being. Instead of continuing to lie to himself and the rest of the world about who he was, Zuko decided to own his mistakes and use the strengths he had to humbly guide the world in a better direction. He wasn’t a hero in spite of his mistakes; he was a hero </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because of</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his mistakes, and what he learned from them. In doing so, he became greater than any of us could have ever imagined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its beautiful animation style to its inspiring story, this show presents to us the brutal consequences of war and ideology, the capacity of humans to do great good as well as great evil and the importance of mistakes and humility. This could have been a much, much longer review, but suffice it to say that “Avatar: The Last Airbender” has a message many of us could really use right now. It asks us to make a genuine effort to understand each other’s stories and not hate others (and perhaps more crucially, ourselves) because of mistakes that are made. Yes, there are awful people in the world, but refusing to let contempt cloud our emotions can be the difference between a broken and a healing society. Overall, I love this show with all my heart, and I’m a better person because of the lessons it taught me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10/10 – Masterpiece</span></p><div

DON’T GO INTO THIS EXPECTING ANY ALBUM. JUST GO. JUMP INTO IT,” reads an Instagram post shared minutes before Tyler, the Creator’s sixth studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IGOR, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was released to the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, this lushly produced and sonically jam-packed project doesn’t feel much like a rap album — although it’s hard not to classify it as one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IGOR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, from its playful features to its thoughtful thematic and lyrical narratives seems to show that it’s a nostalgic, messy and ultimately bittersweet mishmash of emotions. It’s vulnerable and self-reflective, and shows the emotional journey Tyler undertakes when integrating the many sides of his persona into an album — one that is among his best work as a producer and a rapper, in that order.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IGOR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">narrative tells a simple story that feels strangely familiar: You fall for someone and they admit their feelings for you. But they refuse to commit, to go all in. And this drives you insane. You become undefined, and the uncertainty consumes you. You become angry, resentful, frustrated and bitter. Eventually, you come back to your senses, cut your losses and move on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tyler’s adept production skills pick up much of the weight in delivering this blunt and emotionally revealing narrative. His production takes a sharp turn from the beautiful, melodic, orchestral production that characterized his previous project (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flower Boy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and shifts toward a more bass and synth-heavy tone packed with unexpected bridges and soul samples. It’s sonically intense and incredibly different from his other work, yet at the same time rarely feels overwhelming or obnoxious. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every second feels like this is the first big summer album of 2019; one meant to freshly deliver the many emotions it seeks to explore and to cause listeners to quietly contemplate it in a serene space, away from the bustlings of society. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the album’s emotional narrative begins, we see that Tyler is caught up in a bit of a love triangle: he has a love interest going on with a guy, who reciprocates, but just won’t cut off his ex-girlfriend, despite Tyler’s pleas. Tyler is caught in an emotional limbo, stressed out of his mind and overwhelmed with emotions. Angry and resentful, he fantasizes about a “NEW MAGIC WAND” (which he heavily hints is a gun) to rid himself of his love interest’s ex, and falls prey to his own wishful thinking. If only he was able to get rid of this </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one person</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, everything would finally be okay. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most interesting part of this album is the last minute entrance of Igor, the title persona. Tyler’s story, so far, has been one of emotional turbulence, lowkey murder fantasies and paralyzing loneliness. At this point, his desperation to break this cycle is beginning to show. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the seventh track, “A BOY IS A GUN”, which samples the overwhelmingly nostalgic and beautiful “Bound” by the Ponderosa Twins Plus One, Tyler contemplates the nature of said toxic, one-sided relationship. He says, “You’re a gun ’cause I like you on my side at all times / You keep me safe…Wait, wait, depending on, you know / You could be dangerous to me,” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He feels attracted to this love interest, but ultimately realizes that he could be seriously hurt if he’s not careful. He then decides the relationship is not one worth pursuing and rejects the love interest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the ninth track, “WHAT’S GOOD”, Tyler’s heavily distorted voice suddenly departs from the conflicted, meditative mood of the previous songs and is seemingly overtaken by a wild, braggadocious persona more reminiscent of his earlier work, yet tempered with the wisdom he’s accrued. He raps, “Y’all said I wouldn’t go nowhere, took the detour / . . . / If the cop says my name, bitch, I’m Igor!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Igor seems to be Tyler’s way of reasserting control over his emotions by adopting a hyper-confident persona. Igor is also a stock character in much Gothic fiction, usually acting as assistant to all varieties of evil geniuses. He helps Tyler cope with the pain of pushing away his love interest by adopting something along the lines of a newly realized ego, but reality eventually strikes, upon which Tyler muses, “I don’t know what’s harder, letting go or just being okay with it.” Igor, then, seems to be the sidekick persona — the mad assistant, almost —that Tyler uses in order to pick himself back up; the one that provides the necessary emotional support for a broken heart trying to piece itself together again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sonically cohesive and thematically consistent, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IGOR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> succeeds, at once, as a breakup album, a summer vibe album, a skater album and a quintessential Tyler, the Creator album. It succeeds where Tyler has struggled in the past, integrating the bombastic ego of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bastard</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goblin</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wolf</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the musical experimentation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cherry Bomb</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the raw honesty rooted in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flower Boy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IGOR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> depicts a heartfelt narrative with minimal words and maximal musicality and succeeds in creating an album that feels completely different from older works, while still feeling like a type of music that reflects the natural progression of his sound. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-88569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/the-friday-review-igor-by-tyler-the-creator/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-88569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/the-friday-review-igor-by-tyler-the-creator/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/the-friday-review-igor-by-tyler-the-creator/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/the-friday-review-igor-by-tyler-the-creator/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-24/the-friday-review-igor-by-tyler-the-creator/","id":6588,"author":{"id":278,"name":"Aayush Dixit"},"related":[6587,6586,6585],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/278"}},"__N_SSG":true}
