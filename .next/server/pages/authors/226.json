He said the track was originally built in the 1950s and was officially named Pauley Track in 1974 after Edwin W. Pauley, who was a donor to several UCs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pauley Track was “previously deemed unsuitable for competitive use and lacked adequate lighting,” according to the UCSB Department of Recreation’s website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track was reconstructed several times but the tree roots were such a problem the track needed an entirely new structure, Huskey said. The most recent construction project is the first work that has been done on the track in recent years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Huskey, the track was in such bad shape that it had not been used to host an event since 2010. To fix the root problem, a root barrier was placed between the track and the surrounding trees. Lights were added to the track as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The total cost of the track renovation was approximately $2.6 million, according to Huskey. The costs were funded primarily through the “Flip the Switch For Student Recreation” student fee passed in 2013.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The remodeling of the track was one of the three phases in the remodeling of the athletic fields. The other phases were repairing Robertson Gymnasium and using artificial turf on the track, according to Huskey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track is open at approximately sunrise and closes around 11:30 p.m. The track is open specifically for UCSB students, but is still considered open to the general public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John McCutcheon, the director of intercollegiate athletics, welcomed everyone and thanked everyone who supported the “Flip the Switch” vote during the grand opening on Wednesday. He also thanked the Cheadle family and the Pauley Foundation for their financial support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brittney Johnson, a fourth-year on UCSB’s track team, expressed enthusiasm about the renovation to students, student-athletes and donors in attendance and thanked them all for their contributions. She told the crowd about how the team would practice on the previously unfit track and said it was a point of pride and an example of their work ethic to continue to practice in poor conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Practicing on the turf showed the resilience of this team,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margaret Klawunn, vice-chancellor of student affairs, also thanked the donors for putting together Wednesday’s event, which she said was “an unusual project with great leadership.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the event’s organizers cut the blue ribbon signaling the grand opening of the track, students joined by athletes led the way in the first lap since the track’s opening.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The track will be hosting its first event since its renovation next week against the Cal Poly Mustangs on Saturday, April 28.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82634\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82634\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/pauley-track-reopens-after-over-a-year-in-construction/","id":2785,"author":{"id":226,"name":"Phillip Snoddy"},"related":[2784,2783,2782],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/226"}},"__N_SSG":true}
