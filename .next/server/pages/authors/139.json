Not just for the students here at UCSB, but for the entire world. There are millions of people fleeing from a country torn apart by violence; Paris, Beirut and countries all across Africa and the Middle East have been the victims of terrorist attacks; there have been more mass shootings in the U.S. than there have been days; the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>With so much anger, hatred and violence in the world, it’s so easy to fall into fear. But that’s exactly the point of terrorism … to make us feel scared. Because, when humans feel scared, it’s a scientifically proven fact that creativity, empathy, generosity, intelligence, performance and pretty much all higher functioning decreases. We become animals of instinct and reaction, rather than beings of intellect and creation.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66923\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1379591936\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66922\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66923\" data-attachment-id=\"66923\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-12-03/editor-in-chief-sends-his-wishes-this-holiday/emile/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"emile\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66923\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile-1024x576.jpg?resize=700%2C394\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/emile.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66923\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It’s no revelation that everybody is affected by terrorism, whether it’s through the pain of losing a loved one, pain of being scared of attacks on ourselves or pain for humanity as a whole, we all feel it. But the problem is that we have begun to let that dictate how we feel everything. Everyday function is marred by the possibility of danger, so we keep our heads low and try to make sure we have enough just in case, trusting that everybody else will do the same — it’s not our responsibility how anyone else lives, right?</p>\n<p>Wrong. Humans are intrinsically wired for empathy, that’s why we have these things called mirror neurons. If we watch something happen, our brains light up as if it were happening to us. Our nature is to survive, yes, but our nature is also to care.</p>\n<p>I’m not trying to say that we all should walk around feeling guilty that we’re not sponsoring a refugee or anything like that — quite the opposite. I’m saying that everybody can help just by fighting back against the terror that is slowly creeping into our brains. It’s as easy as a smile. Next time you’re walking or biking around, keep a smile on your face. You’d be amazed at how many people smile back.</p>\n<p>Whenever you feel that inclination toward withdrawing into your shell, remember that is not your nature. That is somebody trying to manipulate you into silence, into complacency, into fear. You don’t have to accept the negativity that is being fed to you every day.</p>\n<p>I don’t mean to say you should ignore it at all; you need to see it, to observe it, to understand it. You need to process it in your own way. But then you learn and move on. You need to remember that you can play for one of two teams: fear or peace.</p>\n<p>If you feed your fear, what do you think you’ll notice everyday? Things that make you scared. You’ll live under a layer of doubt, uncertainty and selfishness. You’ll make choices based on what is best to annul your current fear without thinking about the long-term. That’s not an opinion, that’s science. Fear demands short-term rewards.</p>\n<p>So a piece of advice for this holiday season, and forever, is to choose to be confident, to be brave, to be happy for all the small victories and gifts in your life, to be peaceful and welcoming when you can and to handle yourself like you matter, because you do. You never know how far a smile can go. The more you look for the positive things in this world, the more you’ll find them and, chances are, the more you’ll create them.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, just remember that today you are not a victim, and that means you have the power to change things. You don’t need to be a Senator to enact change. Nothing ever stays the same. So ask yourself, are you making the world a happier or darker place today? You have the power to do both, and whether you like it or not, you’re doing one of them.</p>\n<p>Go out and enjoy this holiday season, even with all the tragedy. Enjoy it extra just to show the world that you won’t listen when they try to spook you. Enjoy it extra just because you can. Enjoy it extra because your happiness might just make all the difference.</p>\n<p>You matter, and even if you die tomorrow, you are creating your legacy every day with everything you say and everything you do. Don’t let that scare you, though. You can handle it.</p>\n<p>Happy Holidays from Emile Nelson</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, Dec. 3 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

Emile Nelson and I’m the editor in chief of UCSB’s newspaper, the Daily Nexus. We have been around since 1930, and we’ve been student-run and independent ever since.</p>\n<p>In the past 85 years, we have consistently won top rankings in competitions across the state and, in both 2012 and 2013, we were nationally ranked as a top-10 college newspaper by The Princeton Review. We were the only UC newspaper to receive that honor. But weirdly enough, we don’t actually have a journalism program at UCSB — which we consider to be one of our biggest advantages.</p>\n<p>Because we are not funded or sponsored by the university, we are able to give the students an organic, uncensored voice that does not have to go through any type of university editing. This means we get to do things like publish a story that leads to the resignation of a corrupt chancellor who embezzled over $170,000 (1986, Steve Elzer on ex-Chancellor Robert Huttenback), and the university cannot stop it from being published.</p>\n<p>We also get to do shit like say “shit,” because that’s how some students speak, and we have a duty to respect that creative decision. But the coolest part of being independent is that, each year, all of us get to make the Nexus exactly what we want it to be. All of us meaning the people who work here, sure, but also you, reader.</p>\n<p>We have our history, traditions and our standards, but every day we have the opportunity to make this paper exactly what we want it to be. If you want to see more coverage on this, tell me! If you want to see less talk about that, tell me! If we messed up or continue to mess up, please tell me! I am as much your employee as anyone’s, and it’s my job to make sure that the content delivered to you is as perfect as it can be.</p>\n<p>Imagine the Daily Nexus as your megaphone. If you have something to say — which I sincerely hope you all do — we’ll help you say it louder. And if you want to work with us, there’s always room. We have about 200 people working with us already, but this is a family that is always looking to grow.</p>\n<p>Come visit us under Storke Tower, check out our orientation sessions on September 28 and 29 at 6:30 p.m., enjoy a free carnival and FMLYBND concert on September 22 from 1-4 p.m. in Storke Plaza and send me an email at eic@dailynexus.com.</p>\n<p>So, whether it’s your first time on campus or your last first time on campus, welcome to paradise! I can’t wait to work with you all.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nEmile Nelson</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of the Thursday, August 27, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-27/letter-from-the-editor-emile-nelson/","id":2695,"author":{"id":139,"name":"Emile Nelson"},"related":[2694,2693,2692],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"International Student Alagie Jammeh Risks Life To Speak Out Against Homophobia","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“No one should be denied their fundamental basic human rights because of their sexuality,” Alagie Jammeh posted on Facebook in September 2014.

After posting his views on Facebook, he was cut off from his scholarship, friends and family, and may still lose his life.</p>\n<p><i>The Washington Post</i> quotes President Yahya Jammeh of the Gambia as having said, “If you are a man and want to marry another man in this country and we catch you, no one will ever set eyes on you again, and no white person can do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>Having grown up in the Gambia under the rule of President Jammeh — his distant uncle — Jammeh learned that homosexuality was one of the greatest sins humans could commit.</p>\n<p>“They keep teaching people that homosexuality is evil and bad … They have this big law that homosexuality is the worst crime you could do as a human being,” Jammeh said. “When I got here [California], I see a different story.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64374\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1784699764\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64366\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64374\" data-attachment-id=\"64374\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-28/international-student-alagie-jammeh-risks-life-to-speak-out-against-homophobia/alagie-jammeh-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?fit=1335%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1335,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1437994304\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64374\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3-684x1024.jpg?resize=500%2C749\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"500\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-3.jpg?w=1335&amp;ssl=1 1335w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-64374\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After learning his roommate and good friend identified as homosexual, Jammeh began to question the anti-gay views he was taught in his home country. And, in an attempt to show solidarity with his roommate, Jammeh wrote those 14 words that may one day get him killed.</p>\n<p>Within hours after posting the message on his Facebook, Jammeh received a call from a relative in Gambia saying, “If the government sees this thing, you are dead.”</p>\n<p>“I deleted the message,” Jammeh said, “but it was too late.”</p>\n<p>The comment Jammeh wrote directly contradicts the views of his uncle, the president, and he soon found himself stripped of his scholarship, ostracized from his country and fearful for his survival.</p>\n<p>“Going back to the Gambia is like committing suicide,” Jammeh said. “There are people who might feel sorry, but not really sorry.”</p>\n<p>For months after posting this message, Jammeh was forced to sell many of his personal belongings, live in his own car, shower in the Recreation Center and hope for his next meal, all while continuing to attend UCSB and maintaining a GPA well above average.</p>\n<p>History Department Chair Sharon Farmer taught a class which Jammeh attended during this time, and said she was amazed to discover he was living in his car the entire time.</p>\n<p>“He is clearly a very sincere student, and to find out that the whole time he was in my class [he was living in his car] … He made it through two quarters and didn’t tell anybody” Farmer said.</p>\n<p>Jammeh said during these months he was still expecting his government to begin providing him financial support again, but he never saw another penny.</p>\n<p>“For two months, the money was on the way … never came,” Jammeh said. “When I go to class, I couldn’t concentrate — I kept having these suicidal thoughts.”</p>\n<p>Despite his inward struggle, Farmer said Jammeh was “such a nice guy” who was “very motivated” in his studies.</p>\n<p>After coming forward with his situation, Jammeh began working with the director of the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), Simran Singh, to find a way to continue to attend UCSB and survive.</p>\n<p>According to Singh, Jammeh’s case has been taken very seriously by the administration and continues to be a primary concern of her office.</p>\n<p>“You do not have a student come in and make that up,” said Singh. “It’s gone up the ladder — everybody is aware of the situation.”</p>\n<p>According to David Whitman, the director of LGBT services and the Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity, Jammeh’s case is a perfect example of “how alive and well homophobia is.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t out of convenience or luxury, this man is facing life in prison or worse for being supportive of the LGBTQ community,” Whitman said. “Give this student a penny, a dollar, because he is facing life in prison and he deserves it.”</p>\n<p>Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob said Jammeh’s case is “really a challenge” and that options for Jammeh are limited because of his status as an international student.</p>\n<p>“He’s been supporting people who are gay, which could be viewed as supporting criminality [in the Gambia],” Jacob said. “He would definitely be imprisoned, and I really fear for his health and well-being.”</p>\n<p>According to Singh, there have been many attempts to communicate with the Gambian government through their embassy in Washington D.C., but there has been no response from the President.</p>\n<p>“The ambassador seemed pretty much helpless unless he got help from the Gambian government,” Singh said. “The money needs to be transferred from Gambia.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the university has temporarily allowed Jammeh to continue attending classes while he struggles to come up with funding and also seek political asylum, without which he could be sent back to the Gambia.</p>\n<p>“Right now, the school said they were going to let me go to school for fall and then I have time to work and see if I could get some scholarships from somewhere, and I have also applied for asylum … So it’s 50-50,” Jammeh said.</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year sociology and black studies double major Mohsin Mirza said he looks to the UC Office of The President for its support of Jammeh and believes a community effort is absolutely necessary in supporting Jammeh.</p>\n<p>“It’s a difficult situation, but I’m hopeful that the people can come together and donate to help and that administration and UCOP can take the actions needed so that Alagie can stay,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Through the help of the OISS and other local organizations, Jammeh has secured temporary housing through the summer with local resident Mariela Marin and her family, as well as a job on campus.</p>\n<p>“I can honestly say that [Jammeh] is someone who is clearly dedicated to the journey of understanding his world and others,” said Marin. “We’re just really lucky to have him.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Jammeh’s future remains highly uncertain, as it is unclear where he will live after the summer and whether or not he will be able to continue to attend the university.</p>\n<p>Despite having deleted the original message and Facebook account, Jammeh now has a rainbow flag on his new profile picture and maintains that he is very firm in his belief that the LGBTQ community should be treated equally as human beings.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64375\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1253416888\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"64366\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64375\" data-attachment-id=\"64375\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-07-28/international-student-alagie-jammeh-risks-life-to-speak-out-against-homophobia/alagie-jammeh-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1437994386\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alagie Jammeh-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64375\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Alagie-Jammeh-4-1024x684.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"The Facebook status Jammeh posted defending homosexuality directly contradicts the views of his distant uncle, president of the Gambia.

said. “Freedom is a really expensive thing.”</p>\n<p>Jacob, Farmer, Whitman and Singh each said the primary way to help Jammeh in his situation is through his g<i>ofundme.com</i> account at <a

“He’s just a really fine human being, a fine student and I really want to see him graduate as a Gaucho.”</p>\n<p>Jammeh says local communities have been instrumental in helping him to survive and continue to study towards his graduation.</p>\n<p>“I feel really overwhelmed with the support I’m getting,” said Jammeh. “People helped me without asking any questions.”</p>\n<p>A version of this

to cover the cost of production and distribution and $1 going to the business that sells the sticker. Businesses selling the stickers include Otaco, Hana Kitchen, Kaptain’s Firehouse BBQ, Hempwise and Sorriso Italiano.</p>\n<p>Hana Kitchen and Otaco owner Weston Suh said he started this project to help raise money for local charities such as Adopt-A-Block and I.V.

The campaign is intended to give residents a way to both show their I.V. pride and support local businesses and charities at the same time, according to Suh.</p>\n<p>“I love Isla Vista … and the students here are really proud of living in I.V. and they know they have something special,” Suh said. “As great as it is, I know it can be so much more … Everything takes money.”</p>\n<p>Local charities often struggle to secure funding for their projects, which makes it very difficult to focus on achieving their goals, according to Suh.</p>\n<p>“I.V. is not really a city — one of the minuses is that funding is always an issue,” Suh said. “A lot of organizations have to spend so much time running around trying to get funding that they can’t focus on their projects … it’s kind of a catch-22.”</p>\n<p>Suh said he hopes the stickers will be just the first part of the campaign and plans to expand it if students respond positively.</p>\n<p>“Right now, we just have bumper stickers, but hopefully we can expand to bigger things and raise tens of thousands of dollars,” said Suh. “That’s really the goal … There’s a lot we can do.”</p>\n<p>According to Suh, Adopt-A-Block and I.V. Youth Project are the first charities that he hopes to work with, and more will follow as the program expands.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-63465\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Over the past couple days, fourth-year music major Azeem Ward has gone from graduating senior to Facebook and Buzzfeed celebrity as a result of the enormous following his senior flute recital has gathered.</p>\n<p>His Facebook event page, “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/874090079303714/\" target=\"_blank\">Azeem’s Senior Flute Recital</a>,” has over 41,000 people listed as “going,” and that number is continually on the rise. Following this incredible and almost instantaneous explosion in popularity, an article posted by Buzzfeed helped to rocket Azeem to the forefront of, strangely enough, British media.</p>\n<p>Azeem said this whole ordeal started when he made his Facebook event public instead of private.</p>\n<p>“I guess when you make public events, they go viral now or something. If you read the description it just says ‘please come out and support,’” Azeem said. “I invited like 600 friends, but in the beginning, it was just like 70 people going, and at the end of the day, it was 120 people going and this guy from England, the UK — Damon Poole — was one of the first people to repost and then repost again.”</p>\n<p>Azeem said he doesn’t know Poole and has not been able to reach him either. According to Azeem, the event page “took off” following Poole’s repost.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know him and, at that point, random people started commenting ‘Yea Azeem!’ ‘You’re gonna kill it!’ ‘It’s gonna go off,’” Azeem said. “And then I started seeing the memes, you know, like me on the moon with girls and stuff.”</p>\n<p>All this popularity, though, came from out of the blue, Azeem said.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t do anything,” Azeem said. “One night it was 150 [people attending the event], last night 12k and now it’s like 40k … Just out of nowhere.”</p>\n<p>Azeem said, despite the newfound internet fame that he has found, the recital is really about the music for him.</p>\n<p>“I’m just here trying to do my thing, you know, play the flute,” Azeem said. “It’s a standard flute recital, you know? I’m not gonna do anything crazy.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63464\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63464\" data-attachment-id=\"63464\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-15/azeem-ward-overnight-flute-sensation/azeem_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431606146\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Azeem_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63464\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Azeem_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63464\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With all the buzz following him, Azeem said he has gotten offers from papers and radio stations all over the UK to talk about the experience, and even received an offer to perform another recital at Bristol, which he said he is dubious about accepting.</p>\n<p>“People from the UK newspapers wanna interview me and stuff, and a guy at Bristol, the event manager there, wants me to come and do a recital,” Azeem said. “I wanna see how people react to it first, ’cause I’m not sure they understand what I’m about to do.”</p>\n<p>As a result of this unpredicted popularity, Azeem said he is concerned that his friends and family won’t even find seats at the recital.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna have to reserve the front row for my friends, family and roommates, ’cause I gotta have those people there, you know? Those people mean a lot to me,” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year CCS music major Robert Johnson, who will be performing with Azeem at the recital, said people are traveling from across the globe to see Azeem’s recital.</p>\n<p>“Someone is actually flying in from Britain,” Johnson said. “My friend is picking him up at the airport in the morning.”</p>\n<p>Johnson also said he is trying to change the location of the concert to a bigger venue to accommodate more people.</p>\n<p>Despite his Facebook popularity, Azeem said he is uncertain as to what his future in the music business will bring.</p>\n<p>“They haven’t even really heard me yet, you know what I mean? If people are still interested in me going over to the UK and actually want me to go and do the recital for whatever reason, then I’ll do that — I’d be down,” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>Azeem said he is currently working on composing music for film in addition to preparing for the suddenly-big recital this Sunday.</p>\n<p>“I’m working on a composition for a silent film by Alex Payne that’s gonna premier at the Reel Loud Film Festival next week,” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>According to Azeem, even though he appreciates the newfound fame, he doesn’t quite understand it.</p>\n<p>“My page is getting more likes than the guy who won the biggest flute competition in the world, and people are like, ‘Why?’” Azeem said.</p>\n<p>Azeem’s recital is set to be held tomorrow, May 16, at 3:00 p.m. in Karl Geiringer Hall.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The highly selective SHCD certificate allows the city access to state funds for planned affordable housing developments, according to Greene.</p>\n<p>Greene said Goleta received $3.6 million in “active transportation grants,” that will fund bicycle path and walkway improvements.</p>\n<p>According to Greene, retail and industrial vacancies are both low at less than three percent vacancy, and hotel occupancy increased 13.8 percent over the last year.</p>\n<p>Greene also said an increase in revenue from taxes such as the Transient Occupancy Tax and Sales Tax indicate Goleta’s financial future is bright.</p>\n<p>“Goleta is an excellent place to start and run a business,” Greene said. “Goleta’s overall position is solid and our future is promising.”</p>\n<p>Miller also said there are plans to revamp Goleta’s Old Town and capitalize on the uniquely authentic quality that it offers Goleta residents.</p>\n<p>“We have so many great neighborhoods in Goleta that are already flourishing,” Miller said. “But there’s something that feels like our soul and our purpose when we visit Old Town.”</p>\n<p>President and CEO of Montecito Bank and Trust Janet Garufis said the Goleta business community has played a crucial role in the immense progress the city has made over the past years.</p>\n<p>“The businesses in Goleta are so connected to each other, it is just extraordinary,” Garufis said. “There are so many great things happening in this community and that could not happen without the support of local businesses.”</p>\n<p>According to Bacara Resort &amp; Spa General Manager Kathleen Cochran, supporting local business in Goleta is crucial to the development of the city.</p>\n<p>“I live here, I do all of my business here,” Cochran said. “Community partnership and hospitality go hand in hand.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63471\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63471\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/goleta-state-of-the-city-addresses-town-development-finances/","id":4709,"author":{"id":139,"name":"Emile Nelson"},"related":[4708,4707,4706],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/139"}},"__N_SSG":true}
