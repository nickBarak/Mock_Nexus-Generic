Several onlookers shared with me the opinion that the driver of the vehicle simply failed to see me, even though it was a clear, sunny Santa Barbara afternoon. If by any chance you are the person who was heading south on Patterson Avenue a little after 3 p.m. on Jan. 31 and turned right onto Overpass Road, I’d like to talk with you. And for everyone: Cyclists help keep the price of gasoline low, we share the road with you and we are your friends. Please be ours.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44311\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cyclists-safe-gas-prices/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44311\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cyclists-safe-gas-prices/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cyclists-safe-gas-prices/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cyclists-safe-gas-prices/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-06/cyclists-safe-gas-prices/","id":6074,"author":{"id":524,"name":"Phyllis Sladek"},"related":[6073,6072,6071],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/524"}},"__N_SSG":true}
