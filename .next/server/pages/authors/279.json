The workshops were also recorded so professors could access them later on the </span><a href=\"https://keepteaching.id.ucsb.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instructional Continuity site.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Adler-Kassner, UCSB’s history of teaching through natural disasters and crises turned out to be helpful in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a pretty good infrastructure to support this partly because of the Thomas Fire,” Adler-Kassner said. “We already had the Instructional Continuity site set up, and because we know Summer Sessions A and B and all the sessions in between will be offered remotely, we’re developing more resources.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Instructional Support Team also holds regular online “coffee hours” over Zoom for instructors and teaching assistants to talk about their remote instruction experiences. If a staff member needs assistance outside of these meetings, the support team is readily available for consultation, Adler-Kassner said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we think toward fall and wait for the campus to provide some guidance about what’s going to happen, we’ll of course be there to support that in very proactive ways,” Adler-Kassner added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from teaching support, the UCSB Academic &amp; Staff Assistance Program (ASAP) is  providing mental and emotional health support for faculty. The group, which offers short-term counseling, consultations, workshops and more, is assisting professors in identifying and managing work-related and personal concerns; these resources are available on </span><a href=\"https://www.hr.ucsb.edu/asap\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ASAP website.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ASAP also organized the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 Pandemic Coping Skills Resource Group, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which holds group meetings for staff to connect with each other, discuss and learn coping skills and maintain their psychological well-being under stressful circumstances, as described in an email sent out to faculty by the Pati Montojo, the ASAP manager and a licensed psychologist. The group has also started a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmApjVWytiKQksNDjoZw8g/featured\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube channel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, uploading videos that help viewers understand anxieties related to the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, who supervises academic planning and programming at UCSB, described the shift to remote learning as a “miraculous transformation,” praising the faculty and staff for their dedication to making the online environment possible in just a few weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If somebody had asked us a year ago and said, ‘We want you to transform your whole curriculum to remote teaching, and we’re going to give you a year to do it,’ people would’ve said, ‘Are you crazy?’” Marshall said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Marshall, while instruction for Fall Quarter 2020 remains uncertain, the university hopes to welcome students back to campus for future quarters. However, campus life will likely </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-10/hybrid-course-schedules-single-dorms-face-masks-for-all-preparing-for-fall-quarter-2020-at-ucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not resume to norma</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">l by fall, and UCSB is prepared to continue remote instruction if that is the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Until there’s a vaccine, we’re going to be living in somewhat altered circumstances,” Marshall explained. He described a mixed approach to instruction involving a combination between online and in-person classes to reduce density and encourage social distancing. “Whatever arrangement we can make to have it be safe and effective,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, many </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-24/pandemic-pedagogy-faculty-prepares-for-first-quarter-of-remote-instruction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">professors would rather teach face-to-face</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> classes, but as more resources develop, their classes are slowly becoming accustomed to online formats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a lot of innovative teachers. They’ve also gotten help from their students who I think, in many cases, are more conversant, more comfortable, with technology,” Marshall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adler-Kassner added that as both professors and students adapt to the situation, they’re helping each other create an efficient space for both sides of the screen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s helpful for students when they know we faculty are doing the best that we can and trying to sort of think about things,” Adler-Kassner said. “It’s also helpful for faculty to really hear about the student experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are things that we are learning from this experience that can improve our teaching overall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

that students could stay connected, even as they moved away from campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He knew he would not be the only one disappointed by Chancellor Henry T.

So far, no one has broken any rules; they’re taking it seriously.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said that he aimed to have the server as precise as possible, having users follow a 1-meter-per-block scale and directing them to use Google Earth for measurements. Members of the Discord server have been sending pictures of buildings for references as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first completed structure was UCSB’s signature Storke Tower, soon followed by Storke Plaza, the UCen and the Arbor, said Neumann; the University Library is also in progress. Once campus construction is finished, the project will expand to rebuilding Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann said his overall goal is to build the campus to such an accurate degree that when someone explores the completed server, it feels like the real deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Neumann, the server has been experiencing technical issues due to heavy traffic on the hosting site. With this being his first time running a large server, Neumann has been doing his best to keep members updated on the server’s status, actively posting announcements on the Discord and Facebook groups. Once the technical issues are resolved, Neumann hopes to incorporate a survival portion to the world, which includes player-versus-player elements, and hold weekend events within the server. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the quarter, Neumann said he is looking forward to celebrating a Minecraft graduation with everyone in the community. But for now, the main focus has been constructing the campus in creative mode, a feature that allows users to build freely with access to all the materials within the game, in addition to just spending time indoors and following the state’s stay-at-home order. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93901\" style=\"width: 1093px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-93901\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93901\" data-attachment-id=\"93901\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-08/ucsb-minecraft-server-building-a-home-away-from-home/library-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=1083%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1083,609\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-93901 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?w=1083&amp;ssl=1 1083w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/library.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-93901\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Charles Neumann</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Montero, a third-year physics major and active member in the community, is responsible for starting the construction of the University Library and many other structures in the server.
