First Fridays and featured a wide array of music by female artists, a hot chocolate booth, dancing, live art and a photo booth.</p>\n<p>Spatial art professor and creator of First Fridays Kim Yasuda said she wanted to find ways for people to heal after the I.V. shootings through events that foster positivity and security during weekends in I.V.</p>\n<p>“All that happened in the spring, that was so hard,” Yasuda said. “Knowing that so many students were coming back in the fall and there was just no vehicle for healing … I have always believed that our culture could provide a space for positive engagement in counter to what seems to be the sensibility when a tragedy happens.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said I.V. First Fridays made use of UCSB Nobel Prize winner and materials professor Shuji Nakamura’s invention, energy efficient LED lights, to brighten the block party. The Womyn’s Commission constructed an outdoor lounge in the park, complete with couches and LED Christmas lights wrapped around the skeleton of a geodesic dome.</p>\n<p>According to the supporting coordinator of Womyn’s Commission, third-year global studies major Cassie Rubio, the social atmosphere of I.V. can cause some students to feel threatened, which is why the organization felt it was important to host an alternative event.</p>\n<p>“A lot of times Isla Vista can feel very unsafe and predatory so we decided to create a cool vibe where people can hang out and meet each other but also being conscious about the different issues surrounding them,” Rubio said.</p>\n<p>Third-year film &amp; media studies major Ashley Baker, who collaborated with Yasuda for I.V. First Fridays and photographs the events, said students were at liberty to organize the event in any way they saw fit.</p>\n<p>“She gave us free reign to do anything that we wanted and she encouraged our creativity, which is something that I’m not used to,” Baker said. “When did most professors ask the students ‘It’s anything that you want to do’? We made up our curriculum and activities for this.”</p>\n<p>According to Womyn’s Commission co-chair and third-year comparative literature and global studies major Danielle Maldonado, the event is used as a platform to advocate for women’s rights and representation.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to take this opportunity to empower women, so all of our performers are female,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>Rubio said she hopes to see more events like the block party in the future, where people can showcase talent that is not usually recognized while providing a safe alternative to the “I.V. party scene.”</p>\n<p>“I hope that this won’t be the last block party,” Rubio said. “I hope that more and more venues like this are set up for female performers to be celebrated and shown off to I.V. because we have a lot of talent that doesn’t get enough credit they deserve.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Out of the six plays produced at UCSB in the 2013-2014 school year, four of the plays were written by female playwrights.</p>\n<p>Department of Theater and Dance Chair Risa Brainin said she is honored that the university is a recipient of the ICWP award.</p>\n<p>“We are very proud to be part of this international movement to create a gender parity across the world,” Brainin said.</p>\n<p>According to Brainin, the Season Selection Committee is an organization that goes over and chooses plays to be produced at UCSB. In 2014, the Season Selection Committee made a conscious effort to produce plays written by women, Brainin said. </p>\n<p>Third-year theater major Charles Grant said the 50/50 Applause Award is a demonstration of the Theater and Dance’s program to provide a wide array of perspectives, particularly from “the female voice” which, according to Grant, “isn’t often heard.”</p>\n<p>“It is also great that our department decided to choose many productions that were written by females because it gives power and voice to the female perspective,” Grant said. “It also gives the opportunity for females cast in those productions to be able to tell those stories that need to be told.”</p>\n<p>In addition to her involvement with the Department of Theater and Dance, Brainin was also named presidet of the National Theater Conference this year, a national non-profit dedicated to support for and advocacy of American theater. According to Brainin, there is a Women Playwright Initiative within the National Theater Conference, which she hopes will influence the department on campus. </p>\n<p>Kris Bauske, Applause Award co-chair and ICWP board member, said the award marks a progressive change in theater, placing the Theater and Dance program at “the vanguard of social change.”</p>\n<p>“The organizations that received the award step out of that comfort zones and say that they are going to challenge the audience to become in tune with the voices of female playwrights and help them to progress along so that they are as interested in plays written by women as they are written by men,” Bauske said. </p>\n<p>However, Bauske also said there is still room for improvement, even within organizations that have received the award.</p>\n<p>“We are pretty much evenly sliced. We are about 50 percent men and 50 percent women. And yet the majority of plays being produced are written by men,” Bauske said. “That tells us that society is putting a lot more importance on stories about men by men for men, or that women are just not having the opportunity to have their voices heard.”</p>\n<p>According to Bauske, consumers of art should be more cognizant to producing stories that women will be likely to value.</p>\n<p>“Typically, the storytellers that I have heard are women,” Bauske said. “It’s not that women are incapable of creating the same art that men are. It’s just that people need to become more attuned with the stories that women find important.”</p>\n<p>Brainin said the Department of Theater and Dance will continue to progress and to produce plays that are written by a diverse groups of people. </p>\n<p>“This year we focused more on writers of color. We want to have a diversity of voices,” Brainin said. “We are focusing on playwrights from different countries, from different ethnic backgrounds. We are trying to reach out to all kinds of communities.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Reul, discussed their respective agendas for this year’s special election on Tuesday at a public forum at the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The Student Advocate General is an Associated Students executive officer and acts as a public defender for the students under university policy. The special election comes after third-year CCS literature major Bailey Loverin, who was elected to the SAG position last Spring, abdicated the position because of personal medical issues.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim and Reul addressed issues such as student outreach and the efficiency and productivity of the SAG office.  When asked about the role of the SAG, the candidates stressed different parts of the job, with Ibrahim emphasizing the role of assistance that SAG provides for students.</p>\n<p>“The job of the Student Advocate General is to facilitate communication between the students and the university,” Ibrahim said. “If a student is in trouble for cheating or dealing with harassment, our job is to advise them on what to do. The student advocacy general should be a resource that is always available for students to advise them on whatever issue that they may be having,” Ibrahim said.</p>\n<p>Reul said the SAG should serve as a direct link between students and the university, advocating for students to university administration.</p>\n<p>“We are the only office in the executive that directly deals with the students,” Reul said. “The role of the Student Advocate General is to not only amplify the voice of the students, but also to give them resources to assist themselves.”</p>\n<p>When asked about informing students regarding the Office of the Student Advocate, both candidates agreed on hosting more events to educate students about the office.</p>\n<p>Reul said he plans on continuing the outreach program that Loverin began last year in addition to the casework department.</p>\n<p>“We are going to hire more casework staff to enhance the outreach output,” Reul said. “We are going to host regular events in I.V. and in residence halls to tell people about SAG.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said he also supported the outreach program and discussed other ways to reach out to students.</p>\n<p>“I will let students know that this resource is available to them,” Ibrahim said. “I will definitely utilize Facebook as a platform to get the word out.”</p>\n<p>Both candidates said events in Isla Vista, such as Deltopia and Halloween, have gotten out of hand. Both candidates also discussed the role of on-campus events to deter students from going to I.V., but each are looking for different ways to do so.</p>\n<p>“With everything that has happened last year, these events have become really unsafe,” Ibrahim said. “Whether it is from the presence of people from out of town or the increased police presence that has made people feel uncomfortable. We really need to focus on keeping it local and safe.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said she supported events such as the upcoming concert on Friday, because of their potential to reduce student participation in the Halloween festivities.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Residence Hall Association, Reul emphasized the role that RHA can play during these events.</p>\n<p>“I feel that these events have gotten unwieldy,” Reul said. “We can provide alternatives to these events. RHA does hold events that are not only for the residence hall members but also for the community at large. We can make these events fun and also safe.”</p>\n<p>However, the candidates disagreed on how they would increase the efficiency of the SAG.</p>\n<p>Ibrahim said measures should be put in place to ensure a more productive working environment.</p>\n<p>“There should be a reapplication process to make sure there is a really good work dynamic,” Ibrahim said. “I honestly feel that a good work dynamic can help increase efficiency. Also, assigning very specific duties to the staff because all of the duties are broad.”</p>\n<p>Reul also said he will seek to increase productivity by allowing students new ways to submit their cases.</p>\n<p>“We intend to increase efficiency by reinventing our website to make sure that cases can be submitted online with near-instant response,” Reul said. “We are going to have office hours in residence halls.”</p>\n<p>In their closing statements, Reul reiterated his experience in the OSA, while Ibrahim emphasized her association with numerous organizations on campus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57520\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57520\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/student-advocate-general-candidates-discuss-platforms/","id":2982,"author":{"id":175,"name":"Rishika Kenkre"},"related":[2981,2980,2979],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/175"}},"__N_SSG":true}
