The Gauchos were in search of clinching the No. 1 seed in the Big West North Division standings in their final home match of the season.</p>\n<p>A 0-0 draw was the final result of the weekday game as neither of the two teams managed to net goals during the 90 minutes of regulation play.  Nearly changing the match’s narrative was the forward-to-forward connection of freshman Rodney Michael and sophomore Ignacio Tellechea.</p>\n<p>In the match’s 58<sup>th</sup> minute, Michael sent a cross from the wing of the field to Tellechea, who then struck the ball into the net. Unfortunately, the play was called offside and the score still remained 0-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“If you think about it, that right there was the four, five goals we needed. So, in the end, it just comes down to personnel and the function of forwards [not making plays quick enough and passing] and playing as forwards,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>UCSB is now 6-6-5 and 4-2-3 in the Big West, while Sac. St. sits at 8-7-2, 4-3-2. Santa Barbara came into the match second in the division with 14 points, while Sac St. was third with 13.</p>\n<p>Following Wednesday’s match, no changes took place in the North Division standings as the Gaucho-Hornet stalemate led to one point for both teams, leaving UCSB in second (15 points) and Sac St. in third (14 points), however, UC Davis was crowned the Big West North Division champion after its 2-1 victory over Cal Poly on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The game whistle sounded and both teams were off to a booming start. The Sac State Hornets were the first to strike as Gaucho freshman keeper saved an open shot on goal. This would be the first of only two on target shots the Hornets had all night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then peppered in a couple shot of their own, but besides foul trouble from both ends, the rest of the first half remained pretty stagnant regardless of all the team substitutions. Both teams would end up with a combined total of 33 infractions on the night.</p>\n<p>A standout moment in regulation, was when a Red Card was given to the Gaucho bench in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute, in response to their passionate reaction to what the team felt was a no call.</p>\n<p>As for the second half of play, UCSB went ahead and took reign of possession. This eventually proved to be a recurring theme for the home side as it seemed every following counterattack was called offside as well leading to the Gauchos seventh overtime match of the season, the fourth that went into OT tied 0-0.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were instantly aggressive in the opening minutes of the first OT period, attempting three corner kicks in a row, but to no avail. There was only one shot attempted in the second OT period for either team, and that shot was by senior Kim.</p>\n<p>The lack of playmaking ability from the midfield was prevalent as all key passes from half field just seemed to be swallowed up by the Hornet defensive line. In the end, the end of the game had arrived and both teams settled for the draw.</p>\n<p>“Our forwards are young; they work hard and have loads of talent. But passing is sometimes an afterthought for them. So when they finally get into that situation, it’s too late, which is why we need a guy that can get up the field and make those passes,” Vom Steeg said. “Subsequently, it’s forward passing to forward so these passes end up being too short, too far or behind. Which is when the goalie comes running up at you and you won’t have enough time to run around him or chip the ball over.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this was the case for both teams. Regardless of all the counterattacks and offside calls, neither side was able to pull the trigger and earn the winning goal. Whether it was nerves or just quality defense on both ends, it was a great showing no doubt.</p>\n<p>Senior night was also upon us and some of the Gauchos were about to play their final regular season home game of the season. Players being honored recognized for their contribution to the team included: seniors Seo-In Kim, Omar Montalvo, Josue Salgado, Alex Liua, and Randy Mendoza. Each of these players started or were subbed throughout the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now head away for their last game of the season as they face Cal Poly in the last installment of this year’s Blue Green men’s soccer rivalry beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday, October 28 at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79344\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79344\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-26/scoreless-draw-ends-ucsbs-hope-for-fifth-straight-north-division-title/","id":1386,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1385,1384,1383],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Attempts Season Sweep Over Sac St. in Final Home Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are hoping to shake a devastating 5-0 loss to UC Davis over the weekend in its home finale versus Sac St Wednesday night.

Both teams initially faced each other last Wednesday at Hornet Field, which resulted in a 2-1 OT win for UCSB.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the majority of the first match, both teams were knotted at one goal apiece. In the end, the Gauchos came out on top and handed the Hornets their third loss of their conference schedule.</p>\n<p>Following their collapse against the Aggies over the weekend, the Gauchos’ defensive line will need to clean up its play to put themselves in the best position to possibly win. UCSB will be forced to keep its head on a swivel against a Hornets’ offense that is potent on the offensive end. Sac State currently boasts 11 different scorers on the year, who have combined for a total of 26 goals. In comparison, the Gauchos only have seven different scorers on the team and a combined total of 17 goals.</p>\n<p>More specifically, UCSB’s defensive agenda should have the names of Sac State’s two most productive players – Christian Webb and Justin Bedig – circled on its radar. Midfielder/forward Christian Webb currently still stands as his team’s leading goal scorer with six goals.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bedig found himself doing both scoring and playmaking last week with a goal and assist for his team. Both players will enter Wednesday still with a hot hand approach, as the UCSB defense, led by freshman goalkeeper Alan Carillo, will hope to prevent the two from having many scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>As much as a defensive battle, UCSB’s offense will look for a repeat performance from its last time out against Sac State. In the 2-1 OT victory, it was freshman forward Rodney Michael’s moment as he notched both goals, including the golden goal, to lead the Gauchos to their victory.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’ll be up to the playmaking abilities of sophomore Ignacio Tellechea and senior defender Randy Mendoza, in addition to the hopeful return of sophomore forward Noah Billingsley who was absent in the Gauchos’ lopsided loss, that will be influential factors upon UCSB’s chance of winning in its final bout at Harder Stadium. All three players have contributed to a combined total of seven team assists on the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host the visiting Sac State Hornets this Wednesday, Oct. 25 at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Surprisingly, much of all play remained in the middle third of the pitch with very few attempts on goal or crosses to the middle even occurring. Officiating was also very sharp as several close offside decisions were called. Nonetheless, the Gauchos weren’t yet aware, but they were about to play their closest game of the year. Fortunately, it also turned out to be a significant win for them as well.</p>\n<p>Following kickoff, the first half started out very aggressively as it only took 10 minutes before UCSB was granted a yellow card. This would be the first yellow card out of a total of 4 through the remainder of the game as play was filled with consecutively fierce challenges.</p>\n<p>However, Sacramento State probably would have leveled for a yellow card worthy challenge; instead an ill timed handball within the 18 yard box placed the Gauchos in a dangerous position to score. And score they did.</p>\n<p>The first goal on the day came in the 19<sup>th</sup> minute of regulation time off said free kick, and it was none other than freshman forward Rodney Michael who put his team on top. Michael put his laces through the dead ball from about 10 yards out as the Gauchos celebrated their early lead.</p>\n<p>Yet, soccer is a game full of surprises as the Gauchos weren’t able to bask in this goal’s glory for very long since Sac State started to pepper back at them with attack after attack. Ultimately, it was No. 10 for the Hornets who helped find his team level at 1-1. Sac State junior midfielder Dominic Scotti belted in a well hit shot from almost 18 yards out and found himself with a lucky deflection of a Gaucho defender as the ball rolled into the back of the net. Now tied at one a piece, tensions on both sides began to simmer down and the half time whistle sounded as both teams returned to their locker rooms in order to formulate a better plan of attack.</p>\n<p>Both head coaches made the substitutions they deemed necessary in order to alter the attacking momentum, but it was to no avail. The second half of play pretty much was a defensive spectacle as both lines held their own on each side of the final thirds of the pitch. Only a combined two more shots on goal were recorded for the two teams. Soon enough, the final whistle came and the pressure was on as exhaustion began to creep in on both sides.</p>\n<p>The overtime ruling was simple; both sides would continue playing through the game clock until one side scored. Once again, the passing was present once more as the two teams chose to patiently chart out their plan of attack. But Michael only needed one more try at the goal in order to award his team with a much deserved victory. This time assisted, it was sophomore forward Ignacio Tellechea who picked out an open Michael. Then, with an almost clear line of sight at the goal, he curled in his shot into the far right of the net. The team celebrations then began for UCSB as the close bout turned into three points and a well-earned victory.</p>\n<p>After this performance, Tellechea now finds himself in second place on the team’s assist category. But who’s in first you ask? Well it’s the so far undisputed team MVP: Rodney Michael. Michael now has a grand total of four assists, but most impressively he’s now recorded seven goals in his seven matches played on the season. Thus, he must now be in consideration when the league MVP talks commence later on in the year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now improve to the No. 1 overall spot in the Big West conference rankings with their total of 14 points in seven matches. They’ll look to cement their position and add to their tally this weekend in a home game against the division’s second place team: UC Davis.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79238\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79238\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-20/ucsb-claims-big-west-no-1-spot-beat-sac-state-in-overtime/","id":1381,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1380,1379,1378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Best Sac State in Upcoming Conference Match","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos hope to jump back to the top of the Big West North standings beginning with a win at Sac State.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Phew, we can all now take a breather from last Saturday’s nail-biting Blue-Green rivalry game against Cal Poly, which ultimately ended in a heated double overtime tie. Nevertheless, the UCSB men’s soccer season rolls on.</p>\n<p>The race for seeding in the Big West standings continues to intensify. The Gauchos, who are 5-5-4 and 3-1-2, have a little leeway as they sit in second place within the conference’s North division, two points behind first and one point ahead of third.</p>\n<p>That being said, it’s crunch time, and Santa Barbara is now four games away from either clinching a seed in the Big West Tournament or altogether missing out on the postseason party. Week 4 starts now, and how the men’s soccer team closes this year’s campaign will speak volumes for its ability to perhaps even acquire a NCAA Tournament invite when all is said and done.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The Hornets are coming off a 2-0 loss against conference leader UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Its record may not show it, but Sac State has been able to compete at the highest level all season long, and with its amount of wins, it finds itself at third in the Big West North.</p>\n<p>Notably, the Gauchos are at a flat 1-1-1 record in conference road matches this season. Playing away from home has been an issue for UCSB, as it is 1-4-1 on the road, including the non-conference portion of its schedule.</p>\n<p>Considering both teams’ history with each other, however, the Gauchos are at a very solid advantage with their all-time record versus Sac State, sitting at a favorable 13-4-3. Regardless, UCSB must not count out any of their opponents, especially due to these close standings; everyone will be pushing for a postseason spot.</p>\n<p>Some key players for Sac State are two of their best playmakers. Both are underclassmen and forwards, beginning with Hornet freshman Justin Bedig, who has been phenomenal in the creation of plays all season long.</p>\n<p>He leads his team in the assist category with a total of six assists on the year, not to mention a pair of goals to add to his name. Meanwhile, his sophomore peer, Christian Webb, also leads a statistical category as the team’s leading scorer with six goals on the year.</p>\n<p>On the Gauchos’ side, freshman forward Rodney Michael still resides as one of the team’s most valuable players as he leads in both scoring and assists, with five goals and four assists.</p>\n<p>Adding more depth to his current hot streak of performances, Michael is also second in most shots on goal in the entire Big West stat standings.</p>\n<p>We also briefly mentioned his teammate, freshman Gaucho goalkeeper Alan Carrillo, last week when he won the Big West “Defensive Player of the Week” award. Including last week’s 0-0 tie to Cal Poly, Carrillo continues his impressive entrance to college soccer with now two clean sheets.</p>\n<p>Carrillo also impressively leads the entire Big West in goals against average with a 0.96 percentage and is currently marked as second in total save percentage with a .754. Of course, part of Carrillo’s success can be attributed to the formidable defensive line he leads in front of the goal, but nonetheless, the Gauchos have been able to get the job done and will look to close out strong come Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>The Sac State game will truly be a test of Santa Barbara’s endurance, as it will be a mid-season divisional matchup with much on the line.</p>\n<p>Both sides bolster a young productive roster and will want to get those three coveted points that will bring them that much closer to a playoff selection seed.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos visit the Sac State Hornets this Wednesday, Oct. 18. Kickoff commences at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79173\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79173\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/gauchos-look-to-best-sac-state-in-upcoming-conference-match/","id":1379,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1378,1377,1376],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Extend Winning Streak Away at UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hopes to continue its winning stretch in its midweek match at UC Davis.

While currently 1-0-1 during away games, UCSB are also undefeated on the season at a 3-0-1 record. They’ll try to keep their winning ways afloat however, as they face off against a 2-1-1 UC Davis side who currently hold the third place position on the Big West league standings.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, even with the Gauchos’ impressive start, a win for UC Davis will be enough to hoist them up to the first place spot. So UCSB will be in fully competitive spirits in order to assert their conference domination even more. Expect another low scoring affair due to the Aggies lack of offense and the Gauchos on the road productivity, but quite a heated game as each side of the pitch would like to find the back of the net early on.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Looking back on last Saturday’s game, a lot can be taken away from the defensive end. Specifically so, straight from the goalkeeper himself: UCSB freshman Alan Carillo. Carillo, who currently averages only a single goal allowed per game, has recently been awarded his 2<sup>nd</sup> honor as the Big West Defensive Player of the Week. With a clean sheet already on record, and coming off an outstanding 8 save game versus Irvine, he is truly on fire and it’s helping pave the way for UCSB’s continued success.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos attacking third of the pitch, a clear cut MVP for the early part of the season can be found in freshman forward Rodney Michael. With already the most goals for the team (5) and the most assists as well (4), Michael has seemingly found himself to be a part of the match highlights week in and week out.</p>\n<p>A recurring trend can be spotted here considering underclassmen play has been very vital for UCSB thus far. Altogether combined, Gaucho underclassmen have notched a grand total of 14 goals and 11 assists on the year. So it’s clear to see that the men’s soccer program’s future is bright and head coach Tim Vom Steeg has done his due diligence during the offseason scouting.</p>\n<p>When analyzing UC Davis’ current team performance, praise can be given to them on the final third of the pitch. However, not much offensive productivity has been observed so far. With only 5 goals over their first 4 conference games, it can be argued that the Aggies have yet to click; it’s unlikely they’ll finally get things going come Wednesday night when they face off against an ever stout UCSB backline. UC Davis are led by junior forward Matt Baringer and senior midfielder Miguel Acevedo, whom both have 3 goals on the year and 2 assists apiece.</p>\n<p>The Aggies last game definitely didn’t go their way as they fell 2-0 to UC Riverside. In perspective, UC Riverside is dead last in Big West conference standings and the Gauchos bested them a couple weeks ago at home by a score of 3-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters this week’s matchup as the slight favorite, but this game can still go either way. The Gauchos also lead in their all time record against the Aggies by a score of 22-8-5.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will visit UC Davis this Wednesday, October 11 at 4 p.m. They will also host Cal Poly for the Blue-Green rivalry this Saturday, Oct. 14 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79126\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-10/gauchos-look-to-extend-winning-streak-away-at-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79126\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-10/gauchos-look-to-extend-winning-streak-away-at-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-10/gauchos-look-to-extend-winning-streak-away-at-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-10/gauchos-look-to-extend-winning-streak-away-at-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-10/gauchos-look-to-extend-winning-streak-away-at-uc-davis/","id":1496,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1495,1494,1493],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Rides 4-Game Win Streak Into Cal State Northridge Thurs.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsUCR-170930-DustinHarris-06-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hopes to sustain its momentum against a Cal State Northridge team that is in need of a victory.

After losing its conference opener in the 2016-17 season, UCSB went on to win six of its eight next matches (6-0-2) before its next loss. In 2015-16, the Gauchos won their first four Big West matchups.</p>\n<p>Over its two conference matchups, UCSB has already netted a total of eight goals on the season.</p>\n<p>Compared to the eight goals they scored throughout their entire 10-match non-conference schedule, the progress of this young roster is very much visible.</p>\n<p>With a current total of seven different goal scorers, the team is now led by two different players in this statistic category. Sophomore forward Ignacio Tellechea originally came onto the scene as the team’s leading goal scorer during the non-conference portion of the year. He also notched in another goal during the conference home opener against Fullerton via a beautifully curled shot from around the corner spot.</p>\n<p>Next up is freshman forward Rodney Michael, who has now scored a goal in each Big West match thus far. It was announced Monday that Michael was selected as the Big West Offensive Player of the Week. Both Tellechea and</p>\n<p>Michael currently sit at the top of the team’s scoring stats with four goals apiece, and will look to improve upon that tally come game night against CSUN.</p>\n<p>As for the Matadors, the beginning stages of the Big West season have not been very kind as they had to start off with two games on the road to finish five straight road matches. Still, Northridge is 2-1 on the year at home and will expect to turn things around once UCSB comes to town.</p>\n<p>A likely candidate to resolve CSUN’s goal scoring drought would be senior forward Emmanuel Usen Jr., who has totaled five goals for his side on the year. Also adding two assists to his name, Usen will surely be the beneficiary of most Matador targets and key to Head Coach Terry Davila’s game plan.</p>\n<p>Speaking of head coaches, much respect can be awarded to UCSB’s Tim Vom Steeg for getting his team ready in time for the conference regular season. The Gauchos are currently the only Big West team without a conference loss. Consistency will be key from here on out, and all signs point upwards for the Gauchos’ yearlong campaign and postseason aspirations.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be on the road this Thursday night, Oct. 5, to face Cal State Northridge at 7 p.m. at the Matador Soccer Field.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 5, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78996\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78996\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-rides-4-game-win-streak-into-cal-state-northridge-thurs/","id":1398,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1397,1396,1395],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Strong Second-Half Leads Gauchos Past Titans in Big West Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite falling behind early, the Gauchos scored four unanswered goals to shock CSUF 5-2 in their conference opener.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Harder Stadium was booming Thursday night as the UCSB men’s soccer team hosted Cal State Fullerton for its conference season opener.

A 1-0 record is how every team wishes to start their new year, but the Gauchos will surely try to remain undefeated as they immediately game plan for a newly 0-1 UC Riverside team.</p>\n<p>Early on into Thursday’s match, both sides look fairly even as offenses went back and forth at each other’s keepers.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the 15<sup>th</sup> minute of play when UCSB conceded the first of the match to Fullerton’s top goal scorer, midfielder Ross McPhie. The goal came off a 1 on 1 from the sideline where the Fullerton winger crossed the ball on the floor. The pass skidded perfectly to McPhie and rebounded off his deflection and into the goal.</p>\n<p>For the next half hour or so all seemed to be going in Fullerton’s favor. Then, in the 40<sup>th</sup> minute, UCSB forward Derek Kryzda was subbed in and made an immediate impact by netting in the equalizer for the ‘Chos. After another sideline attack and impressive nutmeg, Kryzda was on the receiving end of a beautifully set pass and connected from the left of the goalkeeper’s box.</p>\n<p>It was halftime now and most fans were still breathless from the immense cheering before the half. Following the 2<sup>nd</sup> kickoff, momentum still seemed to favor Fullerton. Then, off a cross from about 30 yards out, the ball somehow managed to find itself in the back of Santa Barbara’s net due to the players and keeper’s distraction from a positional battle.</p>\n<p>Hopes plummeted once more, but for hardly any time as UCSB found a response about a half minute later. The Gaucho offense surged forward as Fullerton’s back field seemed lackadaisical following their team’s score. After a quick play from the wing the Gauchos also found a lucky ricochet for themselves and evened the score once again.</p>\n<p>From here on out the match was very one sided as UCSB began to net in what appeared to be every chance they got. Each shot on goal was also finished magisterially as forward Ignacio Tellechea curled one in from the corner area, defender Adrian Adames chipped in a save from around the 18 yard line, and midfielder Michael Rodney nestled in the final goal of the night on the keeper’s strong side.</p>\n<p>With a final score of 5-2, the Gauchos truly showed their colors and found an offensive formation that can work in the future. Now they’ll try to extend their record to 2-0 and hopefully establish a home streak that opponents can fear.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face off against UC Riverside this Saturday, September 30<sup>th</sup>, in Harder Stadium at approximately 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-29/strong-second-half-leads-gauchos-past-titans-in-big-west-opener/","id":1396,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1395,1394,1393],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Chos Look to Rock Harder Thursday Hosting CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-09-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's soccer team hopes of repeating as regular season North Big West champs kicking off its conference season against Cal State Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It’s here again, the Big West slate of the season.

A keynote to still keep in mind, however, would be their goal count, as the Titans put up a very productive 10 goals in nine games.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78849\" style=\"width: 513px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-15_stephenmanga_msoccer-3-web/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78849\" data-attachment-id=\"78849\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/2017-09-15_stephenmanga_msoccer-3-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-78849\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=503%2C336\" alt=\"\" width=\"503\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.15_StephenManga_MSoccer-3-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78849\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rodney Michael steals the ball from the opposing team. <em>Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, UCSB has had its fair share of struggles. The Gauchos are currently below .500 following some inconsistent non-conference performances, which in most part were due to their lack of goal production, as they only scored five goals in eight matches.</p>\n<p>The greatest positive for UCSB has been its recent undefeated stretch. That being said, those wins all took place at home and are a part of a current five-game homestay that will conclude this weekend. One thing’s for certain: Both teams will undoubtedly wish to keep their winning ways by upsetting the other’s momentum early.</p>\n<p>A clear key player to be observed on the Titans’ end is junior midfielder, Ross McPhie. With a respectable four goals and one assist on the year, McPhie’s production, or lack thereof, may very well be the deciding factor for the Gauchos come Thursday night.</p>\n<p>As his club’s leading goal scorer, he has also been on a roll lately with three goals in his last four starts. Not to mention, he also netted the match’s only goal last week for the Titans’ 1-0 victory over UNLV. The Gaucho coaching staff will surely keep McPhie in their sights while creating the game plan.</p>\n<p>The potential for Gaucho glory Thursday, however, may very well still be in reach from a defensive viewpoint. Over the last two matches, UCSB has only allowed one score, which occurred from its exhibition match versus Club America’s U-20 team. Similarly, Fullerton has only allowed two scores in its past four games, as they’ll try to stop UCSB’s own leading goal scorer, sophomore forward Ignacio Tellechea.</p>\n<p>Historically speaking, the Gauchos vs. Titans conference matchup has favored the former, as Thursday’s home side UCSB leads with a 31-26-3 series record. Currently, however, Santa Barbara is ranked last in the Big West Northern standings due to their low win percentage of .375.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cal State Fullerton boasts a .611 and sits atop the Big West South with the best overall record. While significant, what matters most will officially begin Thursday with conference play.</p>\n<p>Kickoff between UCSB and Cal State Fullerton starts Thursday, Sept. 28, at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Sept. 28, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78859\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78859\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/chos-look-to-rock-harder-thursday-hosting-csuf/","id":1395,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1394,1393,1392],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Morgan, Freund Set to Face No. 3 Florida in First Round of the NCAA Doubles Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite the team being knocked out a couple weeks ago, Morgan Mays and Simon Freund will team up one last time in hopes of making some noise in the NCAA doubles championships.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB men’s tennis returns once more as the final postseason bout is soon to be underway.

He played various sports growing up, but naturally he excelled most at tennis, enough so that his play began to be recognized on the International Tennis Federation junior rankings. He notes that his three consecutive ITF junior event victories were his most memorable sports moments and perhaps the turning point in his decision to take his craft to the next level.</p>\n<p>“I always wanted to play at the college level,” Mays said when asked about his transition into college. “To play for a team and be a part of a group environment was my goal.” Fast forward a few years and Mays would go on to achieve that goal.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>During his freshman year, Mays was recruited by Wake Forest University, whose team is currently ranked first in the nation according to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association standings. His time there, however, was short-lived, as he ultimately decided to transfer to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“[Wake Forest] is a great school with a great tennis program, but I was looking for different opportunities like playing higher in the lineup — opportunities I would go on and receive here.”</p>\n<p>A chance to prove himself, and the ability to return back to the West Coast were all Mays could’ve asked for as he arrived at UCSB during the 2014-15 season.</p>\n<p>“When I came here I saw lots and lots of potential,” Mays said about his initial thoughts, “[and] a tight knit conference alongside an incredible coaching staff.”</p>\n<p>Mays went on to reference Head Coach Marty Davis’s own collegiate career and his status as a top-40 overall player and top 10 in doubles play. Paired with Assistant Coach Blake Muller and his illustrious career at Stanford, the team was led by some of the greatest former talents.</p>\n<p>“I was really excited when I got here … I saw everyone really intent on changing the culture here.” Mays mentioned because previous to the 2013 season, Santa Barbara was not yet the Big West powerhouse we see today. The team was also nonfactors at a national scale, with all of their recent NCAA Tournament appearances being cut short in the Round of 64 mark. Their last most successful showing came back in 1997 when UCSB was ranked No. 17 in the nation and reached the Sweet 16 stage of the competition. Since then, and from the turn of the century, the Gauchos haven’t really played at that same sense of quality.</p>\n<p>During his junior year, Mays first began to see himself consistently lead the pack at the roster’s court one spot. He also became captain for the first time as an upperclassman.</p>\n<p>“It was another opportunity I looked very much forward to; [captaining] is a position of high responsibility and it meant that much more considering we were coming off a great year since we had won the Big West title,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mays followed this up by making the point that, early on, every season the team wanted to see exactly where they’d stack up in the conference; however, their expectations began to involve a pursuit of placement onto the ITA rankings. That same year, Mays posted a 17-11 singles record and a 13-9 in dual play, which earned him an All-Conference First Team Singles selection and an Honorable Mention in Doubles. The team went on to qualify as their conference’s first seed and claimed back to back Big West championships. “</p>\n<p>Starting last year, with the bringing in of newer and younger faces, was when I saw the tennis program’s culture first begin to change,” Mays said.</p>\n<p>Mays was referring to standout names like sophomores Anders Holm and Nicolas Moreno, as well as his doubles co-star junior Simon Freund. The identity of UCSB’s tennis program truly started to emerge as they began to set their goals high with a conference three-peat and potential upsets versus opposing top-tier programs.</p>\n<p>As this season’s campaign began to wind down, the accolades and record breaking began to pour in. UCSB’s late calendar win streak of 12 in a row handed them another Big West first seed which ultimately resulted in both a league and playoff clean sweep, granting the program their championship trifecta. Their overall season record of 19-6 had them at a .760 win percentage, which is the highest in franchise history and earned them the No. 37 ITA ranking. This national ranking finish also ended up being the program’s third-ever highest spot, with only the 1997 and 1998 teams both finishing top 25 in the nation.</p>\n<p>“This was the first time in a while that people started to notice us on a national stage … we faced four different top-10 teams in the early part of the season and managed a great performance against all of them,” he said.</p>\n<p>All in all, Morgan Mays was once again elected to the All-Conference First Team and even announced as the Big West Player of the Year. Davis also earned 2017’s Coach of the Year recognition. Regionally speaking, ITA also honored Mays with the Arthur Ashe Leadership and Sportsmanship Award and Muller as Assistant Coach of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Altogether it’s been an incredible year, I’m proud and I really believe the culture has shifted upwards from here. I truly think this program will excel and continue to win titles for years to come … all thanks to Marty and Blake, we all hope this mentality will keep growing.”</p>\n<p>Much praise can be passed on to the UCSB men’s tennis team, but there’s still more work left to be done. As for now, fans and Gauchos alike can surely be excited for more years of tennis court dominance thanks to a stellar youth core and a phenomenal coaching staff.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77938\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77938\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/changing-the-culture-how-mays-helped-shape-an-elite-tennis-program/","id":1206,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1205,1204,1203],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos-Rebels Showdown Set for First Round of NCAA Championships","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Able to three-peat as Big West champions, the Gauchos are looking to make the next step to go deeper in the postseason beginning this Friday against Ole Miss.

Out of the 63 other teams in attendance, Santa Barbara drew Ole Miss.</p>\n<p>This is the third year in a row the Gauchos were able to earn an NCAA slot and make it this far into the postseason. However, each year they haven’t been able to make it out of the first round.</p>\n<p>Last year had a then No. 44 UCSB face off against a No. 32 Georgia Tech, which ultimately had the Yellow Jackets claiming the meet at a score of 4-1. The year before that was also a 4-2 loss to Texas Tech University.</p>\n<p>However, there’s plenty to update before the national competition commences. The Gauchos are coming off an exciting Big West Championship run which was sweetly capped off with a 4-1 victory over their Blue-Green rival, the Cal Poly Mustangs.</p>\n<p>This competition had impressive performances across all team members, which ultimately elevated UCSB’s standings in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings. Previously at the No. 40 spot, the Gauchos now boast No. 37 overall.</p>\n<p>As for Santa Barbara’s star Court 1 doubles pair of junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays, they also remain in the top 40 in the nation at No. 35 overall.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ole Miss’s regular-season finish led to it earning sixth place in the SEC tennis standings.</p>\n<p>The Rebels are coming off their most recent match against the University of Florida, in which they were swept 4-0 in the quarterfinal round and subsequently knocked out of the SEC championship tournament.</p>\n<p>This result hardly deteriorated their ITA score, as their ranking actually moved up a spot, from No. 28 to No. 27. The Rebels also hold both singles and doubles honors, as junior All-American Gustav Hansson is ranked 23rd in the nation while sophomore Fabian Fallert and junior Grey Hamilton hold the 19th overall spot.</p>\n<p>Before being swept 4-0, Ole Miss was on an eight-match win streak with its last loss occurring back in early April.</p>\n<p>Adding incentive to the match will be the No. 4 singles match, as both Ole Miss’s sophomore Fabian Fallert and UCSB’s sophomore Anders Holm will look to end each other’s 11-match win streaks.</p>\n<p>Friday will be the first time UCSB has ever faced Ole Miss. The recurring strategy and point of emphasis has been the Gauchos’ doubles play. It has been key in their double-digit win streak and has aided the team’s ability to stand its ground against top-20 programs.</p>\n<p>“The doubles point is always so huge,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “It’s only one point but it’s the first point of the match, and emotionally it gave us a real lift … singles as a result has shown this.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went undefeated in the entire month of April and will look to start May off on the right foot as well. The winner of this first-round matchup will then go on and face either No. 5 UCLA or Army West Point.</p>\n<p>UCSB is set to play Ole Miss on Friday, May 12, at 10 a.m. at UCLA’s Sunset Canyon Tennis Courts.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77780\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77780\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/gauchos-rebels-showdown-set-for-first-round-of-ncaa-championships/","id":1203,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1202,1201,1200],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Heir to the Throne: Why Giannis Will One Day Usurp LeBron","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-13-at-11.48.15-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-shot-2017-05-13-at-11.48.15-AM.png?resize=628%2C542&ssl=1","description":"With time comes new superstars.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Born on Dec. 6, 1994, Antetokounmpo was only 18 years old when he was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks, making him the youngest in the 2013 NBA Draft.</p>\n<p>However, his rise to stardom started inside of Greece’s second division basketball league. Here he managed a 9.5 points and 5.0 rebounds per game average over 26 total games for Filathlitikos, which sparked conversation as his potential began to be noticed. Spanish clubs like Barcelona and Zaragoza then began to show their interest in him and touted his prodigious ability.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Antetokounmpo remained in Greece until the conclusion of the 2012-13 season. His next move was then perhaps the wisest decision of his life: become eligible for the NBA Draft. Then the rest was history.</p>\n<p>Well, not exactly history. Presently, Antetokounmpo is respected and perhaps even feared by his peers, but let’s look at the early moments of his professional career.</p>\n<p>Following his first round, No. 15 overall selection by the Bucks, Antetokounmpo gradually made an impact on the court. In his first three NBA seasons he averaged 12.1 points, 3.0 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game. Not particularly standout numbers, however, he earned enough accolades along the way to promote his projection toward greatness.</p>\n<p>In his rookie year, he totaled 61 blocks which led all rookies in the NBA, thus earning himself a spot on the All-Rookie Second Team roster. His physical prowess was first recognized during his sophomore season when he was invited to participate in the NBA Slam Dunk contest. Later that year, Antetokounmpo also helped his team achieve its first playoff win since its 2009-10 campaign. In just his third season, he etched himself into Milwaukee Bucks history with the most triple-doubles in a single season.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t look like he’s sweating or even breathing hard,” Bucks Head Coach Jason Kidd said when interviewed about Giannis’ play, “and that shows just how talented he really is.”</p>\n<p>Over the years, Giannis has received similar praise from his idols like Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson; however, none as directly valuable as from the King himself: LeBron James.</p>\n<p>“A guy that can handle the ball at that size is special … at that speed, with his length. I think J-Kidd does a great job of placing him in the lineup where he sees a mismatch, and so he’s all over the floor.”</p>\n<p>This quote not only puts Antetokounmpo’s young and outstanding career into perspective, but also brings us to his comparisons with LeBron, currently the best player in the game.</p>\n<p>Yes, best player in the game. Sure he may not be in MVP contention amongst the names of Russell Westbrook and James Harden; but no one else can match LeBron’s level of speed and power. Well, perhaps Antetokounmpo will one day.</p>\n<p>In terms of this regular season’s production, the pair each had noteworthy seasons. LeBron averaged 26.4 points, 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game whereas Antetokounmpo maintained an average of 22.9 points, 5.4 assists and 8.7 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>The two also started side by side in the 2017 NBA All-Star Game as members of the first team roster. When the Cavaliers visited the Bucks back in November, Antetokounmpo led his team to a 118-101 victory after scoring a total of 34 points, 12 rebounds, five steals, five assists and two blocks all whilst being matched up with LeBron. The two later acknowledged each others efforts with a respectful post-game hug, but from watching that game one can tell how special Antetokounmpo will be.</p>\n<p>As for the remainder of Giannis’s season this year, he scored a career high of 41 points in a February game against the Lakers, became the youngest All-Star in franchise history and, most especially, led his team in all five of the major record categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks.</p>\n<p>Altogether Antetokounmpo’s athletic skills and raw talent can only pose a resemblance to LeBron’s. Each player has a unique capacity to strike panic into opponents when they’re headed toward the rim with both size and speed.</p>\n<p>However, it can be understood that in both statistic and legacy, Antetokounmpo has a while to go before catching up to LeBron. Although, he still has plenty of time to do so as he’s only 22 years old.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 11, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77766\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77766\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/heir-to-the-throne-why-giannis-will-one-day-usurp-lebron/","id":1888,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1887,1886,1885],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Tennis Completes Three-Peat, Fourth Big West Title in Five Years","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017.04.22_StephenManga_MTennis-17.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB took home the Big West conference title following a win in the championship game against rival Cal Poly by a 4-1 result.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team continues their win streak into the postseason.

Santa Barbara arrived at Indian Wells Tennis Garden last Thursday for their semifinal match against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The doubles portion was more closely fought than the Gauchos would have like. Nevertheless, UCSB won on every doubles court; thanks to Morgan Mays / Simon Freund on court 1 (7-5), Nicolas Moreno / Anders Holm on court 2 (6-4), and Cody Rakela / Kristian Prior on court 3 (6-6).</p>\n<p>The singles portion of Thursday’s meet was where the Gauchos finally found their form, as they lead 1-0 with the doubles advantage point. First to finish was Holm on court 4, whom bested UCI’s Mason Hansen after a pair of 6-2 victories.</p>\n<p>Next was Rakela vs. Bruce Man-Son-Hing on court 5, which ended in Santa Barbara’s favor at 6-1 / 6-2. Then, the deciding match took place on court 3 where Freund almost swept Luis Lopez by a score of 6-0 / 6-1. Ultimately, this gave UCSB the three remaining points necessary to take home the early 4-0 win on the day; thus granting them a Big West Championship spot on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly defeated second seed UC Davis that same Thursday after a hard fought 4-2 win, therefore earning themselves a visit with UCSB for the second year in a row.</p>\n<p>Sunday’s finals meet almost mirrored the same intensity as these teams’ regular season bout. The day began with the doubles portion, per usual, as court 3 first went in favor of Mustangs Auproux and Damiens by a score of 6-4. UCSB then responded on court 2 with a 6-2 victory by Moreno and Holm.</p>\n<p>Finally, the deciding doubles match was an exciting nail biter on court 1 where Freund / Mays met against Pang / Donovan for perhaps their most important sets of the season. It was a tough competition to watch, but UCSB eventually prevailed by a close victory of 7-6 (3).</p>\n<p>Currently with the doubles advantage point and early 1-0 lead, the Gauchos were just 3 wins away from earning the title through singles play. Cal Poly’s Corey Pang made a quick statement on court 1 with a pair of 6-4 victories, bringing his team back into the meet at a 1-all score.</p>\n<p>Then Holm matched this result with a pair of 6-4’s for himself on court 4. Once again, Freund extended the Gauchos’ lead after a tough 7-6 (6) score, then a 6-0 sweep, on court 3.</p>\n<p>Now, with the meet at 3-1 and in favor of Santa Barbara, the next court to finish would be able to decide the tournament. On court 2, Nicolas Moreno faced off against Ben Donovan as the two battled it out for a three setter.</p>\n<p>Moreno took the first with a smooth 6-0 sweep, but then Donovan clawed back into it with a 6-4 of his own. Then, Moreno earned not only another victory for his team, but the last point necessary to crown UCSB as champions in the Big West conference.</p>\n<p>Upon the meet’s conclusion, the ceremony commenced as the Gauchos celebrated a three-peat championship performance. Including the second year in a row in which Santa Barbara topples their rival Cal Poly, in the finals, by a score of 4-1.</p>\n<p>Following last weekend’s results, UCSB’s ITA rankings continue to grow as they are currently hoping for a participant spot in this year’s NCAA Men’s Tennis Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will take a short break as they await a tournament at-large bid from the selection committee. Tune in this Tuesday at 2 PM as the Selection Show will inform UCSB of their NCAA Regional game opponent.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

It also earned its fourth regular season title with Head Coach Marty Davis at the helm.</p>\n<p>Dating back to April 11, 2015, UCSB has extended its win streak against Big West opponents to 11 straight victories in the regular season.  Including the past two conference tournaments, Santa Barbara holds a 16-match win streak against its Big West counterparts.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has been in outstanding form as of late; its last meet loss was way back on March 13 against No. 4 Texas Christian University.</p>\n<p>After their victory over the current No. 50 Cal Poly, the Gauchos are currently No. 40 in the nation according to Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings.</p>\n<p>The duo sensation of Gaucho junior Simon Freund and senior Morgan Mays maintains a No. 30 doubles ranking as well, moving down one spot from No. 29.</p>\n<p>“This match [against Cal Poly] was actually bigger than the western conference regular season title,” Davis said. “We think it’s going to leave us far enough in the rankings where our RPI should get us into that large [NCAA selection] bid, regardless of the result at Indian Wells.”</p>\n<p>Coach Davis is referring to a spot for the Gauchos in the NCAA 2017 Division I men’s tennis tournament. That, of course, won’t occur until after the Big West Tournament and is set for some time around the middle of May.</p>\n<p>There’s much to know as UCSB enters the Big West Tournament in fine form, as well as with many historical accolades.</p>\n<p>The men’s tennis team will be competing for its third consecutive conference title. The Gauchos have previously won the Big West Tournament championships a total of 10 times program history.</p>\n<p>They have won 7 of the last 11 tournaments at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, which will once again be this year’s competition venue.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Big West championship concluded with a No. 1 and No. 2 seed finals matchup that had Santa Barbara face off against rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The meet resulted in a 4-1 score and featured the familiar competitors of sophomore doubles pair Nicolas Moreno de Alboran/Anders Holm, junior Cody Rakela, senior Morgan Mays and senior Teague Hamilton, as well as Cal Poly’s No. 61 duo of seniors Corey Pang and Ben Donovan.</p>\n<p>Previewing Friday’s potential competitors, UCSB will meet against the winner of Wednesday’s No. 4- versus No. 5-seeded match of UC Irvine and the University of Hawaii.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s dominance of both programs has been well established over the years.</p>\n<p>It last lost to UC Irvine during the 2014-15 season and fell to Hawaii during its 2012-13 campaign. Due to rain, the matchup between UCSB and Hawaii was canceled during the 2013-14 season.</p>\n<p>Irvine ended its season with a 5-2 loss to No. 2-seed UC Davis and concluded its 2017 regular season at 8-14. The Anteaters also managed a fourth-place conference ranking following a 2-4 finish.</p>\n<p>UCSB previously defeated UC Irvine 5-2 on April 15 while on the road.</p>\n<p>As for Hawaii, the Gauchos opened up their season with an away doubleheader against the Rainbow Warriors, which resulted in a 7-0 sweep. They ended the season last in the Big West Conference standings at 1-4 and also finished their regular season with a meager 2-14 overall record.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face off against the winner of the No. 4/5 seed match, either UC Irvine or the University of Hawaii, this Friday, April 28 at 3 p.m. at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 27, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77350\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77350\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/mens-tennis-in-search-of-three-peat-heading-into-the-big-west-tournament/","id":1200,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1199,1198,1197],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Meta Mock Draft: 2017 First-Round NFL Draft Broken Down","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nfldraft2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nfldraft2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff Writer Richard Benites randomly selected the mock drafts of 25 of today’s top sports world analysts and isolated their popular majority per player and per draft pick.

With a remarkable total of 31 sacks and 47 tackles for loss in his three-year career as an Aggie, scouts are raving about this future rookie with all-pro potential. Just to add more fuel to the fire, Garrett, at 6’5” and 271 lbs, ran a 4.62 time in the 40-yard dash at his pro day. At this point, it’d be foolish for the Browns to pass up on such a franchise talent.       </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 2 San Francisco 49ers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Solomon Thomas, DE, Stanford </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With player comparisons to Brandon Graham, or even “a smaller J.J. Watt,” Solomon Thomas caught many scouts’ eyes during his two-year stint at Stanford. Following an impressive combine performance, we saw Thomas’s draft stock rise and rise. Now with, new 49ers general manager John Lynch at the helm, he’ll make sure to play it safe with his inaugural first-round pick and pick the next-best player after Garrett.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 3 Chicago Bears:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jonathan Allen, DE, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winner of the 2016 Bronco Nagurski Trophy for best college defensive player in the nation, Jonathan Allen had quite the outstanding campaign during his four years at Alabama. With 152 total tackles and 28 sacks, Allen has the stats and durability to prove that he’s NFL-ready. The Bears could look to bolster either their defensive line or secondary here. One thing is for sure, Chicago’s defense could really use a first-round game changer.    </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 4 Jacksonville Jaguars:</b></p>\n<p><b>Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before starting with Leonard Fournette, we urge you to please look up some of his highlights. At 6’1” and 228 lbs, he possesses the ability to escape the line of scrimmage and the strength to break the tackle. Fournette’s play style has been appropriately compared to that of Ezekiel Elliott’s, and he is arguably the best offensive player in the entire draft. This LSU halfback has what it takes to be a week-one starter in Jacksonville and may very well be the spark needed to get the Jaguars’ offense going.         </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 5 Tennessee Titans:</b></p>\n<p><b>Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the 2016 college football season, Ohio State’s Marshon Lattimore allowed an average NFL passer rating of 30.2 whenever he covered the throw. Do you know what the NFL passer rating is for spiking the ball into the ground on every play? It’s 39.6. Yeah, you don’t need to be a statistician to realize that’s ridiculous. This year, Lattimore is heralded as the best cornerback coming out of college, so the Titans would be wise to choose him over a wide receiver because he definitely won’t be present for their 18th overall pick.   </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 6 New York Jets:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jamal Adams, S, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been multiple reports recently that a Jamal Adams as a first overall talent. However, analysts agree that the Browns probably won’t trade out of the first pick and will most likely let Adams fall to another team. Regardless, with 209 total tackles and five interceptions throughout his college career, the Jets find their missing link with this pick.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 7 Los Angeles Chargers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers have built a sneaky good secondary over the past few seasons. So after a stellar combine performance by Malik Hooker, it very well seems he is San Diego-bound. With seven interceptions in only two seasons at Ohio State, Hooker has arguably the best hands in the draft.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 8 Carolina Panthers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Fournette off the board, the Panthers have a choice to make at running back. The very versatile Christian McCaffrey is an interesting option as well, but Carolina will ultimately settle for a halfback that can get it done on every down. At 4,464 yards and 46 touchdowns over three seasons for Florida State, Dalvin Cook will relieve some pressure off his quarterback and former league MVP, Cam Newton.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 9 Cincinnati Bengals:</b></p>\n<p><b>Corey Davis, WR, Western Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bengals really hit the jackpot with both A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert highlighting their receiving corps. Unfortunately, they both face injury issues from time to time, and this is most likely due to excessive targets are thrown their way. Corey Davis has the speed and build to be a quality NFL wide receiver, so the Bengals use their No. 9 spot to form an elite trio that defenses around the league must respect.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 10 Buffalo Bills:</b></p>\n<p><b>Mike Williams, WR, Clemson </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sammy Watkins can’t get it done all by himself, so the Bills get quarterback Tyrod Taylor another target in Mike Williams. With 2,727 yards and 21 touchdowns over his four-year career at Clemson, Williams is the best receiver in this draft for many analysts. Considering his 98 receptions in just his senior year alone, it’s proven he can handle the workload of a No. 1 receiver as well. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 11 New Orleans Saints:</b></p>\n<p><b>Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In only three seasons at Tennessee, Derek Barnett racked up 32 sacks and 52 tackles for loss. These are numbers that rival Myles Garrett and other top defensive lineman in this draft, so why is he projected lower than the rest? Well, after an average performance at the NFL combine, Barnett’s draft stock began to slowly fall. Nevertheless, the stats are there and the Saints will capitalize on other teams’ dismissal of Barnett’s talent. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 12 Cleveland Browns:</b></p>\n<p><b>O.J. Howard, TE, Alabama</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Browns will close out their first-round picks with yet another player that is starter ready. O.J. Howard, the four-year tight end out of Alabama, will provide Cleveland with a 6’6” and 242 lbs target that can get it done down the middle or in the red zone. This spot may even see a quarterback selection, but with Terrelle Pryor Sr. out of the mix, another good set of hands may be the more rational option. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 13 Arizona Cardinals:</b></p>\n<p><b>Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a while now, the Cardinals have been looking for a lockdown corner that can play opposite of Patrick Peterson. Well, luckily for them, reports agree that this year’s draft talent is very deep at the cornerback position. Marlon Humphrey was the star corner at Alabama, so with five interceptions and 81 total tackles in just his two-year college career, this pick makes sense for Arizona.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 14 Philadelphia Eagles:</b></p>\n<p><b>Tre’Davious White, CB, LSU </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Eagles were busy during this offseason free agency with the signings of Alshon Jeffery to the receiving corps and Chris Long to the defensive line. So their remaining draft priorities are for a corner or running back. This can very much be where McCaffrey is selected, but the Eagles ultimately fill the most pressing need and take the 167 total tackles and six interceptions: Tre’Davious White.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 15 Indianapolis Colts:</b></p>\n<p><b>Reuben Foster, LB, Alabama </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s another draft prospect with some astonishing game film. We recommend you look up some Reuben Foster highlights because he could very well be one of the hardest hitting linebackers coming out of college since the turn of the century. With 211 total tackles and seven sacks over three seasons at Alabama, Foster would be a steal for the Colts, if he even falls this far. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 16 Baltimore Ravens:</b></p>\n<p><b>Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ravens will be building through the draft in order to re-establish a frightening defense that has twice earned them a Super Bowl title. With a couple of free agency losses to the defensive line, the Ravens select a quality defensive end in Taco Charlton. Charlton put up 28 tackles for loss and 19 sacks in his four years for Michigan. He also has the best first name in this entire draft.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 17 Washington Redskins:</b></p>\n<p><b>Jabrill Peppers, LB, Michigan </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve seen mock drafts that have Jabrill Peppers going as early as the top 10 and as late as the second round. So No. 17 overall seems like a fair spot to place the former Heisman nominee. Peppers is an all-around athletic machine, with great stats in both offensive and defensive positions. The Redskins need a playmaker that’ll make his presence known throughout the game, so they pick up this prolific Michigan linebacker.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 18 Tennessee Titans:</b></p>\n<p><b>John Ross, WR, Washington </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Ross caught many scouts’ eyes at the combine when he set the 40-yard dash record with a 4.22 time, but it’ll also be his route running skills that’ll make him go in the first round of the NFL draft. In his junior year alone, Ross caught 81 receptions for 1,150 yards and 17 touchdowns. With Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota throwing to him, this wide receiver out of Washington will likely be burning defensive backs all season long.     </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 19 Tampa Bay Buccaneers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Christian McCaffrey, RB, Stanford</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Buccaneers are currently rethinking their future with Doug Martin as their lead back. So they’ll look to the draft in order to find a replacement for the pro bowler. Enter Christian McCaffrey, the record-breaking running back out of Stanford. In only three years, McCaffrey rushed for 3,922 yards on 632 attempts. He also caught plenty out of the backfield with 99 receptions for 1,206 yards, bringing his total count to 31 touchdowns. With pick 19, Tampa Bay finds a potential franchise halfback.  </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 20 Denver Broncos:</b></p>\n<p><b>Garett Bolles, OT, Utah</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a bit of a quarterback conundrum going on in Denver at the moment. Whether it’s Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch lining up under center, they’ll need to beef up their offensive line in this year’s draft. With the Bronco’s first round pick, they select, the 6’5” and 300-pound offensive tackle, Garett Bolles out of Utah. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 21 Detroit Lions:</b></p>\n<p><b>Charles Harris, DE, Missouri </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this pick, the Lions pretty much just go for the best available player still on the board. With 34.5 tackles for loss and 18 sacks in his three seasons at Missouri, Charles Harris’s size and athleticism will easily translate into continued success within the NFL. He’ll also greatly complement Ezekiel Ansah and Haloti Ngata on the Detroit defensive line.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 22 Miami Dolphins:</b></p>\n<p><b>Forrest Lamp, OG, Western Kentucky</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One could argue that quarterback Ryan Tannehill isn’t at the franchise level, but with quality starting quarterbacks currently a scarcity in the league, the Dolphins decide to add more depth to the pass protection position. Forrest Lamp, after a great combine showing and consistent college numbers, is arguably the best offensive prospect in this year’s draft.   </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 23 New York Giants:</b></p>\n<p><b>Ryan Ramczyk, OT, Wisconsin </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quarterback has also been projected for this pick, but the Giants ultimately decide to choose a tackle that can protect their star quarterback Eli Manning. At 6’6” and 314 lbs, Ryan Ramczyk will not only protect from the pass rush but also help with the outside running game in New York.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 24 Oakland Raiders:</b></p>\n<p><b>Malik McDowell, DL, Michigan State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McDowell’s draft stock rose after his combine day impressed various scouts. Now the Raiders are projected to select this three-year Michigan State Spartan that recorded 24.5 tackles for loss with 88 total tackles.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 25 Houston Texans:</b></p>\n<p><b>Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, we have the first quarterback in the entire draft go at No. 25. Deshaun Watson, out of Clemson, is arguably the most prepared when it comes to being in control and winning games for his team. In 38 games for Clemson, he put up over 10,000 passing yards for a total of 90 touchdowns. The Texans Band-Aid their Brock Osweiler mistake and get potentially a franchise quarterback in Watson with their first-round pick.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 26 Seattle Seahawks:</b></p>\n<p><b>Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been plenty of rumors recently that the Seahawks will lose star cornerback Richard Sherman via trade, causing Seattle to draft defensive back Kevin King in the first. However, we believe Sherman will be in a Seahawks uniform next year and that Cam Robinson will be plugged right into Seattle’s o-line.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 27 Kansas City Chiefs:</b></p>\n<p><b>Zach Cunningham, LB, Vanderbilt</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kansas City’s defense has been a force to be reckoned with in past seasons, so they’ll add to the hype with this pick. Following Reuben Foster, Zach Cunningham is in the conversation for the next best at the linebacker position. This playmaker out of Vanderbilt is a tackling machine, with 256 total tackles in just three seasons of his college career. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 28 Dallas Cowboys:</b></p>\n<p><b>Takkarist McKinley, LB, UCLA </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cowboys have gotten a lot of criticism recently concerning their defensive play, and after losing a few starters to free agency, there’ll be some spots to fill. Cornerbacks, like Sidney Jones or Teez Tabor, who slipped out of the early first round are projected here. However, the Cowboys go ahead and choose UCLA linebacker Takkarist McKinley for his big frame and great athleticism. </span><br>\n<b>No. 29 Green Bay Packers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Gareon Conley, CB, Ohio State </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a roulette of starters and a couple of injuries at cornerback, Green Bay decides to go with a Buckeye and select Gareon Conley as their first-rounder. Conley had 91 tackles and six interceptions in his three seasons at Ohio State. Alongside Lattimore and Hooker, Conley helped form perhaps the best defensive back trio in college football last season. </span></p>\n<p><b>No. 30 Pittsburgh Steelers:</b></p>\n<p><b>Obi Melifonwu, S, Connecticut </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obi Melifonwu had arguably the best combine day out of anyone else in the draft. At 6’3” and 217 lbs, his draft stock skyrocketed after he put on a show in front of the scouts. In four seasons with Connecticut, Melifonwu made 349 total tackles and caught eight interceptions as a college safety.</span></p>\n<p><b>No. 31 Atlanta Falcons:  </b></p>\n<p><b> T.J. Watt, LB, Wisconsin</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a disastrous Super Bowl, Atlanta is now aware of a few spots that need replacing throughout the defensive line. So they look to linebacker T.J. Watt out of Wisconsin to remedy this. In just a pair of seasons, Watt had 17 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks. This 6’5” linebacker definitely has the size to be in this league, but can he be as big as his brother J.J. Watt? The Falcons sure hope so.</span></p>\n<p><b><strong>No.32 </strong>New England Patriots:</b></p>\n<p><strong>Adoree’ Jackson, CB, University of Southern California </strong></p>\n<p>Seeking a defensive leader in their secondary, the Saints will close out the first round finding one in cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. Over his 3 seasons at USC, Jackson put up 139 total tackles and 6 interceptions. To top it all off, he’s also a dual threat on special teams with 4 kickoff return touchdowns and another 4 coming off punt returns.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77317\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77317\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/meta-mock-draft-2017-first-round-nfl-draft-broken-down/","id":3361,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3360,3359,3358],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":6,"highestPage":8,"route":"/authors/18"}},"__N_SSG":true}
