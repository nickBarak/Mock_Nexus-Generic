UC San Diego is now 8-7 on the year, 0-1 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos started this match in fine fettle as they started the night off with a first set victory in which a late set run allowed for UCSB to pull away to the 25-20 final result.</p>\n<p>Sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders got the night’s offensive show rolling as he notched a total of 8 kills in this first set alone.</p>\n<p>The Tritons fought back in a big way as they kept the score much tighter in the second set. However, the versatility of Gaucho sophomore setter Randy DeWeese, on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball, was too much for San Diego as he led his team to their 2-0 lead on the night by a score of 30-28.</p>\n<p>The third set also resulted in a 30-28 result, except this time it was in favor of the visiting UC San Diego.</p>\n<p>Triton senior opposite/setter Tanner Syftestad helped his side to their first set victory of the night and would also go on to earn a team leading 20 total kills by the match’s end.</p>\n<p>San Diego would eventually bring the set score to two-all after a poor fourth set from Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The final score for that one ended at a sub-par 25-16 as the Gauchos never really found their momentum whilst the Tritons seemed to have everything going right their way.</p>\n<p>This fifth and final set would be the second instance in just two days considering a similar scenario occurred on Wednesday versus Pepperdine, however, that didn’t end as planned.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, stamina was of no concern and the Gauchos found their rhythm once more, even through a nail biting 20-18 win which granted them the overall win and 1-0 record in the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>“We did a lot of good things, especially early on; we just got a little complacent. San Diego is a really good team, you give them an inch and they’re going to jump on it, which they did. It could have gone either way,” said head coach Rick McLaughlin.</p>\n<p>This was a big win for UCSB not just because it was a conference match, but also because it showed it has the resiliency and stamina to hold onto a solid five-set win.</p>\n<p>“We played a good fifth game, and that’s got to be a heartbreaking loss for them [San Diego]; we’ve been on the other end of that [Wednesday against Pepperdine],” McLaughlin said. “I think this was because we started to not serve great, they stepped up their game, and you got to give them credit…we’re still a little bit young in that area where you think you have it in your hand and then all of a sudden the team starts challenging you, we start to do some funny things. We got to stop doing that and hopefully it was a learning experience.”</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great showing from both teams and a night to remember for each side’s fans. Considering the Gauchos recent performances, hopefully this gritty win should ignite UCSB’s high expectations on the season once more.</p>\n<p>“Being in this conference is the best thing for men’s volleyball…it’s awesome what the league is doing for us and I’m glad we put on a great five set show tonight,” McLaughlin said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be on the road next week as they will face off against USC on Thursday, March 1<sup>st</sup>, at 7PM for a non-conference regular season matchup.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

At that point the Gauchos couldn’t break the separation in points and the set was soon lost by a score of 25-22.</p>\n<p>By the second set, the Gauchos came out of the break with much more intensity.</p>\n<p>Thanks to an improvement in performance on the defensive side of the ball, UCSB maintained a cushion of two to three points over Pepperdine for most of the second set. The Gauchos went on to take this set by a 25-21 final score, as it was 1-all on the night’s volleyball meet.</p>\n<p>The third set proved to be not only the closest but also a crucial one, as both offenses were battling it out at the net.</p>\n<p>Gaucho junior outside hitter Corey Chavers was the key player in this one as he put up an impressive 8 kill total in this set alone.</p>\n<p>However, it was not enough as Pepperdine managed to clutch it out and hold off UCSB in the final points of the set; earning them 2-1 on the night by a set score of 26-24.</p>\n<p>Now in desperation mode, the Gauchos fought back once again and managed to take the game to a fifth set following several errors on the Waves’ side.</p>\n<p>This was also due in part because of a mid set run that allowed enough momentum for UCSB to bolster a 7-point lead, that they ultimately carried through to the end final result of 25-22.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this rollercoaster of a match didn’t go as planned for the home side as the Gauchos just couldn’t find an answer for Pepperdine’s junior outside hitter David Wieczorek, who tallied 5 total kills and led his team to the 15-12 final set win.</p>\n<p>UCSB were really only able to keep it close in the beginning of this set, but couldn’t get the job done; Pepperdine had won this reverse fixture by a dramatic 3-2 win.</p>\n<p>This Friday marks the first inaugural match of the new Men’s Volleyball league sponsored under the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>They face UC San Diego and enter with high expectations of potentially challenging the NCAA’s No. 1, Long Beach State.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Considering the overall magnitude of the team and all the years that rolled by, fans of Philadelphia craved that Vince Lombardi trophy more and more ever since the first inaugural Super Bowl back in 1967.</p>\n<p>Factor in two previous runner-up appearances (third time’s the charm), including a phenomenal 2017-18 season, and then you got the Eagles’ faithful talking about this being their year. Oh, how right they were.</p>\n<p>Before I get into the Super Bowl itself and how ‘pundits’ alike were counting out the Eagles all year long, I’m going to mention a few key moments from both regular and postseason play that stood out that ultimately led up to the completion of the Philadelphia dream as well as football’s greatest underdog tale.</p>\n<p><strong>The Field Goal Heard Around the World</strong></p>\n<p>What a start to the season this was. Carson Wentz had begun to show signs of major second-year progression, the Eagles had seemingly found a No. 1 wide receiver in Alshon Jeffery and that four-headed monster of a defensive line had only just begun its rampage on opposing quarterbacks.</p>\n<p>It was a Week Three divisional matchup at home for the Eagles when the New York Giants came knocking on Philadelphia’s door.</p>\n<p>Thrust early on into desperation mode after conceding the first two matches of the new season, the Giants sought to upset the Eagles in their own backyard and spoil the festivities of what looked to be the start of a promising year.</p>\n<p>It was a back and forth game throughout, but in the final minute of the fourth quarter, the game was tied at 24-24. The Eagles had moved up the field minimally but still had time to get into field goal range before the clock expired.</p>\n<p>On a right side curl route, Wentz found Jeffery for a 27-yard gain who then stepped out of bounds with one second remaining.</p>\n<p>Enter rookie kicker Jake Elliott, who landed the field goal from a franchise record of 61-yards out, earning the Eagles their second win of the season in very memorable fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>A Primetime Performance</strong></p>\n<p>With both teams at a 4-1 overall record, many analysts had the Eagles and Panthers battling for a top-three slot in the weekly power rankings. Luckily, the two teams would go on and face off in a primetime Thursday Night Football matchup.</p>\n<p>This away game would prove to be the hardest meeting for the Eagles this far into the season. With Cam Newton on the rise once more, Philadelphia was the only thing standing in Carolina’s way.</p>\n<p>The match was a hard-fought and close affair as both sides swapped leads several times.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the game came down to stamina as the Eagles’ defensive line completely halted the opposing run game, thus forcing Newton to overthrow and exhaust himself, resulting in a pair of late interceptions that halted all hope for a comeback.</p>\n<p>The Eagles had done it again in the clutch, proving that they were definitely a team to keep an eye on.</p>\n<p><strong>Wentz in a Lifetime</strong></p>\n<p>In the following week, the Eagles would go on to host a divisional Monday Night Football game for the ages against the Redskins. More specifically, Carson Wentz would go on and shred Washington in the air for 268 yards and four touchdowns.</p>\n<p>This standout game for Wentz would prove to be the platform for his potential MVP candidacy.</p>\n<p>Putting on a show all season long, he once again achieved some unbelievable feats by escaping collapsing pockets and making almost impossible throws all across the field.</p>\n<p>Truly, this was the start of something special for the Eagles’ organization and its fans, as talks of a deep playoff run were brewing.</p>\n<p><strong>Star Foles: A New Hope</strong></p>\n<p>Rams versus Eagles, Goff versus Wentz: a great battle in the NFC as well as the NFL Game of the Week at the famous Coliseum.</p>\n<p>At this point in the season, Philadelphia was at the top of the league standings and was just one win away from clinching the NFC East Division title.</p>\n<p>It was perhaps the most thrilling matchup yet — or perhaps I’m just biased because I saw it all go down live in person — as both sides just couldn’t stop scoring.</p>\n<p>Then, tragedy: Wentz goes down with an ACL tear after diving into the end zone in order to hand his team the lead.</p>\n<p>As Philly fans held their breath, they looked to backup quarterback Nick Foles to save the day. He’d go on to do more than just that, as we all know.</p>\n<p>Thus, the start of the Foles era began in the midst of a potentially abrupt end to the season and minute hope for what he could possibly achieve in the playoffs.</p>\n<p><strong>“They’re the Best Defense in the League; You Can’t Win!”</strong></p>\n<p>Thirty-eight total points, that was just how much the Eagles dropped on what pundits proclaimed as, ‘the best defense in the NFL.’</p>\n<p>The Vikings visited Lincoln Financial Field in hopes of earning a one-way ticket to the Super Bowl, which would be held in Minnesota regardless — that is, unless Foles and the Eagles had something to say about it.</p>\n<p>Starting with a pick-six by veteran cornerback Patrick Robinson, the floodgates were opened in Philly as the scores began to rain down on the opposing defense.</p>\n<p>Running backs LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi ground pounded, tight end Zach Ertz caught on third down to move the chains and Foles flung it into the end zone from deep … The Eagles had done it.</p>\n<p>They had finally earned their chance to return to the Super Bowl, this time in hopes of exacting revenge upon a familiar enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Super Bowl LII: Eagles 41 – Patriots 33</strong></p>\n<p>The previous section’s subheader was a critic’s quote for a reason. I can’t even begin to tell you the number of Eagles nonbelievers that were present in both national coverage and local media.</p>\n<p>You would think after all the counting out going on during the season and through the playoffs that the dialogue would change from “you can’t” to “maybe you can.” Inevitably, the Eagles went on and achieved as the underdogs once more.</p>\n<p>It was Brady, the G.O.A.T., versus Foles, the hope. Early on the Eagles took and maintained the lead.</p>\n<p>Following a pair of field goals on each side, a deep throw from Foles found its way into Jeffery’s control as he made a spectacular catch that resulted into a 34-yard touchdown.</p>\n<p>With a score of 9-3 early in the 2nd quarter, the Patriots would go on to travel all the way down the field until eventually missing on a muffed field goal attempt.</p>\n<p>The Eagles would go on and take advantage of Patriots turnovers on downs and hand the ball to Blount for a 21-yard rushing touchdown and extend their lead to 15-3.</p>\n<p>New England would soon respond after with a made long field goal, interception near the end zone, and a James White rushing touchdown with no extra point after.</p>\n<p>Halftime was on the horizon, but second year head coach Doug Pederson had something special planned for the Patriots on 4th and Goal; the “Philly Special” that is.</p>\n<p>The “Philly Special” play will go down in the Super Bowl history books as one of the best trick plays ever accomplished.</p>\n<p>This formation featured Foles ushering over to the shotgun position as yelled at his offensive line in order to distract New England’s defense.</p>\n<p>The ball was then abruptly snapped to halfback Corey Clement who ran left until he lateral passed possession to tight end Trey Burton.</p>\n<p>All the meanwhile Foles had sneakily walked unmarked into the right side of the goal line, then catching the easy touchdown pass from Burton.</p>\n<p>I’ll be honest, I screamed at the top of my lungs when I saw this entire maneuver get pulled off on the big screen in real-time.</p>\n<p>As the halftime whistle was blown, the Eagles entered the locker room with a lead of 22-12 and were just two full quarters away from the franchise’s biggest victory ever.</p>\n<p>Entering the third, Brady had a point to prove, likely relating to his moniker of ‘the Comeback Kid.’</p>\n<p>He ended the first possession of the new half with a darting touchdown pass to his favorite target in tight end Rob Gronkowski, bringing the score to 19-22. Foles then responded on the following drive with a touchdown pass of his own to Clement and expanded the Eagles’ lead once more to 29-19, but it was still a game that could burst wide open at any second.</p>\n<p>Then, as if the current trend was a surprise to anyone, Brady brought it back to within a score by way of touchdown pass to wide receiver Chris Hogan. The 4th quarter whistle would then bring the game to its most crucial point as time appeared to slow down entirely in this for the most part fast paced game.</p>\n<p>The Eagles started the last quarter of the match with a long field goal kick courtesy of Elliott, Philadelphia lead 32-26.</p>\n<p>On the next drive, Brady knew a touchdown would be enough to earn the Patriots the lead and shift the momentum in his side’s favor.</p>\n<p>Considering this game broke the record for most offensive yards in a Super Bowl back in the 3rd quarter, this possession was no different as Brady had his team travel down the field as he once again delivered a touchdown pass to Gronkowski.</p>\n<p>Down for the first time since the field goal exchange in the first quarter, Foles and the Eagles needed one last feat of skillful endurance as the clock wound down with the score still at 32-33.<br>\nClutch player spoiler, here comes Zach Ertz.</p>\n<p>Following a pair of first-down catches made by Ertz himself, the star tight end went on to catch the game-winning score that put Philadelphia up 38-33 late in the game.</p>\n<p>The two-point conversion failed but that didn’t matter because it was still all hands on deck regardless if the Eagles defense had any chance of stopping Brady and his bunch.</p>\n<p>Then, the greatest defensive play in Eagles history occurred right before everyone’s eyes.</p>\n<p>“Brady gets hit, the ball is out!” yelled play-by-play announcer Kevin Harlan as Philadelphia defensive end Brandon Graham strips possession away from the New England quarterback’s grasp.</p>\n<p>The ball ended up getting recovered by Eagles first-round drafted rookie Derek Barnett and his side was now in prime position to run out the clock and earn their first ever Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>Goosebumps ran rampant on both sides’ fans as each hoped for the best. Ultimately the Patriots would go on to hold the Eagles to only a field goal, but used up all their timeouts in the process.</p>\n<p>With the score at 41-33 and the clock within the final minute of play, the Eagles just needed a single defensive stop on downs.</p>\n<p>Playing deep in their own secondary, the Eagles only allowed Brady to get into a Hail Mary passing range as the whole nation held its breath for the last play of Super Bowl 52.</p>\n<p>They had done it. It was over.</p>\n<p>The Eagles had won.</p>\n<p>The final play resulted in that Hail Mary pass and the obvious target of Gronkowski’s huge frame was covered by six different Eagles cornerbacks.</p>\n<p>As the failed ball fell on the ground, so did all the green confetti.</p>\n<p>It was a night to remember for a new dynasty, and a night to forget for the old dynasty.</p>\n<p>We can all now breathe a sigh of relief Eagles fans; we made it into the circle of champions.</p>\n<p>Hopes were high for this glorious match and hopes will remain high as our team’s future remains bright with the help of both Wentz and Foles, the young and experienced star core on both offense and defense, as well as the coaching and administrative talents involved with the Eagles organization. Now as the offseason approaches and we let this win sink in, all I have to say is one last thing… Go Birds.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Feb. 22</em><em>, 2018, edition

Unranked UC San Diego is 8-6 on the year, and before their most recent win against Lindenwood, they were managing a four-game losing streak.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine and UCSB already played once this season, which resulted in a 3-1 road victory for the Gauchos. Meanwhile, this will be Santa Barbara’s first meeting with UC San Diego, as both teams are set to play in the first conference matchup in league history.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter David Wieczorek now leads his team in the kills stat over fellow senior outside hitter Colby Harriman; Wieczorek holds a kill total of 113 with a per set ratio of 4.04, whereas Harriman has a 110 kill total and a per set ratio of 2.89.</p>\n<p>If including their third-place teammate, senior outside hitter Alex Harthaller, this dynamic trio account for a whopping grand total of 326 kills for Pepperdine. Their impressive freshman setter Robert Mullahey still remains in the fold as Pepperdine’s primary playmaker with a total of 409 assists on the year.</p>\n<p>For UC San Diego, there is only one clear-cut offensive mind as their kill stat leader, senior opposite Tanner Syftestad, holds an immense total of 262 and a 5.04 per set ratio.</p>\n<p>At 6’8” and 215 lbs, Syftestad also occasionally doubles as a setter for his side. His kill total and per-set ratio stats are also league-leading as he finds himself in the respective first spots in Big West rankings. Paired with the setting talents of senior setter Milosh Stojcic, who leads his team with 542 assists, UCSB will have to plan for an opposing strategy that will surely focus on Stojcic frequently feeding the ball to Syftestad.</p>\n<p>While UCSB will be facing top talent this week, it boasts some great talent as well. Junior outside hitter Corey Chavers became the fourth Gaucho to record 24 kills since 2009 when he tallied 24 against Pepperdine in their first meeting.  That performance went on to earn him player of the week honors.</p>\n<p>Overall, Chavers has been solid for the ‘Chos, averaging 3.78 kills per set, which ranks fifth in the conference and 13th in the nation among qualified players.</p>\n<p>All-time, UCSB has compiled just a 39-68 overall mark against the Waves but will look to continue to improve upon that overall following their previous win.</p>\n<p>Against the Tritons, the Gauchos have defeated their new Big West foes 38 times of their 46 total meetings, including their wins in the last 10 matchups between the two squads.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will host Pepperdine this Wednesday, Feb. 21, at 7 p.m. They will also host the Friday, Feb. 23, conference matchup against UC San Diego, also at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions all weekend long for the UCSB men’s volleyball team as it was just recently on the road for two back-to-back matches against Brigham Young University.</p>\n<p>UCSB split its pair of matches against the Cougars, leaving the Gauchos with a 4-4 record. It managed to pull off an impressive 3-0 shutout over BYU on Friday, but couldn’t sustain the momentum as it was shutout itself the following Saturday. BYU is now 6-4.</p>\n<p>The first set of Friday’s first match was quite the offensive spectacle as both teams were making the most of almost every attacking opportunity. Although, the Gauchos were able to run away with it by a close 25-23 end result; with four kills each from UCSB’s sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders, sophomore outside hitter Roy McFarland, and junior outside hitter Corey Chavers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In the second set, each sides’ defense started to tighten up and the improvements were shown as a total of 6 blocks, 3 apiece, were recorded. For the Gauchos, the standout performer in this one was sophomore setter Randy DeWeese who posted up two of those three blocks from his playmaker position. DeWeese would go on and also conclude the day with a game high of 4 total blocks to go along with his 31 team assists. UCSB would then go on to clinch this second set by a score of 25-20.</p>\n<p>By this point the BYU Cougars were on the ropes and left their best for last in an attempt to cancel out the away side’s clean sweep. Nearing the end of the third set, the Gauchos were down by only a pair of scores as the board read 21-23. Then, thanks to a flurry of attack errors and a service mistake is what ultimately decided the game as the Gauchos would then go on and set up the final 27-25 score to earn both the road victory and clean 3-0 set sweep over the No. 6 BYU.</p>\n<p>As for Saturday’s game two, which took place the next evening, UCSB was in search of pulling off a sweep over their opponents whilst still in enemy territory. Set No. 1 seemed to go in favor of the Gauchos for most of the way, yet failure to halt BYU’s .600 hitting percentage in the first set eventually gave the Cougars the early 1-0 lead to start the match.</p>\n<p>Set two experienced a complete advantage for BYU as their freshman opposite hitter Gabi Garcia Fernandez put up 6 total kills. This one got out of the Gauchos reach early on as the Cougars never gave up the lead through it all and secured the 25-20 victory.</p>\n<p>Then for the final set, the Gauchos gave it their all but an outstanding defensive performance from the other side of the court held them to a .138 hitting percentage and a doubled amount of blocks to go with. Disappointingly, UCSB then lost the day by a final result of 0-3 as back to back sweeps were experienced on both ends in just a matter of two days. Aggregate team stats show the Gauchos hitting for a cumulative .263 hitting percentage, 11.5 blocks, and 6 aces; compared to the Cougars’ .337 hitting percentage average, 16.5 blocks, and 6 aces as well.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s volleyball program will continue its 2018 regular season on Wednesday, Feb. 21, with a home game against Pepperdine just before the first conference matchup of the year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80851\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80851\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/no-14-gauchos-end-visit-to-provo-with-a-split-against-no-6-byu/","id":4941,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[4940,4939,4938],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 14 Gauchos Drop Second-Straight While on the Road at Lewis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2018-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB was unable to get back on the winning track against the Lewis Flyers.

At first, the Gauchos’ attack seemed to be firing on all cylinders. Although, it wasn’t until the final half of play that Gaucho mistakes started allowing the point gap to close in. Then soon after, UCSB allowed their 23-20 lead to falter as the Loyola Wolves clinched an upset set victory following their impressive come back.</p>\n<p>The second set featured an even closer affair as an almost countless number of lead changes were experienced. A total of 16 different tie games were observed and this set seemed like it could have gone either way. Unfortunately, it once again was claimed by the Loyola home side following three consecutive serving errors from the visiting Gauchos.</p>\n<p>In order to stay in the game, UCSB needed to extend the match by winning this following set. With a staggering hitting percentage difference of UCSB’s .265 to Loyola’s .086, the Gauchos reignited their potent attacking force. The set eventually resulted in a 25-18 score favoring UCSB.</p>\n<p>In order to force a fifth set, the Gauchos would have needed to take this next set as well. However, a dominant 8 point streak by the host around the halfway mark of the set gave Loyola the advantage they needed in order to put this meet to bed. With the Gauchos hitting a game low percentage of .050, the final set’s score tallying in at 25-17, Loyola had done it and sent the Gauchos home with only their 2<sup>nd</sup> loss of the regular season.</p>\n<p>Team leaders for this match once again included Chavers, who totaled 18 kills for UCSB. Combined, the team’s middle blockers of Sanders and red shirt sophomore Brandon Hopper also put up another 18 kills. Sophomore setter Randy DeWeese also got the job done once more with 39 assists.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to return to their winning ways this Saturday, Jan. 27, as they head away from home to face the Lewis University Flyers at noon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80633\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-no-7-wolves/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80633\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-no-7-wolves/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-no-7-wolves/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-no-7-wolves/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-no-7-wolves/","id":4940,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[4939,4938,4937],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Volleyball Remains on the Road for Match Against Loyola (Ill.)","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FilePhoto-2017.01.20_StephenManga_MVolleyball-8-web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FilePhoto-2017.01.20_StephenManga_MVolleyball-8-web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hopes to continue to ride its current two-match win streak heading into the weekend.

In the end, there will be several great matches to watch here, and by several we only mean all three of Brazil’s games.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Group F: Germany, Mexico, Sweden, South Korea</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Champions Draw the Group of Death</em></p>\n<p>The “Group of Death” is pretty self-explanatory as is, but for the sake of learning it is considered the most competitive and unpredictable group. Regardless, the German team has been the poster boy for elite football for several years now, especially after coming off winning the World Cup. As for Mexico and Sweden, it may very well come down to either of them as they’ll try to secure the second spot in this group. Although, the last time we underestimated South Korea, they somehow made it to the World Cup semifinal…and then were beat by Germany.</p>\n<p><strong>Group G: Belgium, England, Tunisia, Panama</strong></p>\n<p><em>England Just Might Get the Job Done</em></p>\n<p>There’s always a recurring meme that circulates around this time that pretty much revolves around the fact that England invented this sport, yet still sucks at it. However, after the group stage drawing, fans of England should rejoice. Tunisia and Panama aren’t near the Top 16 rankings of both England and Belgium, so there might just be a chance for England. “A chance” being the key phrase here, since Tunisia or Panama might very well join Belgium in advancing out of the group stage, and we wouldn’t even consider it an upset result.<br>\nWe’d apologize for this banter toward England, but banter would mean the exchange of teasing remarks. However, since the U.S. didn’t even qualify (yes, we’re still mad) over the likes of No. 53 Panama, we’ll just sit back and practice our cockney accents. Good luck to our friends from across the pond.</p>\n<p><strong>Group H: Poland, Colombia, Senegal, Japan</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Most Balanced of All</em></p>\n<p>Now that we’ve gotten the entertainment factor out in this article, it’s time to return to a very balanced and wholesome drawn group analysis. This might very well be the most wide open group out of all the competitors, and it might very well be the only group in which the first pot selection doesn’t advance. Japan is the lowest ranked here at 56th overall; however, Poland, Colombia and Senegal are all well within range of each other in the FIFA rankings. Therefore, don’t be surprised when any of these teams top their group.<br>\nIt’s still way too early to accurately and efficiently predict who will succeed come this next FIFA World Cup. Still, we’ll make the educated guess of having Brazil and Germany as the two favorites of the entire tourney. Stay tuned as more updates will come as the greatest stage in world football nears its arrival.<br>\nTo recap, here are the results of the drawing once again as well as our early Top-2 picks in asterisks:</p>\n<p><strong>Group A: *Russia, *Uruguay, Egypt, Saudi Arabia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group B: *Portugal, *Spain, Iran, Morocco</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group C: *France, *Peru, Denmark, Australia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group D: *Argentina, Croatia, Iceland, *Nigeria</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group E: *Brazil, Switzerland, *Costa Rica, Serbia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group F: *Germany, *Mexico, Sweden, South Korea</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group G: *Belgium, *England, Tunisia, Panama</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Group H: Poland, *Colombia, *Senegal, Japan</strong></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80608\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80608\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/","id":3383,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3382,3381,3380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"X’s and O’s: Breaking Down the 2018 FIFA World Cup Groups (A-D)","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2018-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/worldcup.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/worldcup.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Lots of buzz in the sports world for this year is due to the 2018 FIFA World Cup beginning this summer in June.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup, set to take place in Russia, has recently been all the talk around the world. After years of qualification matches and cheering on their international side, fans of the beautiful game are celebrating their nation’s ticket to the biggest stage in world football.<br>\nFortunately, the wait until the summer of 2018 won’t be too uneventful thanks to the World Cup drawing event that recently took place at the start of December. Now, with the group stage set and tensions high, the country comparisons will start to occur as analysts will weigh each team’s chances at advancing past the group stage. This leads me to my unbiased predictions of the drawing’s results … especially since the United States didn’t qualify.</p>\n<p><strong>Group A: Russia, Uruguay, Egypt, Saudi Arabia</strong></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>The Hosts Draw a Favorable Batch</em></p>\n<p>For those not in the know concerning the World Cup’s group draw, each team, excluding the host nation, which is always granted the first slot, starts off placed in a competitive pot that is shared with other teams of nearly similar FIFA men’s rankings. So, for informational purposes, every group is ordered by skill level as listed.<br>\nThe host nation of Russia is a part of the first four designated sides. Uruguay and Egypt are the Top 30 teams in Russia’s way, while Saudi Arabia is ranked just below them. Historically speaking, host nations tend to perform well at their World Cups, even if they are undervalued on paper, as in Russia’s case. Nevertheless, we see Uruguay and Russia going through unless Egypt has something to say about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Group B: Portugal, Spain, Iran, Morocco</strong></p>\n<p><em>Two Giants, Two Dreams</em></p>\n<p>Both Portugal and Spain have been considered Top 10 in world football for years now. However, if you’re asking FIFA, they’re even better. Coming in at No. 3 and No. 6 respectively, Portugal and Spain appear to be clear-cut favorites to stand at the top of their groups when all is said and done. Unless a pair of upset losses occur within this group stage, the Top-35 side Iran and closely following Morocco won’t have much of a chance due to all the star power on the opposition. Nevertheless, the Portugal vs. Spain match should provide a must-watch competition for all fans alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Group C: France, Peru, Denmark, Australia</strong></p>\n<p><em>A Battle for Positioning</em></p>\n<p>At a quick glance, one may make the mistake to simply jump to the conclusion that France has this one in the bag. Think again. Ranked at No. 9 overall, France barely holds a lead in the standings when considering Peru is placed at 11th next to 12th place Denmark. Peru is hungry for a good group stage finish after not qualifying for the World Cup for 36 years, and Denmark is a source for quality talent amongst Europe’s elite clubs. Sure, we’ll cheer on the Australian underdogs, but it seems like France will have its work cut out when having to deal with a group that is capable of top-tier play.</p>\n<p><strong>Group D: Argentina, Croatia, Iceland, Nigeria</strong></p>\n<p><em>Messi is No Group Stage Guarantee</em></p>\n<p>Yes, you read that right: “Messi is no group stage guarantee.” Why would we word the headline as such? Well, this Argentina team has played fairly average whenever Messi is absent from the roster. Is this a lack of performance from a side full of star power, or are they just simply missing the best player in world football? Regardless of the correct answer, this group is still very much competitive considering its circumstances. Croatia is home to some of the best football-playing athletes, and Iceland is truly living a Cinderella story of success. And, oh yeah, the 51st ranked Nigeria just came off a 4-2 thrashing over the No. 4 overall Argentina. We’ll still give it just barely to Argentina, followed by perhaps the most surprising of all the group stages’ victors: Nigeria.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Jan. 25</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-a-d/","id":3382,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[3381,3380,3379],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces Pepperdine in First Road Match of 2018","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2018-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FilePhoto-2017.01.20_StephenManga_MVolleyball-8-web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FilePhoto-2017.01.20_StephenManga_MVolleyball-8-web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Three games into the season, the UCSB men's volleyball team rolls onward into its first road match of the year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Three games into the season, the UCSB men’s volleyball team rolls onward into its first road match of the year. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Gauchos have so far shown plenty to be excited about following their 3-0 thrashing at home versus the No. 8 Stanford during the Asics Invitational.

At 6’6”, Harthaller is second on the overall kill point count for his team at 22 so far on the season; he also averages a 3.67 kill per set ratio along with a hitting percentage of .286. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Meanwhile, Harriman leads Pepperdine with a first place kill point count of 24; paired with a 3.43 kill per set ratio and a .204 hitting percentage. These two players have so far proven that they are reliable targets when it comes to getting points up on the board. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Look for new primary setter Robert Mullahey to get them going early as the 6’4” squad athlete will look to get his two outside hitters going early on. With 80 assists through his first two games, watch for the game script to revolve around his success or lack thereof.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As for the Gauchos, their two starting outside hitters have also been very productive. Sophomore Roy McFarland and junior Corey Chavers both lead as well in the kill point count for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> McFarland currently tallies a total of 33 kills, a 3.00 kill per set ratio, and an impressive hitting percentage of .397. As for his teammate, Chavers leads his team unit with 36 overall; including a 3.27 kill per set ratio, and a .240 hitting percentage. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In terms of their setters, UCSB have been rotating in and out two different players in Randy DeWeese and Casey McGarry. So far DeWeese has received the bulk of control with a total of 62 assists on the season; whereas McGarry is following close behind at 50 assists overall.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Historically speaking, UCSB hasn’t had much success over Pepperdine considering their all time record of 38-68. Last year even featured a 1-3 loss for the Gauchos where they were also on the road against Pepperdine.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In terms of current Gaucho standings, the team ranks 3</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>rd</sup></span><span class=\"s1\"> in the Big West conference for both the statistical categories of blocking, 2.64 per game, and digs, 8.36 per game. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nationally speaking however, these Gaucho scoring stats have also booked them a top-15 standing in blocking at No. 7, No. 11 in attacks per game with 27.6, and No. 12 in serving with 1.73 aces per game.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Overall, the UCSB Men’s Volleyball team is shaping up to be something special this year. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Considering their Big West competitors of Long Beach State, CSUN, and Hawai’i are currently all undefeated so far in preseason play, the Gauchos still have a while to go before asserting league dominance; not to mention that UC Irvine and UC San Diego are also both above a .800 win percentage.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">UCSB will face off away from home this Saturday, January 20</span><span class=\"s2\"><sup>th</sup></span><span class=\"s1\">, at 6 PM; the host Pepperdine will hold the match in their Firestone Fieldhouse athletic facility.      </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80544\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-19/ucsb-faces-pepperdine-in-first-road-match-of-2018/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80544\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-19/ucsb-faces-pepperdine-in-first-road-match-of-2018/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-19/ucsb-faces-pepperdine-in-first-road-match-of-2018/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-19/ucsb-faces-pepperdine-in-first-road-match-of-2018/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-19/ucsb-faces-pepperdine-in-first-road-match-of-2018/","id":4939,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[4938,4937,4936],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Will Close Season at UCI","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A chance to end the 2017 season 8-8 in conference play is on the line for the UCSB women's volleyball team going into its final match against UC Irvine.

This accounted for almost a third of the team’s entire total digs versus the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>As for the offensive front, a standout performance was observed by star sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins who put up a whopping 32 kills. This stat-line helped lead her team to a .268 hitting percentage, almost twice as much as the Anteaters’; not to mention Ruddins also impressively leads the NCAA with a 5.91 average kills per set tally.</p>\n<p>Concerning the Anteaters’ side, junior outside hitter Haley DeSales proved to be the team MVP as she once again seemed to fly all over the court. Last time out she was tied for a game-leading six blocks.</p>\n<p>Notably, DeSales also continues to be productive offensively as she has the second most total kills for Irvine at 318. The Gauchos’ coaching staff would be wise to keep DeSales in their plans as they game script may revolve around her and the amount of opportunities she’ll receive.</p>\n<p>Key factors for the Gauchos to improve upon would be better first touch passes to the setter, as last time they settled for only five setter assists, as well as imposing their blocking prowess early on in hopes of avoiding another close 5-set match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will head down to host side UC Irvine this Tuesday, Nov. 21 at 7 p.m. for their last match of the 2017 season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/womens-volleyball-will-close-season-at-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/womens-volleyball-will-close-season-at-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/womens-volleyball-will-close-season-at-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/womens-volleyball-will-close-season-at-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/womens-volleyball-will-close-season-at-uci/","id":4968,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[4967,4966,4965],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Eagles Aren’t as Good as You Think, They’re Actually Better","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Eagles.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Eagles.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Now beyond the halfway point of the NFL season, the Philadelphia Eagles have the best record in the league at 8-1.

But as any hardcore Eagles fan will tell you, don’t say Super Bowl just yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Injuries, and Lots of Them</strong></p>\n<p>Many factors come into play when analyzing the current success of this Eagles squad. However, a good place to start would be the team’s ability to overcome several injuries to very key positions.</p>\n<p>In Week 1, star cornerback Ronald Darby, former PFF Rookie Defensive Player of the Year, went down with a dislocated right ankle injury, sidelining him all season thus far.</p>\n<p>Two games later, running back Darren Sproles tore his ACL and broke his arm, eliminating perhaps the Eagles’ best playmaker at the time. Week 7 signaled the season-ending loses of two pivotal players as future Hall of Famer left tackle Jason Peters was carted off and middle linebacker sensation Jordan Hicks was locker room-bound.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the countless roadblocks that Philadelphia has had to deal with. Yet, considering they’ve made it this far and have still managed a best in the league performance week in and week out, the Eagles are really promoting a “next one up” mentality throughout their roster of players.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Darby and second-round draft pick Sidney Jones IV are due back any time now, meaning that the Eagles defensive productivity will soon match their offensive output. So word to the wise, no longer should only the NFC East be afraid, but the entire NFL should be as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Next-One-Up </strong></p>\n<p>This phrased mindset refers to how well a team’s substitutes and second-string players can acclimate and produce when called upon following injuries to starters. More specifically, how well Philadelphia’s depth chart has adjusted to such mishaps has been a dimension of its momentum.</p>\n<p>Starting with the cornerbacks, former seventh-round pick Jalen Mills has played solidly through his sophomore year with three interceptions and one “pick-six” touchdown return. Veteran corner Patrick Robinson was brought in to help as a rotational player, yet he is now graded as the No. 3 CB with a PFF defensive grade of 91.2.</p>\n<p>As for the receiving corps, Nelson Agholor has done a complete 180 in terms of his poor performance last year. With 428 yards and five touchdowns through nine games, Agholor can definitely be considered a candidate for the NFL’s Most Improved award. Meanwhile, fourth-string wide receiver Mack Hollins has shown some flashy playmaking ability while only being a fourth-round steal of a rookie.</p>\n<p>Concerning the team’s run game, this is where the Eagles have most notably gone off, even with Sproles’s absence.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the many talents of LeGarrette Blount, Corey Clement and Wendell Smallwood, the Eagles are fourth in the NFL in rushing yards per game with a 136.8 average. Oh, and they recently traded for pro-bowl running back Jay Ajayi.</p>\n<p>Altogether, this is a team that wants to win, and their coaching staff will do their best to appropriately rotate everyone into the play scheme.</p>\n<p><strong>The Art of the Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s back track a little bit and comprehend just how much of a robbery it was when the Eagles traded one of their three fourth-round picks to the Miami Dolphins for Ajayi. With a year of NFL play under his belt, Ajayi exploded onto the NFL scene last season.</p>\n<p>Ajayi has already been to the Pro Bowl and was considered as high as a top-five running back talent entering the 2017-18 season. So one must begin to question how on Earth a player of Ajayi’s caliber, who averaged 4.9 yards per carry last year, managed to be practically gifted to the Eagles.</p>\n<p>Simply put, the answer is Howie Roseman, who is the executive vice president of Philadelphia’s football operations.</p>\n<p>Roseman has pretty much been the brains behind most of the great Eagles’ trades since this past offseason. With him bringing in names such as Alshon Jeffery, LeGarrette Blount, Timmy Jernigan and Ronald Darby, it’s clear to see that the office personnel has placed the team in a position to succeed with their key decision-making.</p>\n<p>In turn, Head Coach Doug Pederson and defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz have done their best to play these free agents and new players.</p>\n<p>Altogether, it’s paid off thus far. Philadelphia’s current outlook is very bright, as the team is spearheaded by the potential league MVP in second-year quarterback Carson Wentz.</p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, the Super Bowl is in the back of fans’ and players’ minds alike, and the excitement is definitely brewing as the wins keep stacking up.</p>\n<p>However, there’s still much of the season left, and topping the Eagles’ list of priorities would be ensuring a first-round bye come postseason time.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Nov. 16, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79752\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79752\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/the-eagles-arent-as-good-as-you-think-theyre-actually-better/","id":1882,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1881,1880,1879],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Triumph at Harder: Gauchos Upset by UCR in First Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-11-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/HallieBrown_MSoc_vsCalPoly-20171014-16-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/HallieBrown_MSoc_vsCalPoly-20171014-16-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"When all was said and done, the UCSB men's soccer team could really only blame itself following its loss to UCR Wednesday night.

After a game that was mostly dominated by a Gaucho offense, the Highlander defense proved too stingy to allow any more than several shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, no Gaucho attempts hit the back of the net and all Riverside needed was one in order to shock their opponents; and that they did as their window of opportunity presented itself in the 87<sup>th</sup> minute of play.</p>\n<p>Thus, the men’s soccer season has now come to a conclusion. Besides a foul ridden game and countless rotational substitutions, not much went for either team throughout the entire match.</p>\n<p>The first save of the night came fairly early as Gaucho freshman forward Sahid Conteh landed a sweeping shot that was covered by Highlander goalkeeper Vincent Morales. UCSB’s following shot was even closer than the previous as a well placed header by midfielder Joseph Ammer collided with the post in the 13<sup>th</sup> minute. For the rest of the first half the Gauchos dominated the majority of possession, but without another key opportunity it remained quiet and scoreless.</p>\n<p>Following the second whistle signaling the second half start, a combined 19 substitutions were made during play as both head coaches sought after any switch that may tip the balance of the game in their favor. Soon after, it was Sanchez’ score that sent UCSB’s ‘Soccer Heaven’ into a state of shock as the Gauchos fell victim to an early round exit.</p>\n<p>Harder Stadium was gloomy as the game-winning goal took the breath out of everyone and the final whistle sounded. Exhausted Gaucho players fell on top of the pitch as the Highlanders celebrated their biggest upset of the year.</p>\n<p>The severity of the loss was evident as Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg spoke to his team on the field rather than in the locker room.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a trying and challenging season with lots of issues, going all the way back to Kevin [Feucht] getting hurt … so we’ve been playing catch up all year,” he said. “We went the first six games scoring three goals, the first three games scoring no goals, and ironically we ended the season just how we started it.”</p>\n<p>The coach’s words rang true as the Gauchos lack of offense decided not only the result of the postseason match, but several others throughout the year. Regardless of controlling the rhythm of games and minimizing opponents’ time of possession, the Gauchos just seemed to be missing that playmaking ability in the final third of their season.</p>\n<p>“Tonight, we were getting close but frankly I got nothing from my bench tonight. No one came off the bench tonight and helped us, and that was my biggest disappointment,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ head coach would then go on and mention the importance of finding some bench production within their current 27-man roster. Altogether, hopes still remain high for this young and very talented UCSB roster.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the offseason, the team will work on adding the playmakers required in order to add to their future season’s total goal tally. For now, the Gauchos must put this loss behind them and focus on developing their star underclassmen as they shape the future of the UCSB men’s soccer program.</p><div

team’s disappointing 4-1 loss to archrival Cal Poly on the road, the UCSB men’s soccer team saw one positive come out of last weekend and that was the 3-0 loss that third place Sac State experienced to UC Davis; meaning that the second place seed was no longer up for grabs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, UCSB’s 15 total points in the standings have the team at 2<sup>nd</sup> overall on the Big West league table and the Big West North. The winner of the Big West South, Cal State Fullerton, only finished with 14 points.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the Gauchos’ regular season campaign featured a conference record of 4-3-3. The team proved to be inconsistent at times whether it is at home or on the road, but dominant enough to net them yet another playoff berth. Overall, the Gauchos finished 6-7-5.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Concerning statistic, the team only totaled 13 goals across nine matches, yet held opposing sides to 17 scores against them. However, as much as this speaks volumes for both the offensive and defensive sides for the Gauchos, the team still can cherish a combined 3 clean sheets on the year to go with their quarterfinalist position.</p>\n<p>When reflecting back at previous analysis to commence the season; not many would’ve figured UC Davis to have topped not only their division but also the entire Big West board.</p>\n<p>This is due in part because of their early first-round exit in last year’s playoff. Nonetheless, the Aggies appear to be the team to beat and the Gauchos have yet to beat them even after two encounters this season. In fact, UCSB was outscored in those two contests 8-0.</p>\n<p>Now, UCSB will look ahead to their first-round opponents as they draw UC Riverside at home to kick off the postseason. The Highlanders finished their collegiate season with an overall record of 4-12-1 and 4-5-1 Big West.</p>\n<p>One of those five conference losses came in an out of division matchup, on the road, against UCSB. The result was ultimately a 3-1 victory for the Gauchos, but thanks to the whopping 10 total saves from UC Riverside’s goalkeeper Vincent Morales, the score didn’t run up anymore.</p>\n<p>Besides a very talented goalie, the Highlanders also boast a fairly prolific goal scorer in junior forward Antonio Lokossou.</p>\n<p>He currently leads his team in the goals category with a total 5 tallies and also maintains the most shots at goal with 26 on the season. Paired with the team assist team leader of sophomore forward Anthony Lopez who has three helpers and two goals to his name, the Gauchos would be wise to game plan with these two in mind.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, Rodney Michael once again stepped up for his time and netted the redemption score in their previous 4-1 loss. On the year, Michael continues to lead his team in both categories with eight goals and three assists (tied with Ignacio Tellechea).</p>\n<p>Easily claiming the team’s regular season MVP consideration, his success also extends to a league level as he is tied for second most Big West goals scored and third most shots taken.</p>\n<p>Michael also earned Big West Freshman of the Year and Big West All-First Team Honors.</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Alan Carrillo will also be a big key to the Gauchos postseason success if they enjoy any. The La Mirada native has allowed nine of his 24 goals allowed in the last three games.</p>\n<p>His 1.27 goals against average still rank fourth in the Big West, and his 50 total saves rank sixth, however, he must play better if he hopes to lead the Gauchos to the semifinals.</p>\n<p>He, alongside Michael, was named to the Big West All-Freshman Team while senior defender Randy Mendoza was named to the All-Big West Second Team.</p>\n<p>With a hopefully continued success through the postseason, and if the Gauchos could relocate their once solid defensive line, then UCSB can very well consider a deep run in the Big West playoff race.</p>\n<p>From here on out it’s simple, single elimination games and Wednesday’s victors will land themselves a ticket to Saturday’s semifinal games; thus propelling them that much closer to the following week’s Big West Finals and that coveted championship title.</p>\n<p>Big West early round championship locations still remain on campus sites, so the Gauchos will be hosting UC Riverside this Wednesday, November 1<sup>st</sup>, at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79468\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79468\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-01/mens-soccer-hosts-uc-riverside-in-big-west-first-round-bout/","id":1512,"author":{"id":18,"name":"Richard Benites"},"related":[1511,1510,1509],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":5,"highestPage":8,"route":"/authors/18"}},"__N_SSG":true}
