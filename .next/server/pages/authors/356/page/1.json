When a group of college kids get together and learn the business of planning, budgeting, scheduling and reaching out to talent, magic happens. But at this year’s Reel Loud, the 24th anniversary of the adored silent film festival — gosh, I hate to say it — the student coordination wasn’t as seamless as it could have been.</p>\n<p>First, the MCs were a bit awkward and lacked enthusiasm. Perhaps they were nervous or placed in at the last second, but the role of an MC is to butter up the crowd with corny jokes and provide easy transitions for performing acts. Reel Loud’s MCs did nothing of the sort and committed the ultimate MC crime: pronouncing names incorrectly. It was awful to listen to ten minutes of “Shag-nes-sai” when the silent auction winners were announced. Of course, it was impossible to do a night-before practice of winners’ names, but a five minute run-through before stepping out onstage would have done wonders.</p>\n<p>Another issue at Reel Loud was that parts of it were just plain random. DJ Allie from KCSB 91.9 FM came onstage in between Act I and II, and sat herself on a stool with a Macbook on her lap. She proceeded to play a 15 minute mash-up of famous movie lines and electric beats. The set featured flavorful movie throwbacks like “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” but the DJ’s placement atop a stool in the middle of the stage was random at best and boring at worst. DJ Allie is an enormously talented individual who runs KCSB, but having her sit cross-legged with a laptop and a spotlight shining on her pigtails was not the most entertaining situation at a film festival. Perhaps she could’ve been given a table to lean on and dance around, like a concert DJ.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But the most uncomfortable part of the night was when a music professor came onstage to grant music video legend Wayne Isham with the Inspiring Alumni Award. The music professor meant well, but his history lecture on MTV changing lives and how all Isham needed for his video for “Girls, Girls, Girls” was “motorcycles, girls — better yet — strippers,” was a little out of control. He kept going on and on with his life story, and kept getting cut off by a guy on the sidelines. It was painfully awkward to watch, like when your mother tries to be groovy and tells your friends she’s into wearing thongs now, like the underwear kind. Bleh, mom.</p>\n<p>When Isham finally hit the stage, he smoothed the crunchy peanut butter moment and stole the microphone. “I am so proud to be a fucking Gaucho,” he roared to the crowd. Isham is one badass cool dude who has directed classic videos for everyone from Metallica to Backstreet Boys. The music video legend lavished the films with compliments and made everyone feel good about themselves.</p>\n<p>“I sat back in my chair and went — oh. My fucking god! You’ve got THAT going on here! The music department kicks ass, the film department kicks ass. I am so proud to be a Gaucho,” Isham said, his gruff voice roaring out from beneath a thick beard. Long golden-gray hair shook around his face as he talked. The man looked straight out of Hells Angels and muttered f-bombs like there was no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“YOU inspire me. Forget about being alumni inspiration, I’m talking about the new generation. The new generation! You guys fucking rock … I need to start a new production company right here … this event was mind-blowing.”</p>\n<p>Given that Isham is a star director — the man did “Livin’ La Vida Loca” — his assessment of Reel Loud holds great weight. And in all honesty, the event’s content was pretty good. Art displays mixed with refreshments and a silent auction provided entertainment before the reels spun. Performances by a capella groups Vocal Motion and Brothas From Otha Mothas were met with a warm reception. The event itself — a silent film festival accompanied by live music — is a fantastic concept, and was executed as smoothly as 12 films with 12 different bands could.</p>\n<p>The films were short. Each was under seven minutes and was accompanied by a live ensemble. A favorite was “Choices,” a film by fourth-year physics major Michael Shaughnessy and second-year English major Kayla Barajas. “Choices” portrayed a hospitalized young man as he tried to replay what decisions he made which led to his accident. Heavy guitar strums built energy that complemented the fast scene changes.</p>\n<p>Other notable films included “Ten Toes,” which shows a man with the embarrassing problem of squeaky feet, and “Holy Grail,” a black-and-white movie about a depressed man who digs up a treasure chest that gives the gift of confidence. “Holy Grail” had the good fortune of having a soundtrack written by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-15/azeem-ward-overnight-flute-sensation/\">Azeem Ward</a>, the world-famous flautist.</p>\n<p>The reel that took home all the glory was “Out,” a cinematic creation by Emma Manley and Stefan Le. “Out” was Manley’s coming out story, and shows her chopping off her hair as she embraces her gender fluidity. It was beautifully shot with brilliant angles, and won the audience choice, cinematography and Scott Wells golden reel awards.</p>\n<p>A tender moment arose at the festival when “I.V. Strong” played scenes of last year’s memorial events. Almost exactly a year ago, film and music students were at Reel Loud when they heard the news that six fellow students had been shot. It was the site of disbelief. The inclusion of “I.V. Strong” allowed everyone to take a moment, reflect, and shed a few tears. It proved cathartic, especially when art professor Kim Yasuda came onstage to speak on the BLUNITE I.V. project.</p>\n<p>All in all though, Reel Loud 2015 could have exercised cleaner organization. But what the hell — if Wayne Isham said the event was mind-blowing, it might as well be true.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63944\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63944\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/reel-loud-2015-suffers-from-poor-planning/","id":5909,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[5908,5907,5906],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Live at the Batcave: Pookie","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Pookie. The word means “vagina” in Tagalog and is slang for a heroin pipe.

We just get sweaty,” Fields said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Sweaty, indie, mathy rock,” Mandell chimed in. “That’s what we are, I guess.”</p>\n<p>The quad belongs to Miehl and Fields, two 21-year-olds from the Valley blessed with roommates who allow Pookie to practice at odd hours of the day.

He’s got wavy, dirty-blonde hair, light eyes and a face tanned from surfing. When the rest of the band starts talking shit about I.V. reggae groups, Fields keeps them in check.</p>\n<p>Fields met Staffie, a broad blonde bassist with a predilection for the mandolin and harmonica, through a mutual friend who lived in FT. The two hit it off immediately, and talked music and surfing whenever Staffie came to visit. Fields pressed his two musician buddies to move to Santa Barbara. You could say he’s the glue that brought everyone together, but he prefers the term “lynchpin.”</p>\n<p>Last year, the three jammed at Staffie’s house on Sabado, doing mostly loud instrumental stuff. “Nick and I have always played together and looked for singers. We’re so instrumental. Everyone’s like, ‘Why don’t you have a singer? What’s wrong with you guys?’ Every time a singer came along, it was hard for them,” Miehl said.</p>\n<p>That changed when Mandell bounced into the picture. “The stuff we play is really hard to write lyrics over,” said Staffie. “So I was impressed with how Ryan stepped in and didn’t have a problem.”</p>\n<p>Mandell, with his zany personality and iPhone notes teeming with poetry, quickly melded in as the group’s wild frontman. “The first show we played together [was] the Hackathon. Ryan had never played with us, but I told him to come along. We did a song called ‘Maggot Brain’ — it’s basically a twenty-minute jam of feedback and weird base grooves and guitar solos — and Ryan just [pulled out his iPhone] and started yelling his poetry over it,” Fields said.</p>\n<p>The first show set the tone for how Mandell would step in and manage to sing over the heavy instrumentation. “[Chris and I,] we try to fill so much sound with the two of us. We’re getting used to working with a full band,” said Fields.</p>\n<p>The current group that makes up Pookie has only been playing with each other for a month. But the changeover has been easy. “It’s actually more fluid that it’s ever been,” Miehl said. “Ryan’s such a weirdo, it works out so well.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63166\" style=\"width: 409px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-6.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1534854337\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63240\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63166\" data-attachment-id=\"63166\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/live-at-the-batcave-pookie/pookie_lorenzo-basilio-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-6.jpg?fit=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"399,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429875580\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pookie_Lorenzo Basilio-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-6.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-6.jpg?fit=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63166 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-6.jpg?resize=399%2C600\" alt=\"Nick Fields, Pookie's drummer.

Professor Duffy incited the usual icebreaker, the one where everyone says their name, major and a fun fact. Fields, senior English major, told everyone he was a senior English major that played the drums. Mandell, senior English major, told everyone he was a senior English major, then pointed at Fields and said, “I’m gonna ask that kid to jam later.”</p>\n<p>When Fields left the classroom, Mandell was waiting for him by the door.</p>\n<p>“Let’s jam together,” he said. Fields did what most people do in this situation — said yes, gave his phone number and expected to never actually hang out.<br>\nNowadays, the two hang out regularly.</p>\n<p><strong>BLOWIN’ IT</strong><br>\nSome Friday in late April, Pookie showed up at the <em>Daily Nexus</em> office under Storke Tower and did a Batcave Session. It was an electric set, the first — and probably last — of the <em>Nexus’</em> video series which showcases local talent. The band rolled in around noon and made so much noise in the tiny, windowless room that the videographer insisted on wearing earplugs.</p>\n<p>The social media manager arrived on the scene to post Pookie’s picture on Instagram, and reported that the Chancellor was speaking above Storke Tower and sound was bouncing from the Batcave and disturbing the speech.</p>\n<p>Mandell laughed it off, pulling his unruly hair out of the manbun, and continued to yell the lyrics to “Blowin’ It” into the microphone.<br>\nThirty minutes later, CSOs stood at the entrance to Storke Tower’s stairs, blocking the band’s route to the car.</p>\n<p>“You can’t walk up here — no one is allowed to,” they said. Staffie, carrying his five-foot bass cabinet, got a little irritated. He and the boys grunted and moved the gear out towards the plaza where people were planting citrus trees.</p>\n<p>Then they met Jack Johnson.</p>\n<p>Here for Alumni Weekend, Johnson and his wife, Kim, made an appearance at Storke Plaza with Chancellor Yang to support the Edible Campus Project.<br>\n“Hey, I heard you guys from up there,” Johnson said when he saw Pookie and their gear. “You sounded good.”</p>\n<p>Miehl, Fields, Staffie and Mandell said thanks and introduced themselves.</p>\n<p>“I’m Jack,” Johnson said, good-naturedly, just in case no one knew who he was. Pictures were taken and hands were shook. Mandell invited the Grammy-nominated singer to their show that night.</p>\n<p>“Will there be a keg?” Johnson asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah,” they said. Before taking off, Miehl, the guitarist with the quick wit, gave Johnson a job offer. “Hey Jack, if you ever need another job, you can sing backup for us.”</p>\n<p>After reflecting on the moment for a bit, Mandell, who usually has a goofy smile plastered to his face, looked contemplative. “Jack Johnson, dude. He is such a nice guy. You could just tell. He’s spiritually right in the head.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63163\" style=\"width: 409px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"403105562\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63240\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63163\" data-attachment-id=\"63163\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/live-at-the-batcave-pookie/pookie_lorenzo-basilio-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"399,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429875546\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pookie_Lorenzo Basilio-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?fit=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63163 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-3.jpg?resize=399%2C600\" alt=\"Chris Miehls, Pookie's frontman.

Staffie had gone into work at the frozen section of Trader Joe’s where he and Miehl work 40 hours a week, so it was just the English majors, and they wanted to drink a bit before their show.</p>\n<p>Upon leaving KnB, a skateboarder nearly veered into Fields’ white car and started flipping off the boys. Around the Embarcadero Del Mar bend, the skateboarder taunted Fields, yelling obscenities and waving his middle finger. Mandell stuck his head out the window and yelled, “Hey dude. Lube your butthole.”</p>\n<p>“I’m never going to tell someone to fuck off,” Mandell said. “I’d rather say something ridiculous like ‘lube your butthole.’”</p>\n<p>After parking the car, Fields and Mandell headed towards a house on Oceanside. Clydesdale, Isla Vista’s favorite homeless man with the dancing mustache, rolled up on his low-rider bike.</p>\n<p>“Yo Clyde, you should come to the show tonight,” Mandell said. Clydesdale promised he would try to make it. “I love you boys, keep doing your thing,” he smiled before riding off.</p>\n<p><strong>DRUNKEN ELEPHANTS</strong><br>\nOn a Tuesday night at Woodstock’s, all four members of Pookie came and ordered two pitchers. Miehl and Staffie just got off work at 10 p.m., and Fields finished his work day at Jersey Mike’s Subs. Mandell spent the day emailing publications like <em>Surfer Magazine</em>, asking for a writing job.</p>\n<p>A slew of Pookie’s friends sat around at various tables. Christian “Browns” Arballo, dubbed the band’s manager, came over and yelled in a drunken British accent, “This is the greatest band eveeeeeer. I fucking love this band.”</p>\n<p>Mandell, always the storyteller, was riled up with energy from their last show. Maxing out at 100 people, a backyard on Del Playa became the site of hardcore moshing.<br>\n“This kid in an Abercrombie and Fitch, blue-and-white striped polo, this clean-cut kid, he smacks his head on the floor. He gets right back up, and his teeth are just bleeding, his whole mouth is bleeding and he’s got the biggest smile on his face. He’s running through the crowd doing the Lamb of God mosh. He was loving it. And he wasn’t the only one,” the singer said.</p>\n<p>Moshing and dancing are staples of a Pookie show, and products of a band who knows their audience very well. Most bands have a set list they stick to, a formula that is planned and rehearsed. Pookie plays what they want to feed an audience. Whether that’s a Hendrix cover or the dreamy psychedelic tune “Drunken Elephants,” the high-energy band adapts to its surroundings.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63162\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"856841036\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63240\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63162\" data-attachment-id=\"63162\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/live-at-the-batcave-pookie/pookie_lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429875430\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"14\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0666666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pookie_Lorenzo Basilio-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63162\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>At the end of the day, though, Pookie is just like any other group trying to make it in the cutthroat world of the music industry: musicians trying to get better and better each day.</p>\n<p>In another moment of quiet reflection, Pookie’s frontman took a second to think about what kind of music he hopes Pookie will make.</p>\n<p>“[I want] the music that comes from your deepest, the one that comes from your feet,” Mandell said. “You don’t know where it came from, because it came from your feet into your fingers. When that happens, that’s when you’re living your art.”</p>\n<p>It was a quote that mirrored Pookie’s enormous dedication to music as an art, music as a lifestyle. What was just a drummer and a guitarist duo from L.A. has been made complete with a versatile bassist and the wildest frontman to grace Isla Vista; Pookie, also known as the Tagalog word for vagina, has evolved into a sweaty, mathy, grungy punk rock band. But don’t you dare place them in any specific category — you’ll probably get a “fuck you.”</p>\n<p>Check out Pookie on Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pookie/162850090439627?fref=ts\">facebook.com/pages/Pookie/162850090439627?fref=ts</a>.</p>\n<p>Watch their Batcave Session below.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojcZA5CZTE4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_63169\" style=\"width: 409px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1969705721\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"63240\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63169\" data-attachment-id=\"63169\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-07/live-at-the-batcave-pookie/pookie_lorenzo-basilio-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?fit=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"399,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429875613\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Pookie_Lorenzo Basilio-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?fit=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63169\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?resize=399%2C600\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"399\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pookie_Lorenzo-Basilio-9.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-63169\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zach Stafford, Pookie’s bassist. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus.</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A momma’s boy his whole life, Johnson spent the flight to school from his hometown in Oahu crying tears of homesickness. Now that he was getting into the swing of things, the homesickness was subsiding a little, especially when he spotted a girl named Kim. Intense eye contact was made, so intense that she sat next to him. Kim was a math major gearing up to become a teacher. Tall with light brown eyes, she was a “girl next door” type from Texas. Jack was smitten.</p>\n<p>“I was a momma’s boy … and of course it took me just a week to find a new mom,” Johnson said to a hooting crowd at Corwin Pavilion Friday, April 24. “I mean, [she] did start washing my clothes for me.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to legendary UCSB alumni, no one fits the mold more than Jack Johnson. As the acoustic crooner who put De La Guerra Dining Commons on the map in the song “Bubble Toes,” — although the actual Jack and Kim meeting place was Ortega, DLG just rhymed better — Johnson is a seminal embodiment of this grand school we call home.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Seriously, when thinking of UCSB, it’s all green living, fit bodies, a lively music scene and 5 a.m. sessions at Sands. Jack surfs the swell, croons, keeps in shape and is so environmentally conscious that disposable cutlery is banned from his tours. There’s not one Gaucho who epitomizes Santa Barbara’s quintessential attributes better.</p>\n<p>But there is one thing that keeps Jack away from the classification of the average Gaucho: He’s not a hit-it-and-quit-it kind of guy. It’s no secret that the voraciously social scene of UCSB creates a hookup culture where one night stands are the norm. In this carnal college town, a steady, stable relationship is nearly unheard of. A relationship in I.V. is almost as fabled as Jim Morrison’s time spent here in the ’60s when he wrote “Crystal Ship” after Platform Holly.</p>\n<p>And then Jack and Kim Johnson show up for Alumni Weekend, and the two expel such extensive bouts of cuteness that people believe in true love again. The pair returned to Santa Barbara to receive the UCSB Distinguished Alumni Award for their sustainability and green initiatives within the Hawaiian education system and the music industry. The award fit suitably with UCSB’s newest accolade as the greenest public university in America.</p>\n<p>In their trip to campus, the Johnsons planted citrus trees at Storke plaza, hung out with Chancellor Yang and his wife, Dilling, and stopped by some of their old stomping grounds in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We went to I.V. today and saw our niece’s apartment, which happens to be our friend’s apartment 15, 20 years ago,” Kim said. “I.V. hasn’t changed that much. I think it’s the same carpet.”</p>\n<p>As part of the event, Jack and Kim showed a documentary of their green initiatives with the All At Once campaign, a tour that combined concerts with plastic-free, local food education. The documentary was followed by a Q&amp;A that dished out details from the couple’s way too adorable college lives.</p>\n<p>The song “Do You Remember” chronicles snippets of the young love, mentioning a house with a big piano, a treehouse built on campus that burned down and a bike getting locked to another.</p>\n<p>“He really did lock his bike to my bike, outside of I.V. Theater,” Kim said. “We had already met in the dining commons but we didn’t really see each other after that. So I walked out of my class a week later, and someone locked their bike to my bike and I thought ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t go to lunch right now.’”</p>\n<p>But the story gets better than that. “He [was] hiding in the bushes. He likes to think he’s off to the side being super cool, smoking a cigarette, but really he was hiding. Then he said, ‘Hey, wanna go get lunch?’” Kim said, grinning.</p>\n<p>Following their freshmen year, Jack and Kim ended up living across the street from each other at the end of Sueno, and again on the 66 block of Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>“Then we moved to Trigo — we had a little space with a garden, and that was the first space we gardened,” Jack said.</p>\n<p>Growing up, Jack was only able to sing in front of his mom due to a nervous restrictor he had. Soon enough, he was able to sing in front of Kim, who showed him records by Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin and the Pixies.</p>\n<p>“Kim had already read all of Jack Kerouac and the Beatnik stuff, and I was just getting into that,” the 39-year-old singer said. “She had better taste than me … She’s always been my co-writer [for songs], except the love songs. I don’t let her see those until they’re done.” According to Kim, most of the love songs are written on a whim when Jack forgets a birthday or an anniversary. “Angel” was written one Christmas.</p>\n<p>While dating his college sweetheart and pursuing his film and media studies degree — Jack was keen to make surf documentaries — the soon-to-be professional singer had a DP party band called Soil which formed out of the Anacapa Residence Hall. Soil’s rival band was Django Reinhardt, a group formed by pianist Zach Gill who now plays in Johnson’s band. The two bands would fight it out to get more people to come to their shows, whether it was at a house party or at the Hub.</p>\n<p>“If we heard Django was playing a house party the same night we did, we had to get another keg. So we’d always have two kegs,” Jack said.</p>\n<p>Post-college, Kim got her master’s in teaching at UCSB and started at Dos Pueblos High School. Jack did video production gigs, made surf movies and shot music videos for the Foo Fighters and Limp Bizkit. He wrote the soundtrack to the surf cult hit “Thicker Than Water.” This was the big break in his singing-songwriting career and caused Ben Harper to invite Jack to perform alongside him in 2001. That same year, the Hawaiian native released his first album, <em>Brushfire Fairytales</em>, which went platinum in the States and reached number one in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>But a year before Jack blew up on the radio, his best day ever was spent getting married to his college sweetheart, barefoot and on the beach.</p>\n<p>Upon receiving the Distinguished Alumni Award, Jack repeated how wonderful it was to get an award as a couple.</p>\n<p>“To me this is the biggest honor, that they recognize us both … then I look back at our tours and I see the evolution, where we got to while working with non-profit groups, I’m really proud of where we’ve gotten.

Winters delivered this one-liner during UCSB’s sixth annual Talent Trade, which took place March 7-8. The two-day conference featured talent industry professionals who discussed where they have been and how they got there. From learning how to brand oneself to finding the right agency, a wealth of knowledge filtered through a room on the fourth floor of the SSMS building.</p>\n<p>Like Winters, most of the panelists were former Gauchos. According to Talent Trade’s organizer Danielle Hakimi, alumni were the contacts who confirmed the quickest interest.</p>\n<p>“There’s a certain pride that comes with it — [Alums think] ‘I’m graduated, and now I’m successful,’” Hakimi said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Hakimi directs the purposely lower-cased “mab productions,” an organization which produces events and shows with the hopes of bridging UCSB’s film and theater departments. A third-year theater major, Hakimi is optimistic about mab’s role as a liaison.</p>\n<p>“[The theater department] has actors, designers, directors, people interested in writing and producing. People in the film department make films, look for actors, look for all these people who are five minutes away from them,” Hakimi said.</p>\n<p>Mab productions inherited the Talent Trade conference this year and made it a primary goal to meld together people from both departments. The final group was small — around 25 members — but the smallness allowed students to deeply connect with panelists. Casual networking occurred throughout the weekend, creating what Hakimi calls “a genuine connection.”</p>\n<p>While each session brought its own share of guidance, the agents’ workshop offered tons of practical advice. Here’s a choice selection of tips given by former-gauchos-turned-agents Sarah Agronow, Jackson Gibbon and Winters.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Becoming an actor: Get on Vine and YouTube. Tom Spriggs, a talent manager/producer who was also on the Talent Trade roster, scans YouTube on a daily basis for talent. The main draw is that successful videos already have a following and are marketable to a concrete number. Scrolling through YouTube led Spriggs to finding “Bath Boys,” a comedy group who has since then started doing movies.</li>\n<li>Moving to L.A.: Pick an apartment in Hollywood, Silver Lake or Culver City so you do not have to meander too far from the scene. Three months is the quickest anyone gets a real job, so be prepared for the starving artist life and eating Top Ramen every night.</li>\n<li>Making rent money: Work as a extra in a film or TV show for around $80 a day, or serve in a clap audience for TV sitcoms. Winters was an excellent clapper.</li>\n<li>Finding an agent: Get the phone number of your mom’s best friend’s nephew who has a friend with a brother who works for an agency. Contact them and offer to buy them coffee. Whatever you do, do not solicit at agency front desks and hand random people your headshots. Agronow works at a boutique agency that serves Danny Trejo (“Machete”) and throws lots of headshots away. Occasionally, she will save the funny ones — like man with Chet Faker facial hair and bowtie — to show at seminars like Talent Trade.</li>\n<li>Making an agent like you: Befriend their assistant, because they have all the power. As an agent assistant, Winters handpicked everyone his boss looked at. To get through the first line of defense, buy the assistant coffee and be extraordinarily courteous on the phone.</li>\n<li>Getting a job: Realize that cherry picking is a thing, and figure out your brand, aka that special thing that makes you marketable. Winters told a story about how the man who wrote “The Pirates of the Caribbean” branded himself as “the pirate guy” for several years before the multi-billion-dollar franchise got picked up.</li>\n<li>Getting another job: Gibbon recommended being easy to work with at your first job so that producers will recommend you for another gig. This means coming in on time, knowing your lines and avoiding on-set substance abuse. Apparently Tom Sizemore (“Black Hawk Down”) brought prostitutes to the set and would be engulfed with baking soda in the bathroom for hours. Don’t be that actor.</li>\n<li>Writing a screenplay: Carry a notebook, always. Winters advised to outline ideas fully until you nail the plotline and have an ending.</li>\n<li>Hating L.A. traffic: The general consensus was that L.A. traffic is terrible and will always be terrible, so find podcasts that you love and form a relationship with your car. Winters is always the only one laughing hysterically on the 405 while everyone else sulks into boredom and anger.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since it was an agents’ panel, advice on how to become Ari Gold from “Entourage” was included in the discussion. The main thing to know is that it is a holistically strenuous job. Winters reported that a lead agent at Innovative smashed cell phones with a hammer, while Gibbon ensured that angry spats are “99 percent about them, not about you.”</p>\n<p>The alphabet soup of top agencies to work for was poured out: CAA, UTA and WME. Creative Artists Agency (CAA) is the most prestigious of them all and has weird agent rules like no cell phone use when you’re a freshman. (Hence hammer-smashing). United Talent Agency (UTA) specializes in hot, new talent so they are a solid base for newbie actors. William Morris Endeavor (WME) is the largest agency in the world and supports giants like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington.</p>\n<p>Despite the large amount of celebrity name-dropping that occurred throughout Talent Trade, the conference was largely a casual experience. Panelists talked to attendees without PowerPoint or rehearsed dialogue. Attendees left dry-cleaned slacks at home and wore faded jeans and hooded sweatshirts. Sandwich lunches complete with juice and granola bars were shared amongst everyone. The air of informality was crisp and non-threatening.</p>\n<p>And yet, the informality made the conference all the better. Things didn’t get overcomplicated with resumes or dress code, and the casual attitude everyone held brought genuine connections throughout the weekend. The workshops were a bit ragtag at times, but all in all everyone walked out armed with ideas on how to join the Talent Industry after college.</p>\n<p>In addition to Talent Trade, the Film and Media Dept. has a large repertoire of events such as Word Farm, Reel Loud, Cam Con and the Digital Film Festival.

It’s the place where Beyonce graced her baby sis’s show, the Pixies played their first set in 11 years and Daft Punk constructed an L.E.D. pyramid that instituted them as the grandfathers of dance music. But if there’s one thing that defines Coachella as one of the greatest festivals of this world, it’s this: the Polo campgrounds.</p>\n<p>Now, for those who have never camped before, we know what you are thinking. Camping is for dirty, mud-smeared hippies. Sleeping on a cramped plot of land is not ideal. The shower lines are terrible. And why would we subject ourselves to three days of porta-potty usage. Airbnb and hotels offer clean, quiet rooms for our weary selves, and camping sounds … gross.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, not everyone who camps reeks of unbathed bodies and baggy eyes. In fact, campers have discovered the secret gold nuggets of Coachella: Showers are line-free at nighttime, campsites allow for meal prep which cuts down on food costs and home bases close to the welcome gate provide the luxury of changing clothes and taking a nap before Florence and the Machine. Not to mention, you get so much more than hotel-goers — morning yoga workshops, silent disco ragers, Slip’N Slide rides, a chance to win VIP tickets for life if your car looks psychedelic and says “Carpoolchella,” the list goes on and on.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Whether you’re a newbie camper or an old-timer, here’s the surefire packing list. Don’t be a derp and forget any of the bare necessities.</p>\n<p>Bare Necessities</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wristband + camping pass: It’s obvious, but don’t forget this. A friend did one time, and it caused bad Coachella juju for the whole weekend. His tent uprooted during the Red Hot Chili Pepper dust storm and flew into the juice shack.</li>\n<li>Tent: your secure dwelling, as long as you have stakes to keep it steady during unsuspecting dust storms.</li>\n<li>Sleeping bag, pillow, sleeping mat: You only get six hours of sleep, max, so get as comfy as possible.</li>\n<li>Lawn chairs: No campsite is complete without lounge stations.</li>\n<li>Easy-up, tarp, stakes, hammer: The first two will provide shade, which you will crave. The second two will keep the shade in check.</li>\n<li>Camping stove, pan, pot: If you camp in a big group, it’s worth it to bring cooking supplies and take turns making meals. You’ll save so much money eating potluck tacos, margaritas, chili and pasta.</li>\n<li>Trash bags: to keep things nice and tidy.</li>\n<li>First aid kit: for when shit hits the fan and you get stepped on and start bleeding during the stomp dancing madness of Alabama Shakes and become so grateful for Band-Aids you could cry.</li>\n<li>A sweatshirt: While daytime temperatures reach over 100 degrees, this is still a desert, so it does get cold at night. We know you’ve been carefully selecting your crop tops for weeks, but don’t forget a hoodie.</li>\n<li>Extra set of car keys: just in case the first set gets locked in the car. You don’t want to be that person on Monday morning’s rush to get home.</li>\n<li>Duct tape: The quick fix to anything, duct tape is here for ripped tents and torn tarps.</li>\n<li>Extra batteries: because you never know when batteries can come in handy.</li>\n<li>Hand sanitizer: The nastiness of Coachella porta-potties is not a myth. Defend yourself and get one of those Purells with a clip from Kmart.</li>\n<li>Aspirin, Emergen-C, Pedialyte, antihistamines: At some point, your immune system will start to break down due to extreme heat and extreme dancing, so ease the pain and prep the meds.</li>\n<li>Chapstick: Burt’s Bees is a MUST. The cool, minty flavor will alleviate thirsty lips.</li>\n<li>Flashlight: We know you usually use your phone as a flashlight, but phones die an early death at Coachella. Keeping a flashlight around the campsite is handy for finding toilets in the middle of the night.</li>\n<li>Baby wipes: to de-dust your face and hands before hitting the pillow.</li>\n<li>Clorox wipes: for cleaning around the camp.</li>\n<li>Saline nose solution: If you’ve got bad allergies, this is a necessity. De-gunk your nose nightly to prevent nasal problems. Dirt chunks will fly out, we promise.</li>\n<li>Sunscreen: Your mom will tell you to pack it, and you shouldn’t take this is an opportunity to be rebellious. You will peel. It will get ugly.</li>\n<li>Sunglasses: to protect yourself. Also, ladies, your makeup will slide off your face by 3 p.m. so sunglasses keep you looking fresh.</li>\n<li>Hat: see above.</li>\n<li>Lighter: Useful for many things, a couple of Bics in your pocket will help you make friends throughout the weekend.</li>\n<li>Water canteen: Water bottles cost $2, but fill-up stations are free. The Dollar Tree sells plastic canteens with a carabiner that you can attach to your shorts.</li>\n<li>Ear plugs: Bring these babies along just in case your neighbors are of the wild variety.</li>\n<li>Tissue packets: Little packets of tissues stuffed in your backpack will be a godsend when the porta-potties fail to provide the paper.</li>\n<li>Toilet paper: Leave three rolls in the campground, because Charmin Ultra gets luxurious.</li>\n<li>External battery packs for phone: For $10 you can avoid the charging stations and charge your phone three to four times.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Food and Drink</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Plastic eating utensils, cups, napkins, paper plates, paper towels: Keep it all disposable.</li>\n<li>Ice chest, ice: for obvious reasons.</li>\n<li>Water: You will need LOTS of water. Go to Costco and grab four gallons.</li>\n<li>Beer: No glass is allowed at Coachella, but cans are a go. Good for beer pong, icing injuries, etc.</li>\n<li>Gatorade, Naked Juice, Coconut Water, Bloody Marys: something to restore lost electrolytes and drink in the morning.</li>\n<li>Beef jerky, trail mix, chips, salsa, granola bars: salty snacks with a bit of nutrition to replace what you’ll sweat out throughout the day.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Staying Hygienic</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Toothbrush, toothpaste, breath mints: Keep the mouth fresh for your random makeouts in the air-conditioned Yuma fortress.</li>\n<li>Soap, shampoo, razor, hairbrush, sandals for the shower: The showers are teeny tiny with laughable shelf space so we recommend putting all these in a mesh bag that you can hold around your wrist as your do your thing.</li>\n<li>Deodorant: because body odor can be repelling.</li>\n<li>Towel, bathing suit: Wearing your bathers while showering is recommended, FYI.</li>\n<li>Hair ties: to keep the long locks and man buns secure.</li>\n<li>Bandana: for protecting your oral cavities from nighttime dust storms, keeping your hair out of your face, whatever.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Fun Stuff to Enhance Life</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Camera: DSLRs are not allowed inside the festival, so bring a GoPro or another small-ish device.</li>\n<li>Flag: This will distinguish your campsite from everyone else’s, making it easy to find. Plus it will look sick.</li>\n<li>Car paint: Painting “Carpoolchella” and desert oasis scenes will put you in competition for winning VIP tickets to the festival for life. Get your paints at the Dollar Tree.</li>\n<li>Portable speakers: for morning parties before the music starts at 1 p.m.</li>\n<li>Ping-pong balls, foldable table: We recommend setting up beer pong as early as possible, because the morning heat will force everyone out of tents by 7 a.m. anyway.</li>\n<li>Cards: for breakfast drinking games.</li>\n<li>Glowsticks: because they cost a dollar and will make your nighttime dancing sessions merrier.</li>\n<li>Walkie talkies: Phones don’t work inside the festival campgrounds, so some people bring these. It’s not a necessity, but it’ll get the job done. Plus you can meet similarly kooky people doing the same thing on different channels.</li>\n<li>Head massager: one of those wiry ones that looks like an egg-beater. Having one of these goodies and offering up services will make your friends love you more than they ever did before mid-Caribou’s set.</li>\n<li>Portable fan necklace: Yeah, it’ll look dorky, but keeping this around your neck will cool you and everyone around you when you’re not at the Do Lab getting sprayed by some dude who looks like he’s in LMFAO.</li>\n<li>Group prop: It’s impossible to meet up with people at Coachella. So if you’re the wandering type, it might be good to invest in a group prop so that you can spot friends in the crowd. The group prop can be balloons, giant flag erections or a 6’7’’ friend of yours.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Have fun, coachillers! The happiest place on earth is less than two weeks away.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61955\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coachella-Camping-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"322283324\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61985\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61955\" data-attachment-id=\"61955\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/camping-at-coachella-a-packing-list/coachella-camping-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coachella-Camping-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1397847252\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"110\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Coachella Camping-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coachella-Camping-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coachella-Camping-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-61955\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coachella-Camping-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coachella-Camping-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coachella-Camping-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-61955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61985\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/camping-at-coachella-a-packing-list/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61985\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/camping-at-coachella-a-packing-list/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/camping-at-coachella-a-packing-list/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/camping-at-coachella-a-packing-list/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/camping-at-coachella-a-packing-list/","id":6976,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[6975,6974,6973],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Casual Gets Cool: Folk Pop Band Wild Child Shines On.

Wilson keeps things casual with minimal eyeliner, bare feet and, of course, the turquoise paint on her cheeks.</p>\n<p>“My whole life, face paint has been my jam,” Wilson said in an interview after the show. “First it was mud, then marker, then Sharpies, then acrylic paint … I did it a long time and it was weird, [especially] in high school.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the Texas native, face paint is almost a way to keep herself in check. “It reminds me to just not give a shit. Because it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if you have dirt smeared on your face or paint. All it’s going to do is weed out the people that care about that kind of stuff, and that’s fine,” Wilson said.</p>\n<p>It certainly did not weed anyone out in the SOhO crowd, who clamored for a bit of colored cheeks during the wildly fun night. Wilson and male lead singer/ukulele expert Alex Beggins kept the performance casual, as if singing amongst a very large group of friends. Wearing a striped shirt and an impressively thick mustache, Beggins had a French-painter thing going on. But then he’d open his mouth with a drawling quip like “I feel good, I feel real good, I feel make love-good,” and any sophisticated preconceptions faded away, replaced with the warm fuzzy feeling of grooving with a silly kid in a playground.</p>\n<p>Indeed, comparing Wild Child to silly kids would not be inappropriate; they made the venue their playground, moving into the crowd to sing a cappella and snapping photos with fans long after the show ended. And calling them “silly” is not to suggest a sense of unprofessionalism, but rather highlight the six-piece band’s endearing, always-joking, always-smiling performance.</p>\n<p>“Even if the show sounds bad, even if the music isn’t good, if the band is smiling, I will watch them play for hours,” Wilson said. “Smiling is contagious. If you’re up there having a good time, even people who don’t know your music will have a good time. That’s our basic show principle.”</p>\n<p>Conducive to their bubbly disposition, Wild Child enjoys pulling people onstage, whether they’re part of the tour or from the audience. Opening acts Desert Noises and Goodnight, Texas flooded the stage more than twice to join the soirée. The bassist from rock band Desert Noises tapped his fingers on Wild Child bassist Chris D’Annunzio’s instrument, while the boys from stomp rock group Goodnight, Texas slow-danced like it was prom. “We’re going to keep doing this family style,” Wilson said onstage halfway through the show. “So stay close.”</p>\n<p>This kind of collective, impromptu performance made the night feel especially warm. Jessica Echavarria, a graduate student at Cal State Fullerton, has been to three Wild Child shows in this last tour, and has been onstage twice. “I absolutely adore Wild Child. They’re just so welcoming,” Echavarria said, her phone lit up with a picture of her and Wilson onstage at the Roxy Theater. “They treat you like you’re a human being; they sit next to you like it’s nothing. Most bands won’t do that. Most bands won’t get offstage and mingle with you.”</p>\n<p>Echavarria’s favorite song by the group is “All The Years.” With lyrics like “I can’t think of a better thing than growing old with you/ You, you know I need you by my side,” the song is a nice sample of the relationship and love themes that run through albums <em>Pillow Talk</em> and <em>The Runaround</em>. Word has it that Wilson and Beggins met each other at a time when both had gotten out of a serious relationship, which caused much of their songwriting to fall under the realm of love.</p>\n<p>When they sang sweet tunes like “Stitches” and “Pillow Talk,” it was easy to think Wilson and Beggins are in love. The two work like magic — Beggins leaned over to kiss Wilson on the cheek, to which she playfully teased “Alexander you’ll give me cooties!” — but a fierce sense of friendship and camaraderie overrode the flirtiness. “I think that they’re in love, but their kind of love doesn’t have to be intimate,” Echavarria said. “There’s something spiritual about music, and their souls come together so nicely. Whether or not they’re together, their songs are so deep that my heart is broken with them.”</p>\n<p>And that’s the magic of a band like Wild Child; their music falls into great depths of emotion, and yet they remain a bundle of fun to watch onstage. It’s the best of both worlds: a tangibly spiritual connection and a rioting good dance time. Topped off with a nice dollop of turquoise paint, of course.</p>\n<p><em>To listen to Wild Child, go to </em>soundcloud.com/wildchildsounds.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/87PZgweY-gY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61537\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/casual-gets-cool-folk-pop-band-wild-child-shines-on-wild-child-graces-soho-with-texas-hospitality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61537\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/casual-gets-cool-folk-pop-band-wild-child-shines-on-wild-child-graces-soho-with-texas-hospitality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/casual-gets-cool-folk-pop-band-wild-child-shines-on-wild-child-graces-soho-with-texas-hospitality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/casual-gets-cool-folk-pop-band-wild-child-shines-on-wild-child-graces-soho-with-texas-hospitality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-03/casual-gets-cool-folk-pop-band-wild-child-shines-on-wild-child-graces-soho-with-texas-hospitality/","id":7759,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[7758,7757,7756],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Documentary Gets Selected for SBIFF: Blue Horizons Students Dive Deep with “Mussel Man”","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MattElvisPrint_Alexis-Lim-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MattElvisPrint_Alexis-Lim-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Out in the open ocean past the Santa Barbara harbor, the mussel man drives a self-designed boat at 4:30 a.m. to the harvest ropes.

Metcalf is the professional face of the group. Responsible for publicity and festival submissions, “she does the talking to people thing,” as Mersel puts it. She’s also the one who got Mersel to apply for the program, and she’s the one who was interested in documentary filmmaking from the get-go.</p>\n<p>“I had an odd inclination into some documentary things, but Blue Horizons solidified that direction,” Metcalf said, her light brown hair tucked behind the ears. “It’s nice to have a channel within the film world.”</p>\n<p>Within the program, the trio worked alongside nine other students in a classroom setting. Three courses were required: one lasting the whole nine weeks, the others lasting six and three. Taught by documentary experts Richard Hutton, Michael Hanrahan and LeeAnne French, the classes were a crash-course in all things environmental science and filmmaking. Guest speakers delivered lectures, and this is how Friedman rolled into the picture.</p>\n<p>“[You knew he was] a cool dude. He was wearing a company t-shirt and his bathing suit, and he was like, look at my Tony Stark drawings of my mussels on the rope,” Mersel said. Just like Ironman, Friedman brought blueprints of his special harvesting techniques to show the class.</p>\n<p>Friedman is the only fisherman in California who uses a mussel fishing technique so sustainable it actually cleans the water. But because very little fishermen have seen this technique in the nation, obtaining permits is difficult, and the difficulty has the potential of wrecking the Mussel Man’s entire livelihood.</p>\n<p>“Organizations are hesitant and want him to do all these studies. So he’s wasting all this money,” Mersel said. The film places Friedman as a character intertwined in a larger issue: the importance of finding sustainable animal protein sources.</p>\n<p>As the film details through its numerous interviews, by 2050 there’s expected to be a massive shortage of animal protein. “We kill animals and put them on trucks — it’s polluting our world,” Metcalf said.</p>\n<p>Within this larger framework, Friedman’s sustainable technique serves as a road map to environmentally-friendly food consumption. And just like that, the trio nailed the conflict and resolution for their narrative story.</p>\n<p>Except it wasn’t that simple. Because of Friedman’s modesty — the man is a literal genius, the only one in California to produce mussels in a clean way, and he’s humble as can be — and because of his reluctance to trash talk permit organizations, the filmmakers had to dive deep to unravel the conflict.</p>\n<p>“We kind of imposed ourselves on his family,” Metcalf said. “Which they were okay with. We definitely spent a lot of time hanging out with them and talking to them and getting him to be comfortable talking to us with the camera. Normal people are not comfortable when you stick a camera in their face.”</p>\n<p>Interviewing turned out to be a lengthy process, and the team shot their last bit of footage three days before the project screened at Pollock Theater. That left less than 72 hours to finish editing.</p>\n<p>Seventeen-hour days are notorious in the world of filmmaking, and students in Blue Horizons are no exception to that rule. For the last 10 days before showtime, most hours were spent in the editing room. “We’d get to the editing room at 9 a.m. and we’d leave at 4 a.m.,” Mersel said, to which Metcalf added. “And then we’d come back in at 8 a.m.”</p>\n<p>But the work paid off, and culminated in an invaluable experience for Metcalf, Mersel, Schmidt, Friedman and the Santa Barbara fishery community. Mersel’s mom, aunt and grandma came to the screening, along with Metcalf’s dad and a whole crew of supportive fishermen.</p>\n<p>Blue Horizons films grow in reputation each year, but “Mussel Man” blew it out of the water. The extended profile documentary was selected for three prestigious film festivals: Santa Barbara International Film Festival, San Francisco Ocean Film Festival and the San Luis Obispo International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing that the documentary was to play at SBIFF, the mussel man responded in a characteristically appropriate way for a man of few words: “Great. I’ll have to bring my pen.”</p>\n<p>To find out more about Blue Horizons, go to <a href=\"http://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/emi/blue-horizons\">carseywolf.ucsb.edu/emi/blue-horizons</a>.

A man who has done genres from salacious comedy to psycho-thriller, he’s scored admiration from co-stars and directors alike in his career, which began in 1968 when he operated “Picture, Picture” for Mister Rogers. But the fact that Keaton is well-loved was perhaps never as overwhelmingly apparent as it was last Saturday, Jan. 31 during his Maltin Modern Master tribute ceremony for his work in “Birdman.” Between Jeff Bridges’ video message, Danny Devito’s surprise entrance and SBIFF Executive Director Roger Durling’s tearful speech, the love was overwhelming.</p>\n<p>It started off with a speech from ­­­film critic Leonard Maltin, who moderated the evening. Instead of the proverbial praising of Keaton for all that he has done, Maltin opted for a flashback. “I remember sitting in the theater in Manhattan on Broadway with my wife in 1982 … and watching a movie called ‘Night Shift,’” he said. “Onto the screen burst this extraordinary comedic performer.”</p>\n<p>Maltin continued by focusing not on the Birdman-Batman dichotomy that so many film critics have fallen for, but instead insisting that “Birdman is just a reaffirmation of Michael Keaton’s enormous talent.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Birdman as a reaffirmation of his talent” was a theme that continued throughout the night, a direct response to all the press Keaton is getting for his absence in Hollywood. “Birdman” stars Keaton as a washed-up actor famous for being a superhero, who attempts to restore his craft through theater. So it’s pretty easy to compare Keaton’s own life to that of his character — actor famous for being a superhero disappears until this movie. Perhaps Keaton’s personal life was part of director Alejandro González Iñárritu’s impetus for placing him as Riggan Thomson.</p>\n<p>More likely though is that Keaton’s reputation as a versatile actor contributed to him getting this role, one that has landed him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, as well as a contender for the Oscar. Whatever the reason, the fact that Keaton is a man of many roles was spelled out time and time again during his tribute at the Arlington.</p>\n<p>“Hi Michael, it’s your old friend Noni … I think this [award is] kind of great because it is for your body of work,” said Winona Ryder, in her video message that kicked off “Beetlejuice” clips. She stood in the snow at Sundance, clearly freezing in a hooded coat as she voiced her excitement for Keaton. “The thing about you is that I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen people cannot decide what their favorite Michael Keaton movie is … because you create such extraordinary characters.”</p>\n<p>Judging from his expressiveness when talking about his career, it seemed like one of Keaton’s favorites to work on was definitely “Beetlejuice.” The actor lit up while talking about Tim Burton. “Tim. He’s unique,” he said, as the crowd laughed. “It’s not a word you can apply to many people … He had this thing, but he couldn’t quite [describe it yet]. He wasn’t there yet.” Keaton mentioned that he almost didn’t do the movie because the visionary eccentric Burton wasn’t describing anything he could understand.</p>\n<p>But a great thing about working with Burton [apart from directors like, say, Tarantino] was that he did not monopolize his directing status, and allowed Keaton to be part of the creative process. “[Tim told me that] maybe [Betelgeuse] lives under rocks — so I got the idea of mold. That’s where the mold came from.”</p>\n<p>In 1989, Keaton got to work with Burton again for “Batman” and he developed the rough voice that the superhero became so iconic for. He was, in fact, the very first Batman that gave Bruce Wayne a different voice in the suit.</p>\n<p>“I’d move from Bruce Wayne to Batman, [and thought] he had to transcend. I worked out this whole bullshit actor-y thing. I thought, ‘I gotta have something that makes me believe I don’t walk out on the street in this big rubbery suit and people think — hey Bruce Wayne is out again.’ So I did the voice. And we just used it. Every time I was Batman I altered my voice.”</p>\n<p>That bullshit actor-y thing became the basis for Keaton’s Birdman voice. “[For “Birdman”], the voice got crazier, with more incarnations of it. And then it grew from that.”</p>\n<p>The voice is just one of the aesthetic elements of “Birdman,” a drums-steered movie where the camera never stops rolling. “It was a risky gig, for all of us. But what are we here for? We are here for a millisecond,” said Keaton. “For me courage is the ultimate. That’s it. You gotta have guts.”</p>\n<p>Michael Keaton’s guts were displayed well and true in “Birdman,” but the thing that made this particular evening so special was the enormous affection showered onto him by colleagues. And no video message, not even Robert Duval or Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s, could top the emotion of SBIFF Artistic Director Roger Durling.</p>\n<p>“In 2001, Michael would show up to a coffee shop in Summerland and order a double nonfat latte from a barista,” he began. “[He’d] show up on Sundays to my little café to talk to me about movies … On the red carpet when you just drove in on your limo, you turned to people and said ‘Where is mi amigo Roger’ and it just so shows who you are,” Durling’s voice started cracking.</p>\n<p>“[You’re] not just one of the greatest actors working today, but you’re full of integrity. You are such a real man, an hombre. I feel crystallized that the 12 years I’ve been working at the film festival, it was all meant for me to be able to honor you tonight. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.”</p>\n<p>Michael Keaton is well-loved. Yes, indeed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60579\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60579\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/emotions-spring-up-during-michael-keatons-tribute/","id":6036,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[6035,6034,6033],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Patti Smith Plays Explosive Show at the Granada Godmother of Punk Rock Sells Out Arts & Lectures Gig","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Patti-Smith_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Patti-Smith_Sam-Aragon-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sitting at the edge of the Granada theater stage, the godmother of punk rock shook her silver hair out before jumping down, landing with a feathery thud into the thin carpet.

A collective gasp came from 272 audience members sitting in the front section who held their breath as she moved past them, dancing and clapping for her band onstage. Humble as ever, she tried to make herself a member of the crowd, giving her beloved guitarist of over 25 years Lenny Kaye time to shine. But it didn’t work. All eyes were on the otherworldly woman roaming through the aisles: Patti Smith.</p>\n<p>Sexy, expressive and constantly in motion, Smith and her band played a 15-song set as part of UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures winter season. Wearing jeans that bagged around the knees and her signature menswear blazer, Smith bent gender roles through her feisty cool girl stage presence. Described by the late rock critic Lester Bangs in 1976 as a “badass who pulls off the feat of being simultaneously idol of women and lust object of men,” the 68-year-old rocker continued to bring the badassery.</p>\n<p>In between verses of “Ain’t It Strange,” she sprayed saliva over her right shoulder, nearly hitting her bassist, Tony Shanahan, standing four feet away. During the heavier songs, Smith prowled around the stage like an animal, letting Kaye’s explosive guitar riffs pulsate throughout her body. At one point there was so much fierce tension onstage between singer and guitarist that a fire seemed to erupt from their knees, as they kept bending back and forth towards each other in a frenzy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>At other times, Smith displayed a feminine flirtiness. During “Pumping (My Heart),” she climbed towards the drum kit, playfully waving her body in front of drummer of 40 years Jay Dee Daugherty. Her dancing ranged from the feistiness of an angsty teenage boy to the slow, fleshy movements of a woman seducing her lover. “She danced as if she was a 50s back up dancer with an up-do and a miniskirt, and it honestly made me want to take my clothes off,” said fourth-year English major Natalie O’Brien, who paused a second before adding, “I think I’m in love with a woman.”</p>\n<p>While she undoubtedly had enormous sex appeal, Smith also exuded a mother-like warmth throughout the venue. Gracious and humble, she never tried to out-do her band. Instead, she showed support and love, visibly encouraging them to jam harder and slipping into the audience and the side of the stage to observe the whole scene.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t just the band that felt the warmth; the whole of Granada felt the golden honey cover their bodies and melt away the stresses of tomorrow. Her love for her fans was evident when she trotted through the aisles, holding hands of people who reached for her and receiving hugs and kisses with a smile.</p>\n<p>Linda Benet, a faculty member of SBCC, saw Smith at festivals in the mid-70s, but Tuesday’s show was the first time she saw the rocker perform on a solo bill. “Patti is someone many, many of us seem to trust to take into our psyches perhaps ’cause of her honesty and rawness combined with love,” Benet said.</p>\n<p>This idea of trust resonates especially with those who work closely with Smith. “Her love goes to all people, all people around the world [who] she helps. Patti never had enough food when she was growing up, she never had a toy … she slept in streets. These experiences made her warm,” said Yuki Burns, Smith’s personal assistant, in a conversation after the show. A peppy Japanese lady, Burns has worked with Smith for over 15 years, and handed out prized set lists in Smith’s handwriting to anyone who wanted it.</p>\n<p>Another thing about the lady rocker is that she’s got no shortage of wit. During an improvised rendition of “My Blakean Year,” she stopped the poetry on a line about Ethel Barrymore to rant about John Barrymore being a black sheep and how humans give pigs a bad name. A natural performer, she maintained a lively conversation with the audience throughout the entire show. “Wing!” a man in row Y shouted, referencing a song from <em>Gone Again</em>. “Oh we’re not doing that one,” she answered, but then went into a cappella on the chorus. It was rough around the edges, but her spirit was there and claps ensued afterward. “Sang a little flat, but it was for him, so,” she winked towards the back row.</p>\n<p>Songs were sung in memory of Amy Winehouse, Monty Brown and Fred “Sonic” Smith, the last of whom is her late husband. “I wrote the words of this song for my boyfriend in 1978 … He became my husband, the father of my children and though he is departed, we think of him always. When I sing the words of this song, it is as if it were the first time,” she said, slowing her voice to annunciate “first” and “time” as separate units. “Because the Night” followed this sweet introduction.</p>\n<p>A second tender moment came when she told the story of how The Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun” was the first song she hit all the notes to when she was 16. “Eric Burdon and the Animals … were for us, they were for the disenfranchised, the mavericks, the black sheep, maybe they were for John Barrymore. I say this because tonight we all got to meet Eric and I didn’t get to express this little story to him … I am singing today because I hit all the notes.”</p>\n<p>But the best part of the night came when Smith began the poetry of “Gandhi.” Pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose and reading off two sheets of paper stapled together, she started off slow, so slow one could’ve been lulled to sleep.</p>\n<p>Then came the thunder, the firepower that gets unleashed when Smith gets in the groove. Over the course of eight minutes, she threw the paper down, shoved her glasses into the blazer, spat over her shoulder three times and knocked over the mic stand twice.

It’s a delicate topic. Is this a party school, or is this a world-class research university? The answer usually gets tied down in the celebrated Gaucho motto, “Work hard, play hard.”</p>\n<p>But what this four letter chant fails to observe is the enormous artistic community that is alive on campus and in our quaint seatown Isla Vista. I.V.’s special aura of friendliness and creativity allows things like Bean Night, the Catalyst Literary Arts Magazine and beach drum circles to exist. The magic of being a student at UCSB is that the wise are able to benefit from three interlocking environments: red-cup atmosphere, reputable research and a music scene that never stops playing.</p>\n<p>Enter Sarah LaForge, a UCSB alumnae from 2011. Inspired by her father’s career as a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapist, LaForge went straight to the Psych Info table when she came for Spring Insight in 2007. As a senior, she landed a research assistant position in the Psych Department.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Sarah was great to work with . . . a bright, inquisitive research assistant. I always looked forward to working with her,” said Kim Hartson, a graduate student advised by Psychology Professor David Sherman. “Sarah conducted a number of studies with me, including her URCA project looking at whether listening to heart sounds reduced physiological stress and improved performance.”</p>\n<p>Like a true Gaucho, being an R.A. wasn’t LaForge’s only extra-curricular activity. The UCSB alumnae’s senior year was a mix of being president of Manley Co-op, working on a senior’s thesis and playing music, among other things. “Music became a hobby my senior year at UC Santa Barbara,” said LaForge. “Through the drum circles on the beach [and] the noon Storke shows, there’s such a good music community in Isla Vista. It became a side project along with all this work I was doing to graduate.”</p>\n<p>Upon graduation in 2011, LaForge headed straight into the career world, going into social work for disabled and autistic children in Riverside, California. “It was overwhelming . . . it was so hard on me emotionally that I felt like I had no outlet at the end of the day. I was so worried all the time about these kids,” she said.</p>\n<p>Facilitating her hobby found at UCSB, LaForge ended her social work term and moved to L.A. to write music. Taking on the stage name of “Lucy,” she formed “Lucy &amp; La Mer” in 2012 as a solo act. Other musicians have been added into the mix in the last couple of years, including Grammy-nominated drummer Matt Cook and bassist Jon Lee Keenan. Lucy &amp; La Mer has played in 10 countries throughout Europe and recently just finished a San Diego to Seattle tour with Australian musician Dolly Denko.</p>\n<p>Throughout it all, she’s kept in contact with her mentors at UCSB, and even played at Hartson’s wedding. “I remember my fiancé at the time and I were talking about potentially having a band play at our wedding and Sarah had just posted a new song on Facebook so I sent him a link to her music and he liked it,” said Hartson.</p>\n<p>“It just so happened that Sarah was playing a show in L.A. that weekend so we drove down to see what she was like live and we loved it. I remember asking her at the end of the set to play our wedding and she was excited to do so and we were thrilled. It was really lovely to have such a personal connection to the band playing the wedding. It wasn’t just hiring some random band and we knew we could count on her to really make the wedding special and she did.”</p>\n<p>Besides performing at weddings for good friends, LaForge funds her traveling adventures by hosting amateur music lessons for small children. “In L.A. there’s a lot of parents who want their toddlers taught what music is. I bring fun percussionist instruments, teach them a few chords, and say, ‘hey let’s write a song together.’” She also recently landed a spot as backup singer for 49-year old EDM legend Moby.</p>\n<p>While her life is very different from the days at UCSB testing heart sounds, LaForge hasn’t lost the affinity for study she gained in her degree. In an interview with UCSB’s psych department newsletter, she said, “There’s a surprising amount of research within the music business. Finding your audience is just like finding your sample group – age, location, interest, disinterests, are all important when creating marketing strategies. You’re always hypothesizing about how your group will react and asking questions as you plan.”</p>\n<p>LaForge’s future plans involve combining her UCSB Psychology degree with her passion and training to become a music therapist. But for now, she’s enjoying the hectic lifestyle as a freelance teacher and musician-on-the-road.</p>\n<p>“After you stop school, you’re looking for something [to do]. I don’t have a test Friday, so what am I looking towards, what do I wanna work on. Music became that,” said LaForge. “You never feel balanced, necessarily. But you feel thriving. You’re doing a million things at once, you’re juggling. It’s not as structured as being in school or having a 9-5 job. But I love it.”</p>\n<p>Thriving is the optimum word to describe Sarah LaForge; a UCSB student whose top-notch education and unique environment cultivated her into a singer-songwriter with a research-savvy edge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>To get into contact with Sarah LaForge, go to</em> facebook.com/lucyandlamer</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Just Friends (Single) by Lucy &amp; La Mer\"

fleeting, but at least we have this,” said KCSB general manager Yibing Guo, her hands gripping the cardboard cd case with “KCSB 91.9 Live in Studio A” stamped on it in green ink. <em>Live in Studio A</em> is KCSB’s first compilation cd, featuring 19 tracks by artists varying from indie rock to Brazilian jazz to DJ sampling.</p>\n<p>Measuring at a mere 17 by 9 ½ feet, the hexagonal Studio A has been visited by droves of musicians in the last fifty years, including jazz pianist Mose Allison, the late virtuosic trumpeter Don Cherry, and, more recently, DJ and rapper Madlib. The compilation stretches only as far as the last 12 months, but its 19 featured artists represent a sizable snapshot of what grooves the little studio under Storke Tower.</p>\n<p>The project was spearheaded by Guo, who has always dreamt of doing a compilation album to document the going ons of KCSB. Although the streaks of blue in her hair create the effect of a blissed-out mermaid, Guo is a powerhouse when it comes to getting stuff done. She spent the better part of the last four months contacting the musicians and okay-ing their contribution to the CD, a job that took an absurd amount of back and forth emailing and persuasion.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>During her role as program director last year, Guo formed a dynamic duo with fellow program director Bennett Piscitelli and the two created a show in the Friday noon spot, “Future Daze.” The goal of the show was to present the new music that KCSB constantly comes into contact with. “It’s always like Christmas at KCSB – we are always getting new CDs and vinyl,” said Guo.</p>\n<p>Through “Future Daze,” Guo and Piscitelli were able to showcase new music that they found on CDs mailed to the KCSB office. “We’d play CDs that we liked, review them and talk about them. We also contacted people through promoters – we had so many live bands coming through for that show,” she said.</p>\n<p>Some of these live performers included New Zealander indie rock group Streets of Laredo, L.A. funk masters Evolfo, and most notably, Brazilian singer-songwriter Rodrigo Amarante. Each of these musicians secured a spot onto the compilation.</p>\n<p>“Bennett [Piscitelli] and I met Streets of Laredo at a venue in lower east side New York. We walked down these steps to this huge showcase of New Zealand talent. One of the members of the band – this tall guy with a big beard – was handing out CDs so we took one and got his card,” said Guo. “That night I popped the CD into my laptop,” and the blue-haired lady loved them.</p>\n<p>Later, the dynamic duo got in contact with the group back in Santa Barbara, and few a months later the kiwi band came to the West Coast for the first time and played in Studio A. There were seven of them with keys, guitars and various other instruments, and the small space of the studio bled with intimacy throughout the set.</p>\n<p>Streets of Laredo’s bit marks the second track on the album. “Hey Rose” is a gorgeous indie rock tune following similar undertones of the Lumineers and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. The harmonies meld wonderfully while the tambourine lends a nice shakeup towards the end of the track.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/zMwCmio2jCUframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zMwCmio2jCU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>Evolfo was another of Guo’s favorites. “The lead singer of the band was really good friends with the general manager from three years ago, the general manager when I first got involved in KCSB,” Guo said. “One day he sent me a message on Facebook that Evolfo was gonna be in the area and he sent me a YouTube video. It was great! So we set it up the next day.”</p>\n<p>But live sessions don’t usually get set up that quick. One artist in particular, Rodrigo Amarante, was on Guo’s radar for months before she braved sending emails to his publicist. “I’ve liked his music since freshmen year of high school, when I first since I heard Little Joy, one of his projects with Fabrizio Moretti from The Strokes. I was just like, wow this guy has such a wonderful voice,” she said.</p>\n<p>Piscitelli, whom Guo affectionately refers to as the “more chill one” in their partnership, urged her to contact Amarante’s people all year. She finally rid herself of inhibitions and sent the email. A couple weeks later, Rodrigo Amarante showed up at Studio A.</p>\n<p>“He called me on my phone, saying he was in the parking lot and coming to KCSB, and I couldn’t even believe it,” said Guo.</p>\n<p>The meeting with Amarante happened mid-July, and it was an especially beautiful performance because it was the first gig that Guo and Piscitelli worked on together since the latter’s graduation in June.</p>\n<p>“Rodrigo Amarante – that was really something,” Guo said, annunciating the “che” sound in the famed singer’s last name. “It was mine and Bennett’s [Piscitelli] comeback to the airwaves.” It was their last time on “Future Daze.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/4i7NB51rPkYframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/4i7NB51rPkY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p>Nowadays, “Future Daze” is manned by the current program directors, and between that show and SBDIY founder Josh Redman’s “5…4…3…2…fun!!” program, loads of musicians are rolling into Studio A. <em>Live in Studio A</em> is a testament to the great tunes and closeness that forms within the cramped hexagonal walls.</p>\n<p>“Listening to the CD, so many feelings come back,” said Guo. “They were playing and I was standing in the middle, the middle of the band. I was doing this three sixty [camera] shot and they were all standing around me. It was just – awesome. You’re in this music landscape, but it’s a different kind of dimension that you’re involved in.”</p>\n<p>That different kind of dimension is the beauty of Studio A.<em> </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Live in Studio A is being released as a present for donors of KCSB’S Fund Drive, happening until Friday, Nov. 21.

Its lyrics are as such: “You got that special kind of sadness/You got that tragic set of charms/That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles/Makes me wanna wrap you in my arms.” Wrap you in my arms? No wonder the lady gushed so hard.</p>\n<p>Taylor wasn’t the only Goldsmith who had the audience grinning in satisfaction. Behind him, his curly-haired brother Griffin rocked the drum set and sang harmonies to meld with Taylor’s folksong voice. Bassist Wylie Gelber later noted in an interview on the SOhO patio that “Griff might be a better singer,” to which Griffin stated, “But Taylor is THE showman, you gotta be ballsy to do what he does.”</p>\n<p>Griffin was presumably referring to Taylor’s insane guitar riffs. When Taylor ignores the microphone and focuses on the guitar, he goes into a trance. His eyes glaze ever, his teeth chew on his top lip and his body moves erotically, a motion that translates to the insane finger-plucking. He invited up a good pal who looked like a regular cowboy onstage to riff on “From a Window Seat,” from their latest album <em>Stories Don’t End</em>. The cowboy wore a toothy smile and a sense of control which contrasted Taylor’s glazed-over, out-of-this-world musicality.</p>\n<p>Also on set was keyboard extraordinaire Tay Strathairn, who got picked up by the Goldsmiths seven years ago. The other three have known each other on a daily basis for more than 10 years, and according to Gelber, they get along really well.</p>\n<p>“We do pretty good. We’re on tour so much that if we didn’t get along great it would be a nightmare. We literally have to spend every single day together. And back when we toured for seven years, it was just us in a van driving around the country.”</p>\n<p>Dawes’ car in those days was a black, 14-passenger van that they put 5,000 miles on. It was a brutal and magical time, with the constant driving through the night to get to the next show. “[We used to] drive from Des Moines to Chicago, and literally pull up to the venue, do a sound check, play and drive [off] to a new place,” said Gelber.</p>\n<p>Now Dawes has gotten beyond the days of switching off midnight drivers, and they’ve got enough clout to employ people. So it’s fun for them to play the small venues they used to with a proper crew to handle all the administrative business.</p>\n<p>“We played this exact place without a crew four years ago. Rolled up and used the guy who worked here to run our sound who never heard of our band,” said Gelber. “Now it’s so much more plush. We have a crew, we have a hotel, everything is dialed in. It’s amazing.”</p>\n<p>Gelber, whose first name Wylie is pronounced like the cartoon coyote that chases after road runner, is a floppy-haired, laid-back guy. He explained that the purpose of the SOhO show and the mini-California tour Dawes embarked on was to practice their new songs, which will be released in a new album later this year.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we are rehearsing in front of everyone … we’ve done it before in a rehearsal room and it start[ed] sounding weird and sterile,” said Gelber. “It’s much easier to figure out what works and what doesn’t when you’re playing at a show … you respond better at a show rather than when it’s the four of you.”</p>\n<p>The idea that this show was a “rehearsal” explains why each band member seemed to be in their own head onstage, figuring out particulars. While Taylor Goldsmith sang with a pick in his mouth and transported to another world on guitar, Wylie Gelber’s tall frame reclined on the speaker, as if playing the bass on a bed at home. Griffin Goldsmith kept the tempo alive on drums, but even he closed his eyes behind wire-frame glasses. Tay Strathairn kept to the keyboards and experimented with groovy Cuban beats.</p>\n<p>The four individuals blended together beautifully, and although the set included many new songs, their loyal fan base swayed in appreciation. “This really means the world to us,” Taylor Goldsmith murmured. “Favorite show of the tour by far.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/UomgPTo88zwframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UomgPTo88zw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A print version of this story appeared in the Daily Nexus on Thursday, Oct. 23.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57566\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57566\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/new-noise-2014-soho-crowd-goes-wild-for-dawes/","id":7635,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[7634,7633,7632],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cherub Headlines New Noise: Drugs, Sex and Indie Pop","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Doses and Mimosas” first infiltrated the speakers of Isla Vista in 2012.

It was easily one of the biggest anthems of the year, along with the overplayed “Feel So Close” and horridly catchy “Call Me Maybe.” For some reason “Doses and Mimosas” never got old for me (can’t say the same about you, Carly Rae Jepsen), and it was super groovy to see the act behind the song live. Last Sunday, Oct. 19, Cherub sparkled as the headliner of the Block Party, the last hurrah of this year’s New Noise Conference and Music Festival.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, I caught up with Josh Ocean of Ghost Beach, who preceded Cherub. Ocean was a generous conversationalist, complimenting the band onstage and pondering musical ideas out loud. He told me he liked my floral headband (made of fabric scraps from a booth at the front of the Block Party), so I gave it to him. He immediately put the purple mangled mess over his bleached blonde hair and gave me an appreciative high five.</p>\n<p>Ocean is the vocals and synth master of Ghost Beach, a Brooklyn-based electro-pop duo. They’ve been on tour with Cherub for the last eight weeks after the two groups met in London. “It’s been so crazy [being with them],” said Ocean. I pressed him for details, to which he took off his robin egg blue shades, widened his eyes and said, “Use your imagination.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Kelly classic “Bump ‘n Grind,” the two men who form electronic pop band Cherub danced their way to the stage, only to become wary of the crappy sound system and shortened time slot. This was around 6:48, and Cherub was the last of six bands to close out the weekend. Unfortunately for the disco pop duo, the venue’s monitors were faulty, and they ran into timing issues for the rest of the show. Thankfully, spirits were running high through the crowd, and Cherub made the best of the unlucky circumstances.</p>\n<p>The duo, which consists of bassist Jordan Kelley and guitarist Jason Huber, were super attentive to the audience, singling out people in the crowd and giving a shout out to an old friend named Matt who they tried all the drugs with back in the day. If there was one thing that Cherub made clear on Sunday, it was that they love their drugs and sex. Of course, anyone who has mildly creeped on their social media would be able to tell you that. According to Facebook, they’ve got a “common goal to share a little bit of sex, a little bit of drugs and a whole lot of love with people across the globe.”</p>\n<p>“I wanna see more clouds,” said Kelley, referencing the marijuana and cigarette fog that floated above the 400 person crowd. Kelley began several anecdotes onstage, only to continue singing under the pressure of time. So he truncated the storytelling with little snippets like, “This song is about casual sex,” and “This song is about doing a lot of cocaine in the bathroom stall.” It was obvious that Kelley wanted to charm the audience more with his potent soliloquies; under the circumstances, he did what he could.</p>\n<p>In an act that demonstrates Cherub’s all-night-long attitude, Kelley cordially invited everyone to an after-party at EOS Lounge, yelling that even though the noise ordinance at the Block Party was at 8 o’clock, “We are going to play music until we all black out.” Drunken college kids cheered, waved their arms back and forth and made out with the stranger next to them.</p>\n<p>Cherub sang new tracks from their latest release <em>Year of the Caprese</em>, including “&lt;3 (Heart),” “Do the Math” and “Disco Shit.” They fed the audience the old stuff — “XOXO” from <em>MoM and DaD</em> and of course the classic champagne showers song that got them so popular in the first place, “Doses and Mimosas.”</p>\n<p>At the end of the show, Kelley and Huber were looking pretty knackered, both sweating profusely with their hair hanging in strings. But their eyes were still ablaze, especially when they did a duo guitar solo together. “Hey,” said Kelley. “You guys are the best — what day is it? — best Sunday crowd we’ve ever had!”</p>\n<p>When the best Sunday crowd Cherub ever had screamed for an encore, Kelley and Huber came back onstage, only to have their mics cut off. If this was any other band, they would have gone back to the hotel, complained about the shortened time slot and knocked out in preparation for more shows in L.A. But this is Cherub, and true to their lyrics, they kept the party going at EOS Lounge; after all, “it’s all overrated/except drugs and alcohol.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57561\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1352025362\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57560\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57561\" data-attachment-id=\"57561\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-29/cherub-headlines-new-noise-drugs-sex-and-indie-pop/cherub-at-new-noise-sb_kenneth-song_for-10-22-2014-2191/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1413745748\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cherub at New Noise SB_Kenneth Song_for 10.22.2014-2191\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-57561\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cherub-at-New-Noise-SB_Kenneth-Song_for-10.22.2014-2191.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57561\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/8h3t2h4NKPYframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/8h3t2h4NKPY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A print version of this story appeared in the Daily Nexus on Thursday, Oct. 23.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Music Festival will infiltrate all of the music venue hotspots in downtown Santa Barbara with a kickass California cool lineup. The festival starts Wednesday, Oct. 15 with The Story So Far playing Velvet Jones, and ends with the annual Block Party on Sunday, Oct. 19. This year the Block Party is bigger and badder (the good kind of bad) than ever, with The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Ghost Beach, Gibbz + Mango Mango and FMLYBND performing. Electro-pop duo Cherub is the last act of the weekend, closing out the Block Party with what I’m sure will be a spirited rendition of “Doses and Mimosas.” With so many bands to see, it’s hard to narrow things down, so here are Artsweek’s picks for top bands to see at New Noise 2014.<br>\nCheers!

Generating a unique sound comparable to the musical genres of indie folk, rock and country, the Kinds create heavenly tunes by combining powerful female vocals, catchy melodies, acoustic rhythms and alternative sounds.</p>\n<p>The ensemble is composed of four members: lead singer/songwriter Khasy Modisette, Nathan Modisette, Anders Bergstrom and Erich Riedl. Husband and wife duo Khasy and Nathan Modisette had played music together for over 20 years before they decided to create a band. The other two members, whom the couple met through the local music scene, were a perfect complement for the duo’s musical taste. While the Kinds are a growing band in terms of popularity, they are well-known throughout Santa Barbara and often perform acoustically at SOhO Restaurant and Music Club.</p>\n<p>Four of their songs can be found on their Reverbnation page, including “Battle Song,” “Been a Long Time,” “Big Red Heart” and “Bus Stop.” While “Battle Song” and “Been a Long Time” include more alternative and electric melodies through the use of drums and upbeat rhythms, “Big Red Heart” and “Bus Stop” reveal the indie folk and country genres of the group as their slower themes strike a more solemn chord.</p>\n<p>The second band, Yellow Red Sparks, is a three-piece collective from Irvine, CA. The trio is made up of songwriter/guitarist Joshua Hanson, upright bass player/vocalist Sara Lynn Nishikawa and drummer/lead singer Darren Goldstein, otherwise known as Goldy. Yellow Red Sparks’ genre is described as indie folk, including elements of new folk, old folk, thematic folk, cinematic folk and alternative genres as well. Yellow Red Sparks started out as Joshua Hanson’s solo project, with Hanson writing his own acoustic tunes and vivid lyrics, and later grew to become the trio it is today.</p>\n<p>The group released their first self-titled album, which intricately reveals their heartfelt and melancholic sound.  Lush harmonies, sentimental melodies and cinematic musical arrangements combine with lyrics filled with honesty and heartache to create a rich folky sound.

The all-ages show is part of the second night of the Santa Barbara New Noise Music Conference &amp; Festival.</p>\n<p>Dawes has been around since 2009 and is made up of brothers Taylor (guitar and vocals) and Griffin Goldsmith (drums), along with Wylie Gelber (bass) and Tay Stratheim (keyboards). In 2010, they made their television debut on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Since then, Dawes has toured with experimental country-folk band Blitzen Trapper and played alongside Jackson Browne at an Occupy Wall Street event in New York City in 2011. Their third album, “Stories Don’t End”, was released April 9, 2013.</p>\n<p>NPR and Rolling Stone have praised Dawes’ vintage sound and distinctly Southern Californian spirit reminiscent of the Eagles. Songs off of Stories Don’t End like “Just Beneath the Surface” and “Just My Luck” reveal their gritty, self-reflective lyrical power combined with a folky yet sophisticated sound.</p>\n<p>If you’re a fan of Wilco, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band or any other contemporary or older folk-rock, this is the concert for you.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F78108721&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true&amp;show_comments=true&amp;color=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Dawes will be performing at SOhO on Thursday, Oct. 16 at 7 p.m. Tickets are $22 and can be purchased at <em>nightout.com/events/dawessb/tickets#.VDX_I_nF-So</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>VELVET JONES: Nick Waterhouse</h4>\n<p><em>Ashley Nguyen</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56783\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56783\" data-attachment-id=\"56783\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-11/new-noise-conference-music-fest-picks/nick-waterhouse/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nick-waterhouse.jpg?fit=800%2C1078&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1078\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"nick waterhouse\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nick-waterhouse.jpg?fit=186%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nick-waterhouse.jpg?fit=760%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56783\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nick-waterhouse-185x250.jpg?resize=300%2C404\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of Nick Waterhouse\" width=\"300\" height=\"404\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-56783\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of Nick Waterhouse</p></div>\n<p>A middle school girlfriend first introduced Nick Waterhouse to the blues. Though Waterhouse’s music today is commonly categorized under rhythm and blues, his music is an eclectic mix of multiple genres. Tapping into the elements of jazz and soul as well as rhythm and blues, Waterhouse creates an upbeat, retro vibe paired with dark lyrics.</p>\n<p>Raised in Huntington Beach, Waterhouse picked up the guitar at 12 years old and began writing music when he was 14. When asked in an interview with Songfacts about his style of music he commented, “Asking me if I write [songs] in a style is sort of like asking a Jamaican person why they talk in the funny way they do.” Waterhouse went on further to explain that establishing his certain style of music was never his intention. Rather, he simply did whatever he thought sounded pleasing and as a result, his product established a style of its own.</p>\n<p>Naming idols such as Van Morrison, Mose Allison and John Lee Hooker, Waterhouse illustrated that by trying to emulate his different idols, he developed his own sound. Rather than being bound by the confines of a specific genre or the mimicry of any one artist, Waterhouse’s music simply sounds like himself. His debut single, “Some Place,” was recorded at the Distillery and released in late 2010. Since then, Waterhouse released his full album Times All Gone, toured and involved himself in collaborations. Other noteworthy singles include “Say I Wanna Know” and “I Can Only Give You Everything” which are comprised of a jazzy, timeless beat that also brings with it a sense of nostalgia.</p>\n<p>Waterhouse is scheduled to perform at Velvet Jones in downtown Santa Barbara on Oct. 17, during the annual New Noise Music Festival. Amidst many other local and upcoming artists, Nick Waterhouse’s old-fashioned, yet still modern music deems his performance one to watch.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F21255109&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true&amp;show_comments=true&amp;color=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n<p>Nick Waterhouse will perform at Velvet Jones on Friday, Oct. 17 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $15 and can be purchased at <em>nightout.com/events/new-noise-fest-nick-waterhouse/tickets#.VDYBbvnF-</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Kennedy airport in New York that would change the course of American pop culture forever. This was, of course, the day that the Beatles first stepped on American soil, greeted by thousands of screaming fans. The bowl-cut-sporting Fab Four, whose song “I Want to Hold Your Hand” had topped American charts only a few weeks prior, were shocked when their pilot announced, “Tell the boys that there’s a big crowd waiting for them.”</p>\n<p>And what a crowd it was – 5,000 screaming girls (and a few men) at the airport. Most of these new fans had heard “I Want To Hold Your Hand” only a week ago, but a lot were enticed by the promise of a free t-shirt and a dollar, a promotion headed by Seltaeb, The Beatles’ U.S merchandising organization. Adding to the buzz was the fact that New York City was covered in bumper stickers and posters, dispersed by Capitol Records, bearing the slogan “The Beatles are Coming”. That Friday morning Beatlemania had officially arrived.</p>\n<p>This weekend, Beatlemania is coming again, this time in the form of a three day festival in Los Angeles. Titled “The Fest,” the Fab Four celebration that has been running since 1974 is taking over the LAX Marriot Hotel.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It promises three days of living and breathing the Beatles, with different parts of the hotel sectioned out for panel discussions, photo galleries, drum symposiums, yoga, workshops, auctions, love marketplaces, special guest signings and more.</p>\n<p>There’s even an ashram “at the end of penny lane” that pays tribute to the Beatles’ 1968 trip to India, where they studied transcendental meditation with the Maharishi.
