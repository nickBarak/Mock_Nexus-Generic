Duly anticipating a show by the legendary Tony Bennett, the crowd stood in long, hot lines only to be told that the Granada Theatre was postponing the show due to a blackout on State Street. </p>\n<p>The lights between Arlington and Anapamu Streets shut off around 6:00 p.m., following a 5:30 p.m. blackout in Montecito. All of the street lights were shut off, and all the restaurants between the streets were unable to serve food. Those who already had fed their customers placed candles on tables.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In front of the Granada, the older crowd stood patiently in their dress clothes, crossing their fingers in hopes that the situation would be fixed so their $60 and up tickets to Tony Bennett would not go to waste.

Lectures, UCSB’s premier event company, has much in store for students, with tickets running a third of the normal adult price for shows like Matt Groening and John Cleese.</a> Then there’s the Santa Barbara Bowl, the 4,562-seat amphitheater which is playing Lorde, Ray LaMontagne, Hall and Oates and Foster the People this fall season. We at Artsweek love the local stuff and these two companies never fail to disappoint. So take your pick with our easy-to-follow event guide.

Famous for posting pictures of acne-prone skin in an attempt to show the lies perpetuated by magazines and their Photoshop skills, Lorde has identified herself as a feminist and was named one of Time’s most influential teenagers in the world. To say that Lorde is talented is an understatement; the woman is THE pop goddess of 2014, fighting the likes of Miley Cyrus in pursuit of becoming a “Pure Heroine,” like her newest album title suggests. Fun facts: she loves peanut M&amp;Ms, is from New Zealand and doesn’t have a driver’s license. That’s why she drives Cadillacs in her dreams. Heh.

His latest album, one of five, has been hailed by NPR as “explosively creative,” boasting a 60s-pop tone. This show is part of LaMontagne’s Supernova Tour, which will take him across Canada and the States. Often compared to Otis Redding and Van Morrison, the 41-year-old bluesy guitarist has a strong reputation to withhold. Artsweek suggests you immediately play “You Are the Best Thing” on Spotify and let LaMontagne’s smooth drawl take you away to clicking on Ticketmaster.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>TIMELESS DYNAMIC DUO:</h4>\n<p>Daryl Hall and John Oates<br>\nWHEN/WHERE: Sunday, Oct. 19, 7 p.m. SB Bowl<br>\nCOST: $45-$90<br>\nWHY YOU SHOULD GET YOUR HOMEWORK DONE EARLY THAT SUNDAY AND GO: Ahem, this is HALL AND OATES we are talking about here, people! Not only are they the number-one selling duo of all time, but their music has transcended the 70s and is still very present today in the new remix culture, with fans like Ben Gibbard, John Mayer and Gym Class Heroes. This is a chance to see a band your parents listened to when they were in college. And anyway, what could be better than taking the 24x bus downtown to catch Hall and Oates sing “You Make My Dreams Come True?” Nothing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>INDIE POP BAND:</h4>\n<p>Foster the People w/ Sylvan Esso and Soko<br>\nWHEN/WHERE: Saturday, Nov. 15, 6:30 p.m. SB Bowl<br>\nCOST: $34.50-$54.50<br>\nWHY YOU SHOULD VACATE ISLA VISTA/THE DORMS THAT SATURDAY AND GO:<br>\nFoster the People is probably most famous for “Pumped Up Kicks,” but there’s more to them than the catchy keyboard beats of that lyrically depressing tune. Fun Fact: according to a Rolling Stone article with lead singer Mark Foster, the intention behind the catchiness of the song was to call out hipsters who would dance to the song without knowing the meaning behind it. (We got you now, hipsters!) The L.A. band, which consists of Foster, bassist Jacob “Cubbie” Fink and drummer Mark Pontius, has put out two albums since forming five years ago. This tour will be in support of the second album, Supermodel, which has received rave reviews.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 13 of Thursday, October 10, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56391\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56391\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/top-picks-for-santa-barbara-bowl-this-fall/","id":7089,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[7088,7087,7086],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"L.A.

It was an interesting choice from her fourteen-song album, <em>Midnight in the Garden</em>, and its melancholy lyrics immediately set the tone for her set. Last Wednesday, SOhO served as an intimate space for the L.A. songstress who left all her vulnerability onstage, along with a bottle of Fiji water and her beard-friendly, week-long guitarist/accompanist, Matt Koziol.</p>\n<p>The night began with a pleasant surprise. I, a lowly reporter, happened to walk into the bathroom at SOhO, only to see singer-songwriter Lily Kershaw coming out of the stall, red hair aflame and head-to-toe in black. “Hi, how are you!” she exclaimed, her genial attitude wrapping me in a blanket of confused warmth since she probably had no clue who I was. “I’m good! I’m so excited to be here, it was great to talk to you last week,” I quipped, upon which her warm brown eyes lit up and she realized I was the reporter she conversed with for an hour whilst packing up for the “Like the Sun” tour she was now embarking on.</p>\n<p>She proceeded to introduce me to her mother, a blonde beauty named Whitney, and her publicist, along with her brand-new guitarist Matt, an East Coaster whom she’d gotten to know pretty well over seven days. She picked him up for the tour since her previous band members had gone on another gig. “It’s going to be so funny in Canada, because we are staying in a house, and Matt will be the first man I’ll ever live with!” Kershaw giggled, to which her publicist retorted, “Well yeah, besides your dad!”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saying that Kershaw is the bubbliest, most down-to-earth artist I’ve ever encountered would be a severe understatement. At 23 years old, Kershaw has had her music featured on “Criminal Minds,” won #5 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart, and has befriended fellow acoustic guru Paul McDonald, so much that the two may very well form a band. And yet, she remains this kind, generous person, humble in every way. I followed her towards the stage once her opener, Taylor Berrett came on, and the two of us listened to him like a couple of fawning teenage girls. “I have never seen him play before,” she whispered. “I like him!”</p>\n<p>Of course, who couldn’t like the lovable Berrett, whose soft folk melodies, baby-faced good looks and charismatic personality thoroughly governed the stage. He showed instrumental chops by switching from guitar to piano midway through the set, to perform “Whole Heart”, off his debut album <em>Anchor Casting</em>. A native to Sterling, Virginia, Berrett embodied a certain wholesome charm with his easy way at the microphone. More than a couple of times he pumped SOhO up for coming acts, saying, “This is mine and Bobby and Lily’s first show together; don’t worry, the acts get progressively better looking after me”. He offered a sincere apology to the ladies when discussing his fellow tour mate, Bobby Bazini, lamenting, “I apologize to any women with boyfriends, your relationship is about to come to a tragic end. I almost broke up with my girlfriend when I saw Bobby play; so it’s really gonna be hard for a lot of relationships. That’s the cost of art I guess.”</p>\n<p>The talented Bobby Bazini took the stage next, dressed down in a black tee with a silver watch adorning his left wrist. Although he hails from Montreal, not a hint of Bazini’s French-Canadian accent was apparent in song. As a singer, he’s raspy and suave; a lot of soul comes out of Bazini, who crooned into the mic with one eye open. He switched guitars several times, and hit a foot drum, all whilst singing in his throaty, masculine way. Most of the tunes came from his sophomore album, <em>Where I Belong</em>.</p>\n<p>When Lily Kershaw took her place onstage, the air grew intense with the singer’s vulnerability. She sang “Better”, followed by “Midnight in the Garden”, her title track. Her hand clutched the microphone forcefully, as if she needed it to hold her steady; her other hand sat in her leather jacket. Kershaw, who never plays guitar in front of people, pulled out an acoustic guitar spontaneously. “This is probably the third time I’ll play in front of an audience, and the first time I’m doing the song with Matt. This is a song called ‘Take Care’ — my grandfather passed away a couple of weeks ago, and I wrote it for him,” she said, her voice cracking.</p>\n<p>As a whole, the performance was achingly stripped; just Kershaw’s voice and the strums of Koziol, who hadn’t learned all of her songs yet. Instead, they did cover songs the two were both familiar with. Couples leaned closer together as a Leonard Cohen number sprang sweetly from Kershaw’s lips, a love song the man had written about Janis Joplin. The choice of whether to play an Elliot Smith or Miranda Lambert tune ensued in a rock-paper-scissor competition between Kershaw and Koziol, to which Elliot won out, and “Between the Bars” was sung.</p>\n<p>After singing “Like the Sun,” the name of her tour, she walked off the stage in a rush, leaving an ambiguity as to whether it was over yet. She returned to a slightly awkward stage to encore with the Miranda Lambert song, which lost rock-paper-scissors. “I like this one, let’s do it,” Koziol coaxed.</p>\n<p>The song, “The House That Built Me,” secretly had Bob Dylan’s “Wagon Wheel” melded into it, and was the perfect ending to what turned out to be a very sentimental show. The L.A. singer turned to Koziol, gave him a professional handshake and left the stage.</p>\n<p>I caught up with Kershaw afterwards, and asked her if it ever gets too emotional onstage. “Yes it does. Every single time.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>To see her upcoming tour dates or get more information about Lily, go to </em><a href=\"http://lilykershaw.com/\"><em>http://lilykershaw.com/</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56121\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-16/la-songstress-lily-kershaw-paints-the-town-black/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56121\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-16/la-songstress-lily-kershaw-paints-the-town-black/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-16/la-songstress-lily-kershaw-paints-the-town-black/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-16/la-songstress-lily-kershaw-paints-the-town-black/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-16/la-songstress-lily-kershaw-paints-the-town-black/","id":7069,"author":{"id":356,"name":"Audrey Bachelder"},"related":[7068,7067,7066],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lily Kershaw to Headline SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A 23-year-old singer-songwriter who has been writing since age 13, Kershaw gained international attention in 2012 when her song “As It Seems” appeared on season seven of “Criminal Minds.” Almo...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><b>The L.A.

Her cathedral arched windows allow just the right amount of light to get her up, prompting her to grab one of the four guitars lying around her collection of vintage 60s furniture. She starts the day nestled into a parrot-patterned loveseat that was her grandparents’ with a cup of Joe to work on a song and figure out what it wants to be. She is, in her words, “a slave to the music.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">A 23-year-old singer-songwriter who has been writing since age 13, Kershaw gained international attention in 2012 when her song “As It Seems” appeared on season seven of “Criminal Minds.” Almost overnight, people around the world were buying the song, and it eventually reached #1 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter Singles Chart. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In 2013, she recorded her debut album, <i>Midnight in the Garden</i>, in just 14 days. It was a fast-paced and intimidating project for the fledgling artist, who had little-to-no experience in the studio. “I literally woke up every night the week prior in a sweat,” remembers Kershaw. “I kept thinking, ‘how am I supposed to do this. How do you make something out of nothing?’ I had these songs and these guitar parts, but I couldn’t imagine bringing them to life.”</span></span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">From that intense process, Kershaw learned to immerse herself into production, be brave and go with her gut. “There wasn’t a lot of time to figure it out and plan,” she explains. “I hadn’t developed that part of my ear yet for what I wanted surrounding songs I had written acoustically. Now that ear is super developed and I hear instrumentation that I want — the guitar, the piano, the banjo.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Following <i>Midnight in the Garden</i>, Kershaw headed to France for promo and finished a residency at the legendary Hotel Café, a Hollywood coffee shop that has supported the careers of fellow acoustic women Sara Bareilles, Katy Perry, Ingrid Michaelson, and Meiko. Kershaw toured Canada and the States, followed by another trip to France in the spring of 2014. This last year has been spent mostly on the road, with small breaks to stay at home and hole up in her room and write. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Traveling so much has got Kershaw addicted. “I’ve been in L.A. for the last couple of months, and I feel like I need the daily change. It’s becoming a bit of a habit [to be on the road],” she gushes. “There’s something really thrilling about not knowing — every day you meet a bunch of people and learn about them and their lives. I really get curious about people on tour and I end up asking a million questions. And I probably frighten all of them.” </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">On her wish list of places to tour are India, Ireland and Scotland — but especially Ireland and Scotland. The attraction has to do with their dark, romantic rainy-ness. Plus, she’d fit right in. “I’m a redhead, I’ve got freckles and I’m pale. I feel like I’d be amongst my people,” Kershaw laughs.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Speaking of redheads, Kershaw has this grand idea she has yet to propose to British acoustic star Ed Sheeran: the Redhead Only Tour. Redheads would perform, work on production, sell tickets, and volunteer as clean-up crew. “I think it would be so funny. [I want to] show some ginger love to a dying breed,” she says. “Tell all your redhead friends that they’ll get free tickets.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In a note of seriousness, Kershaw admitted that someone tried to kidnap her once. “But I can’t talk about that,” she says, somberly, before unleashing some details. “I did have a situation where somebody wanted me to leave with them and security was called. Life is weird as a musician!” When asked whether she would put the escapade into a song, she laughs. “I think I’m just gonna try to avoid kidnappers in the future — nobody come take a nap near me! Maybe that will be the song. <i>No naps allowed</i>.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Contrary to her bubbly, effervescent personality, Kershaw’s music speaks of another side of this adorable songstress — a darker, aching side haunted by nostalgia. <i>Midnight in the Garden</i> is filled with stories of heartbreak and death. “The first record I wrote was between the ages of 17 and 21, and it was the transitory time when you’re figuring out new aspects of yourself and you’re having some real life experiences.” </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">There’s been a lot of loss for Kershaw — a close high school friend of hers passed away shortly after leaving for college, a good friend and “Sons of Anarchy”<i> </i>actor named Johnny Lewis died tragically in 2012 and just in the last two weeks she’s experienced the death of her grandfather and a best friend’s father. These experiences have inspired this already-prolific writer. “I’ve been writing a lot more than usual just because there are more things on my mind, a lot more things I wanna get out of my body. Different types of sadness.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Lily Kershaw’s art is that she takes the hard stuff from life — death, breakups, loneliness, depression — and places them into a song as a way of healing. It’s a way to take life head on and receive closure, and this feeling of compassion and triumph resonates with her adoring audience, who has made sure that <i>Midnight in the Garden</i> hit the #5 spot on iTunes Singer/Songwriter Album Chart. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Songwriting allows Kershaw to maintain her ordinarily happy, sweet, grateful self; a girl whose friends call her “baby cat” and whose life aspirations include touring with Damien Rice and saving all the elephants in the world. In addition to her thanks for the existence of motorcycle boots, the color black and Paul Simon, big thanks from Kershaw goes to her record label Nettwerk for giving her creative control. </span></span></p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Other studios expect the artist to be an idea. I don’t want to be an idea. I want to be a feeling and a person … you can’t put that in a machine. And I don’t think people want a machine. I think people want people.”</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><i>Lily Kershaw is headlining SOhO on Wednesday, Sept. 10 at 7:30 p.m. as part of her “Like the Sun Tour” through the States and Canada.
