Capps Center’s forum on Ethics and Public Policy, will focus on how legislation can address sexual assault and how institutions of higher learning use disciplinary codes to penalize perpetrators of sexual assault without holding them criminally liable. Jackson and Williams have both introduced legislation this year focusing on college administrations’ mechanisms for enforcing sexual assault policies.</p>\n<p>Williams recently introduced several bills to the state assembly to combat sexual assault, including AB 967, which would extend perpetrator sentences to at least two years of suspension up to expulsion; AB 968, which would require academic transcripts to indicate if a student is ineligible to re-enroll; and AB 969, which would allow community colleges to suspend or expel perpetrators as well as require them to disclose information regarding their history of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, California universities are not doing enough to address sexual assault on campus.</p>\n<p>“More needs to be done to provide a safe and secure environment for our students at our higher education institutions,” Williams said in an email. “We must ensure that our campuses are investigating crimes, prosecuting perpetrators, and providing support and resources to victims.”</p>\n<p>Williams said there is a very low conviction rate for sexual assault cases because they require evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>“This [amount of hard evidence] is very difficult to achieve given the nature of the crime,” Williams said in an email. “There needs to be some consequences for committing sexual assault and my bills are attempting to make that easier to achieve.”</p>\n<p>Jackson recently introduced a bill titled SB-695, which would require high school health courses to include instruction on affirmative consent, sexual harassment, assault, violence and healthy relationships. According to Jackson, proactive sexual assault prevention starts with early education about healthy relationships and consent for both male and female students.</p>\n<p>“If we want to prevent sexual assault, it’s important that we start early,” Jackson stated in a press release. “This bill will ensure that discussions about healthy relationships and consent are taking place in high school.”</p>\n<p>Hannah Bartlebaugh, undergraduate assistant at the Capps Center and fourth-year political science and psychology double major, said she helped with media outreach for the event and hopes it will shed light on the public policy conversation in progress at a statewide level about sexual assault on campus.</p>\n<p>“I hope it brings greater light, not only to the issue … but also to what policy work is being done to address it,” Bartlebaugh said.</p>\n<p>Williams said he is speaking at Lotte Lehmann in order to help spark discussion about sexual assault on add campus and get students to advocate for policies that will combat and end sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“I hope we’ll have a productive conversation about how to change campus policies to make it easier for survivors of sexual assault to get justice and not have to continue going to school with their assailants,” Williams said in an email.</p>\n<p>Gregory Jarrett from Walter H. Capps for the Study of Ethics, Religion, and Public Life and coordinator of the Sexual Assault on College Campuses event said that sexual violence on college campuses is not a new issue, but the public is paying attention to the issue now largely because of new acknowledgements made by political entities regarding sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“Campus Sexual violence is a very old problem, but only occasionally is it discussed outside of a few classrooms. It is currently back in the public eye, in part because the Department of Education and the Obama Administration have recognized the argument that this is not just a problem of isolated individuals,” Jarrett stated in an email. “It is also an assault on women, depriving women of an equal right to education under Title IX.”</p>\n<p>Jarrett also said college campuses have been unsuccessful in changing the situation of sexual violence on campus and the community has the opportunity to come together during this event with Williams and Jackson to create productive discourse surrounding the subject.<br>\n“The level of sexual violence against women on campus is a moral outrage. Universities appear to be unable to change the situation without outside support,” Jarrett said in an email. “This is an opportunity for all of us to come together in the spirit of community and openly discuss these issues, and hopefully come to a consensus to actually do something about it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

Storke Plaza as a final event for their Armenian Genocide Centennial Commemoration Week.</p>\n<p>ASA held a weeklong event beginning this past Monday to educate students and the campus community about the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians beginning April 24, 1915, as well as the struggle for the Armenian community to receive United Nations recognition of the genocide years after the massacres occurred. During the Candlelight Vigil at Storke Plaza there will be a moment of silence to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe the fact that Obama is not accepting the Armenian genocide for what it was, which is a genocide, is honestly political cowardice. – Vice President of the Armenian Student Association Alexander Atamian</p></blockquote>\n<p>Vice President of the Armenian Student Association and third-year biology major Alexander Atamian described the event as a week of remembrance for the genocide, which he said occurred under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for eight years during the start of World War I.</p>\n<p>“Every year we have an Armenian Genocide commemoration week and it’s in order to remember the 1.5 million Armenians that were massacred in 1915 to 1923 by the Ottoman regime at the time,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>Atamian said U.S. Senators oftentimes only say they will acknowledge the 1915 massacres as a genocide in order to gain political support from the Armenian community, and then often do not completely follow through.</p>\n<p>“At this point I believe it’s just a political and strategic tactic that senators are using in order to get all of the Armenian votes because they know how strongly Armenians feel about the situation,” Atamian said. “I believe the fact that Obama is not accepting the Armenian genocide for what it was, which is a genocide, is honestly political cowardice.”</p>\n<p>According to Atamian, in order to prevent future genocides it is necessary for the global community to recognize all past genocides that have occurred, particularly the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“There are other genocides in the world that are happening every day and we need to step up morally and defend those who are being massacred,” Atamian said. “In order for there to not be future genocides we need to acknowledge and accept the ones that have occurred — the first one of the 20th century being the Armenian Genocide.”</p>\n<p>Atamian said ASA integrated other ethnic groups in their commemoration this year in acknowledgement that other groups were also massacred during the time of the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“This year we did something different where we had a Assyrian individual approach us and asked us if we would also share their story as well in our commemoration, which we did … because during that time others were annihilated,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>According to Atamian, as a part of the Armenian Genocide commemoration week, ASA put up a miniature version of the Armenian Genocide Memorial across from Storke to represent the 12 provinces that belonged to Armenia before the genocide occurred.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The consensus of historians who study genocide say that what happened … in 1915, where a million-and-a-half people probably died, fits anybody’s definition of genocide. – Professor Paul Spickard</p></blockquote>\n<p>“[What] we started to do last year was put up the silver memorial along with the 12 slabs … it’s basically a miniature of the Armenian Genocide memorial that is in Yerevan, which is the capital of Armenia … the 12 slabs representing the 12 provinces that belonged to historical Armenia,” Atamian said.</p>\n<p>Paul Spickard, a professor who focuses on 20th-century U.S. social and cultural history, said although some historians disagree, most historians have come to a consensus that admits the Armenian Genocide fits the definition of a “genocide.”</p>\n<p>“The consensus of historians who study genocide say that what happened … in 1915, where a million-and-a-half people probably died, fits anybody’s definition of genocide,” Spickard said. “That’s the consensus of historians but there are historians who disagree with that.”</p>\n<p>Spickard also said the Armenian Genocide fits the United Nations’ definition of genocide because it was a direct attempt to annihilate the Armenian population.</p>\n<p>“It was clearly ethnically directed and that’s one of the criteria for genocide,” Spickard said. “When the United Nations was founded they came up with a definition for genocide as an attack or attempt to destroy an entire ethnic group and it clearly was that.”</p>\n<p>According to Spickard, because the U.S. is an ally to Turkey and Turkey refuses to admit its past aggressions, the U.S. is in a difficult political situation in regard to identifying the 1915 massacre as a genocide.</p>\n<p>“Turkey is part of NATO, Turkey is one of the major players in Middle-Eastern politics and … of those players they are the only one with a democracy. So they are an ally,” Spickard said. “The United States really needs Turkey to be a strong counterbalance to Iran … [and] Turkey doesn’t want to face their reality.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year cultural anthropology major and member of cultural sorority Alpha Gamma Alpha Vicki Deirboghossian said many people outside of the Armenian community participated in the event “Handprint Against Genocide” on this past Tuesday to show their support for students advocated for Armenian genocide recognition.</p>\n<p>“At Handprints Against Genocide … from what I observed a lot of people that weren’t Armenian or weren’t associated [with ASA] actually did participate,” Deirboghossian said.</p>\n<p>Deirboghossian said it is rewarding to see others at the university care about the Armenian Genocide.</p>\n<p>“It’s cool to see, being at a primarily white multicultural university and finding that people actually do care, it’s very rewarding,” Deirboghossian said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year English major Katrine Lalaian said it is important for students to be aware of the Armenian Genocide because after a century many people do not know it even occurred.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really important thing … since it’s our centennial and a lot of people don’t even know what it is,” Lalaian said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-23/armenian-students-hold-candelight-vigil/","id":2799,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[2798,2797,2796],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Melgoza Pushes for Change","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Second-year student will file a complaint stating that the university violated her Title IX rights","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>Second-year student will file a complaint stating that the university violated her Title IX rights</h2>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy major Alejandra Melgoza plans to file a complaint against the university for violating her Title IX rights while dealing with her sexual assault case, which was first brought up to the Office of Judicial Affairs over a year ago on March 13, 2014.</p>\n<p>Title IX is enforced by the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education and forbids any education program or activity which receives federal funds from discriminating on the basis of a person’s sex. Title IX is intended to end sex discrimination in all areas of education and has been applied to cases regarding sexual harassment and sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Melgoza’s sexual assault allegedly took place last year on Jan. 18, after which she filed for an investigation on Oct. 2014 after speaking to both Counseling and Psychology Services (C.A.P.S.)  and Campus Advocacy Resource and Education (C.A.R.E.)  in the Women’s Center about the assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Where Melgoza Says It Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>Melgoza said the reason she did not file for investigation until seven months after first approaching Judicial Affairs was because of their reaction to her case. She said she was discouraged by the Judicial Affairs officials who claimed that her case might just be about the perpetrator’s lack of performance during sex.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I didn’t file the investigation on March 13 was because I was discouraged to file it because they told me that maybe it was just … bad sex … what the official had said was … ‘If he was drunk maybe he didn’t perform as well,’” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza also said Judicial Affairs discouraged her by pointing out that she did not have the evidence to win a case and that the process to file it would be lengthy.</p>\n<p>“They were saying, ‘Well it’s going to be a long process, where [there’s] not enough evidence, you’re not going to be able to win,’ and at that point I was very upset and angry… and at that point I was just like, ‘You know what, fine, I guess I won’t file it,’” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>After filing the investigation, Melgoza allegedly repeatedly asked Judicial Affairs to not allow her perpetrator to enter her workspace before they gave into her requests in November.</p>\n<p>“Finally, at the end of November, they ended up getting him out of my job,” Melgoza said. “If I didn’t demand it then they probably wouldn’t have listened to me. They would have just given up.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Case Conclusions and Enforcement</strong></p>\n<p>Melgoza said it was decided by Judicial Affairs in January that she had enough evidence to file a charge against her perpetrator under Section 102.08 of the Student Code of Conduct, which allows campus regulations to apply to certain off-campus behaviors, including sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“In January … I got a phone call from Judicial Affairs and they ended up telling me that, yes, there was enough evidence to file a charge of sexual assault which in the student code is code 102.08,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>An email sent from Sexual Violence Conduct Committee (SVCC) Co-Chairperson Miles Ashlock to Acting Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Mary Jacob revealed the Committee met on Feb. 6 to hear the charges against Melgoza’s assailant and voted 3-0 that there was “sufficient evidence” that her alleged perpetrator was “responsible for sexually assaulting” Melgoza.</p>\n<p>On March 2, Melgoza received the decision from Jacob that the alleged assailant would be suspended for the Spring and Summer quarters of 2015, meaning he would not take classes or be allowed on university property.</p>\n<p>“I waited 15 days for the Vice Chancellor to make her decision … and in the first week of March I received a letter and an email saying that my perpetrator was suspended for spring of 2015 and summer of 2015,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>The March email from Jacob stated the three-member Sexual Violence and Conduct Committee “recommended a two quarter suspension,” without explanation for how the punishment was determined to be appropriate for the crime. Jacob approved the verdict of the SVCC, finalizing the decision by writing, “I find that I concur with the Committee’s recommendation and therefore suspend you for two quarters,” the email read.</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, the alleged perpetrator was seen on campus by a friend in the first week of ring Quarter although she had the sanction in writing, indicating the Judicial Affairs was not enforcing the sanction on which they had decided.</p>\n<p>“Third day of my spring quarter, week one, one of my best friends … told me that she had seen him on campus,” Melgoza said. “In writing it clearly says that he cannot be anywhere affiliated with UCSB … the administration needs to know how to enforce their sanctions.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said although she would like to discuss a change of policies with Judicial Affairs, she is uncomfortable and will not be dealing with them regarding her own case any longer. Melgoza said she will be filing the Title IX complaint because many students go through the same process with Judicial Affairs and do not see justice.</p>\n<p>“I am done with Judicial Affairs. I would like to negotiate with them about policies and changes that need to be made but regarding my case I am not comfortable talking to them anymore,” Melgoza said. “I’m going to file Title IX because this is just an injustice and it happens to so many students.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she felt disrespected by the university for their mishandling of her sexual assault case.</p>\n<p>“I just felt completely not listened to and not respected by the institution as a whole because at the end of the day, I’ve been through every outlet possible … and I still haven’t had a result,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Soojin Ro said the sanction given to the perpetrator was not harsh enough and could not ensure that he does not sexually assault another person.</p>\n<p>“I think that the consequence for him is too weak since suspension isn’t enough to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Ro said.</p>\n<p>Ro also said however there are different degrees of sexual assault, and depending on the details of the crime there should be harsher or weaker punishments.</p>\n<p>“If there is a first, second and third degree in murder, then sexual assault also has different degrees that relates to different punishments, so it depends on the details of the case,” Ro said.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes Can Occur</strong></p>\n<p>Melgoza said the only way change can occur in the system is through student pressure on the university to take action. She also added that this is difficult because it is a task that requires a lot of persistence.</p>\n<p>“If enough students file enough complaints and if they put more pressure onto the university then the university has to make changes,” Melgoza said, “because unfortunately the university does not feel the pressure because it is such a hard topic that it is draining.”</p>\n<p>According to Melgoza, it is vital that mental health professionals and more C.A.R.E. advocates on campus are made available on campus for students in need.</p>\n<p>“Mental health is so important and we need to increase the amount of staff that we have in mental health because it is just very necessary- extremely necessary for students,” Melgoza said. “As well as more advocates in C.A.R.E. because only four advocates in C.A.R.E. is not enough for the amount of cases that are handled at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Director of Counseling and Psychological Services Jeanne Stanford has stated on the C.A.P.S. website that as a personal mission, she intends to make counseling easily accessible to any student in need of it, while also eliminating the shame some students feel when seeking counseling.</p>\n<p>“One of my main goals is to make counseling available and accessible to all students,” Stanford stated. “I also strongly believe in erasing the stigma sometimes associated with seeking help so that students … know that counseling is indeed meant for all of us.”</p>\n<p>According to Stanford, there are multiple campus groups that mean to help sexual assault survivors and assist student recovery from unhealthy romantic relationships.</p>\n<p>“We have two healing after-sexual assault groups,” Stanford said. “And we also have a group called Empowering Us: Finding Wellness in Romantic Relationships, which has been a group where people can explore unhealthy romantic relationships that they’ve been in.”</p>\n<p>Director of News and Media Relations for the Office of Public Affairs and Communications George Foulsham said in a press release that the university offers support services 24-hours a day, seven days a week through C.AR.E. He stated that C.A.R.E. can help students report misconduct through multiple options, including filing a complaint via Title IX, the police and Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p>“The university provides individuals with confidential advocacy services through C.A.R.E., our Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct. These support services are available 24/7,” Foulsham stated in an email. “C.A.R.E. advocates can help students understand and access reporting options through Title IX, police and the Office of Judicial Affairs.”</p>\n<p>Foulsham also said he hopes to continue discussion on concerns that have been raised to the attention of the university.</p>\n<p>“We take concerns raised by our students extremely seriously and as such we look forward to having an opportunity to meet with our students involved in today’s action to continue to discuss their concerns in detail,” Foulsham said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Stanford, C.A.P.S. is an ally to the survivor community on campus. She wants students to know that C.A.P.S. provides services to help student heal after instances of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“C.A.P.S. is obviously an ally to the survivor community whether they’re male, female, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender,” Stanford said. “We do believe in helping students … We have healing after sexual assault groups here and that’s a kind of service that C.A.P.S. provides.”</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on the page 4 of Thursday, April 16, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62493\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62493\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/melgoza-pushes-for-change/","id":2824,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[2823,2822,2821],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Don’t Pass Up Passover: Chocolate-covered Matzah","category":"On the Menu","subcategory":"Recipes","publish_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chocolate-covered-matzah-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chocolate-covered-matzah-1.jpg?resize=682%2C455&ssl=1","description":"Chocolate-covered Matzah tastes like a combination of a heath bar, peanut brittle and chocolate — in other words, heaven.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Anyone catch Ridley Scott’s “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” the recent adaptation of the story of Moses on the big screen? Although it only got a 28 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and enraged many viewers because of its possible historical inaccuracies, I challenge that, because it was entertaining, action-packed and accurate regarding certain aspects of the story of Exodus. Of course, I am biased because Christian Bale has been my number-one since I was nine years old and watched “Empire of the Sun.” The reason I mention this is that this week marks 3,326 years since the Jews’ exodus from Egypt.</p>\n<p>This week, Jews all over the world are celebrating Passover, a holiday celebrating the emancipation of the Jewish slaves from Egypt. Before they were freed, it is said that God cast ten plagues on the Egyptians including turning their water to blood, giving them lice and boils and causing the death of their firstborns — all because Pharaoh, a real jerk of a king, wouldn’t listen to Moses’ plea, “Let my people go!” When Pharaoh finally relinquished the Jews and gave them their freedom, they left in a hurry hoping he wouldn’t change his mind. They were in such a rush that they did not have time to allow their bread to rise — imagine the haste! For this reason, Jews do not eat leavened bread during the eight days of Passover while they revisit the stories of their people’s enslavement and celebrate their freedom.</p>\n<p>Instead, we eat Matzah, an unleavened bread. Some will tell you it tastes like cardboard or an unsalted piece of burnt cracker, but I disagree. There are countless recipes that use Matzah including the infamous Matzah ball soup. My cousin, Kate, makes the most delicious chocolate-covered Matzah ever, which I anxiously await eating for dessert every Passover! This year, I managed to bargain the recipe out of her and have already accepted the fact that I will probably gain an extra 10 pounds since I can now make my favorite dessert any time I wish.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I’m going to share my wealth with you.

The plaintiff alleges that the Sheriff’s Department violated their own Law Enforcement Services Manual by not investigating the department’s former incidents of contact with Rodger and not performing a background check on California’s gun registration system after receiving complaints about Rodger’s violent tendencies. Cherchian’s brief also alleges the county, Sheriff’s Department and the UC Regents violated policy manuals, the Psychiatric Emergency Team Regulations and the Firearm Policy  by not requesting or providing a mental health evaluation by a licensed clinician after receiving a welfare check request from Rodgers’s mother, Chin Rodgers, on April 30, 2014.</p>\n<p>Because of these violations, Cherchian alleges the defendants deprived him of his right to be free from personal injury and threat of death, claiming each of the accused are legally responsible for the injuries and damages he sustained on May 23, 2014.</p>\n<p>The case brief states the Sheriff’s Department and the Regents acted irresponsibly by not acting on the readily available information Rodger himself posted on public websites, which included multiple videos posted to YouTube under his name expressing violent threats. According to the case brief, the Sheriff’s Department also failed to perform a check on the California gun registry or interview any of Rodger’s mental health providers, despite their ability to consult the registry where information on his possession of firearms would have been available.</p>\n<p>“Recklessly and with deliberate indifference … no person from the SBCSD [Sheriff’s Department] or the Regents watched any part of any videos, reviewed any of Rodger’s other online postings, performed any kind of gun ownership or background check, or interviewed any mental health provider where Rodger was a known psychiatric patient,” the case brief states.</p>\n<p>Cherchian’s brief also alleges the Sheriff’s Department is essentially responsible for putting those around Rodger in danger because of their lack of investigation into his background and unstable nature.</p>\n<p>“Through their conduct, the officers impliedly affirmed that Rodger was not dangerous to the public, increasing the existing danger to his roommates, their guests, and the general public, living and interacting with Rodger on a daily basis in the college community about him,” the case brief states.</p>\n<p>According to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office final investigative summary report on the I.V. mass murder released on Feb. 19, while six law enforcement officers responded to the welfare check request made by Chin Rodger, the sheriff’s deputies found no risk factors that justified a search of Rodger’s apartment or an involuntary mental health hold.</p>\n<p>“[Rodger] explained he was having trouble fitting in socially in Isla Vista,” the report states. “The videos were merely a way of expressing himself. There was nothing during the contact with the suspect that gave deputies reason to believe he was a danger to himself or others.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry and math major Jose Brizuela said he believes the Sheriff’s Department should not be the target of Cherchian’s lawsuit because he feels law enforcement did their jobs to the best of their ability.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like the sheriffs should be the people they go for because they were just doing their job to begin with,” Brizuela said. “Even when everything happened, they tried their hardest to stop [Rodger].”</p>\n<p>Brizuela also said this lawsuit may set a precedent for more victims to come forward against the Sheriff’s Department, the Regents and the County.</p>\n<p>“If this guy’s medical bills get paid off and whatever he wants to gets paid off, I’m sure other people will try and do the same,” Brizuela said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year mechanical engineering major Caroline Park said Rodger’s parents are more to blame than the Sheriff’s Department because she believes they were aware Rodger had purchased weapons and was a potential danger.</p>\n<p>“When I first read about the case, I definitely thought that his parents were more in the wrong than anyone else,” Park said. “They had the most information. They knew he had guns. They knew that he was dangerous.”</p>\n<p>According to the report on the shooting, Rodger’s parents had been informed by his life coach about the manifesto and YouTube videos, but had no knowledge of his weapons and did not view him as a threat to others.</p>\n<p>“Sheriff’s detectives … spoke with both of the suspect’s parents, Peter and Chin Rodger, by telephone. The parents were in the process of driving to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles,” the report states. “Both were worried about their son based on the manifesto that had been emailed earlier that evening, but they both found it very difficult to believe that their son either owned weapons or would actually hurt anyone.”</p>\n<p>Park also said the Sheriff’s Department has a duty to protect the rights of citizens living in I.V. and were in a difficult position during the welfare check on April 30, 2014. Park said she believes that if law enforcement had searched Rodger’s apartment and found nothing, it would be assumed they were violating his rights and would set a bad precedent.</p>\n<p>“I think either way it could have gone wrong. If they were able to search his house and find something, that would have been great,” Park said. “But if it didn’t happen that way, that would be violating his rights. That could happen to any one of us in I.V. and I think that sets a bad example.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Director of news and media relations at the Office of Public Affairs, George Foulsham, declined to comment on the case, stating the university does not comment on pending litigation.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the Santa Barbara County Counsel and Cherchian’s legal team did not respond to requests for comment.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62001\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62001\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-02/shooting-victim-files-complaint-against-county-sheriff-regents/","id":4758,"author":{"id":166,"name":"Erin Gurewitz"},"related":[4757,4756,4755],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Purim: A Time to Drink, Eat and be Merry","category":"On the Menu","subcategory":"Recipes","publish_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/On-The-Menu_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/On-The-Menu_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399&ssl=1","description":"Tomorrow is without a doubt the most joyous holiday on the Jewish Calendar, Purim, partly because of Hamantashen. Make the traditional triangular, jam filled cookie with this recipe","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Tomorrow is without a doubt the most joyous holiday on the Jewish Calendar, Purim. It’s an age old tale that the Jewish nation has survived many enemies wishing to destroy it, and Purim celebrates one of these survivals said to have occurred over 2000 years ago.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Jews tell the story of a Jewish girl who changed her name to Esther to hide her identity. King Ahasuerus of the Persian Empire fell in love with her, and she became Queen. During this time, the King’s prime minister, Haman, convinced the King to order a decree to destroy the Jewish nation. Esther fasted and prayed for three days and then revealed her Jewish identity to the King. He was inevitably pissed that his prime minister tried to kill his wife, so he hung Haman and saved the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>Now that you know the story behind the holiday, I’ll tell you how we celebrate the survival of our people. We eat and we drink!</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On this day, it is actually commanded that we drink — well kind of. It’s commanded to break out of your inhibitions and habits on Purim, and the way we do that is by drinking and toasting “to life”, a lot. It’s all in good spirit, so if drinking turns you into a terrible person rather than just a silly one, I’d stay away from the punch.</p>\n<p>Another tradition during Purim is to give your friends and family special Purim baskets filled with food and gifts. Purim is one of my favorite holidays because every year I go to my grandma’s house to make Hamantashen, which are triangular-shaped cookies with a sweet filling. I don’t know why we only eat these bad boys once a year, because they are scrumptious enough to eat more often.</p>\n<p>I get thrown into a nostalgic state every time I eat a Hamantashen. They make me think of the times I was dressed as a princess and had to stand on a chair to help my grandma roll out the dough. They also remind me of getting easily distracted and singing into my rolling pin instead of using it for its actual purpose. With my grandma’s endless patience, we would make dozens of Hamantashen to give to friends and family.</p>\n<p>To shamelessly brag, our Hamantashen were always extra light, fluffy and perfectly glistening when they came out of the oven. They are really perfect for any occasion. Below is the recipe that we’ve used every year which comes from Spice and Spirit: The Complete Kosher Jewish Cookbook, by Tzuvia Emmer and Tzipora Reitman. It supposedly yields 4 dozen cookies but we make ours extra large so we always end up with fewer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61555\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/On-The-Menu_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"146386518\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61553\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61555\" data-attachment-id=\"61555\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/purim-a-time-to-drink-eat-and-be-merry/on-the-menu_lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/On-The-Menu_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425418672\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"On The Menu\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/On-The-Menu_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/On-The-Menu_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-61555\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/On-The-Menu_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus \" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/On-The-Menu_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/On-The-Menu_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-61555\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 eggs</li>\n<li>1 cup sugar</li>\n<li>1/2 cup oil</li>\n<li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>\n<li>Rind of 1 lemon, grated (although we usually use rind of an Orange instead)</li>\n<li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>\n<li>5 cups of flour</li>\n<li>2 tsps. baking powder</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Preheat oven to 350 °F</li>\n<li>Grease cookie sheet.</li>\n<li>Beat 4 eggs and sugar.

Grewal’s in-depth research about American Muslims discusses whether Islam can be seen as an American religion in the same way that other religions are accepted.</p>\n<p>According to Grewal, there is a common sentiment in the U.S. that assumes Islam contradicts widely-held American values.</p>\n<p>“There is something specific about Islam that for many people makes [them] understand it as kind of the exact antithesis of American values,” Grewal said.</p>\n<p>Quoting Malcolm X’s speech “The Ballot or the Bullet,” Grewal delineated the difference between legal citizenship and social citizenship to convey that American Muslims are still dealing with issues that existed in the 1960’s.</p>\n<p>“I hope what you’ll see when you hear this quote is how much it is still relevant today, the kinds of things he is posing,” Grewal said. “He says … ‘Being here in America doesn’t make you an American. Being born here in America doesn’t make you an American. Why if birth made you an American, you wouldn’t need any legislation; you wouldn’t need any amendments to the Constitution.’”</p>\n<p>According to Grewal, American media has created an obstacle for American Muslims by primarily focusing on of terrorism when any discussion on Islam arises. According to Grewal, this has dramatically changed the way in which American Muslims speak to one another regarding the debate on the reform of Islam.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61301\" style=\"width: 257px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61301\" data-attachment-id=\"61301\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-25/professor-talks-about-muslims-in-the-us/zareena-grewal-speaks-to-a-full-crowd-at-the-mcc-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.2\",\"credit\":\"Sam Aragon\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424774127\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"105\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Reform of Islam/Muslims\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-61301\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-Reform-of-Islam_Sam-Aragon-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=247%2C164\" alt=\"Zareena Grewal speaks to a full crowd at the MCC.

If you are in a relationship, you are bound to get showered with love (a.k.a. gifts and chocolate) by your partner — whether or not your significant other believes Valentine’s Day was made up by Hallmark to make bank is irrelevant. If you are single, it’s the one day a year you can lounge in self-pity and no one can judge you. Honestly, there are probably many more singles in Isla Vista than table-for-twos types, so find your other single friends (those that feel they have utterly failed at life as well as those who boast about their glorious independence) and have a shameless drunken night-in together.</p>\n<p>A lonely hearts club sounds awful and cliche, but it is surprisingly fun as long as you do it right and have the right ingredients. My Valentine’s day will proudly be filled with friends, a mix of bad rom-coms and epic Quentin Tarantino films plus popcorn, cookies and lots of wine to drown my so-called sorrows.</p>\n<p>What’s a movie night without popcorn? It is almost an impossibility for those of us who love popcorn to get bored of that buttery taste. That being said, if you want to try something new there are hundreds of popcorn enhancer recipes. Here are a couple of my favorites:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<h2>Easiest: Add Milk Duds</h2>\n<p>Maybe this sounds disgusting to you, but I promise it’s the opposite.

Red Velvet cookies were basically made to eat on the day that celebrates romance. This Red Velvet cookie recipe is perfect for those of you who want to try something new and don’t have much experience baking because it uses a cake mix, which makes single life even easier.</p>\n<p>Adding the pudding gives a new flavor to the common red velvet cookie taste. The pudding mix also makes the cookie extra light and fluffy. The texture is enjoyable because there is a slight crunch upon the first bite and then a smooth moist middle to savor. This cookie is not extraordinarily sweet, so it pairs well with red wine.</p>\n<h2>Easy: Red Velvet Cake Cookies</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_60823\" style=\"width: 689px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cookies.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1117916990\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60822\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60823\" data-attachment-id=\"60823\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/munch-your-heart-out-three-recipes-to-share-this-valentines-day/cookies/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cookies.jpg?fit=679%2C816&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"679,816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"cookies\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cookies.jpg?fit=208%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cookies.jpg?fit=679%2C816&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-60823\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cookies.jpg?resize=679%2C816\" alt=\"Photo by Erin Gurewitz.\" width=\"679\" height=\"816\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cookies.jpg?w=679&amp;ssl=1 679w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cookies.jpg?resize=208%2C250&amp;ssl=1 208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-60823\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo by Erin Gurewitz.</em></p></div>\n<p>Ingredients:<br>\n1 pkg.
