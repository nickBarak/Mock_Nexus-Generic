It started in 2009, in response to crippling budget cuts, with the idea of an 11th, completely online campus. However, more recent efforts have focused on building partnerships with private online education companies like Coursera, edX and Udacity, which have gained recognition recently for innovations in online learning platforms. The aim has been the same: to make online classes a central part of a UC degree to the tune of 20 percent of total credits by some projections.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I take issue with both the process behind the initiative and the prospect of such an education. But first and foremost, I am appalled by the absurdity of the fact that the same people who constructed the fiscal crisis in the UC system — the governor and the regents — are now determining how we will deal with it. The same group of administrators that has condemned us to institutional poverty is now telling us that we must fundamentally restructure and digitize our curriculum just to stay afloat.</p>\n<p>Their online strategy is fundamentally flawed because it does not address the root of the UC’s budgetary woes, that is, the ongoing financial neglect of higher education in California. Gov. Jerry Brown and the UC Regents are instead trying to paper over this political dilemma with a technological fix. They are counting on rallying our collective fetish for “innovation” and our enthusiasm for new educational technologies as a way of obfuscating the political-budgetary choice they have made to continually subordinate higher education funding to debt servicing and prison production. They want to bury their continued disregard for the UC system in flashy Silicon Valley-branded technologies, which they offer as our only hope of survival.</p>\n<p>Much like the budget cuts of the last five years, the online push is an entirely undemocratic endeavor, a top-down initiative envisaged from the heights of Sacramento and the UC Office of the President and foisted upon a broad base of students and faculty.</p>\n<p>It reminds us again of the peculiar constellation of political power in the UC system. Of the 26 voting members of the UC Board of Regents, only one is a student Outside of two nonvoting members who directly represent faculty, the rest are administrators appointed — not elected — to 12-year terms by the governor.</p>\n<p>This arrangement in which decisions about the UC system are made not by the students and faculty who make up its heart, but by distant, unelected managers, is wholly undemocratic. It is through this machinery that we are being told to move our learning online.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the terms in which online education is being discussed are misguided. Since Gov. Brown and the regents have posited online learning primarily as a way of saving money, the focus of the debate has been trapped in market terms: how it can reduce costs and increase efficiency. There has been relatively little discussion of how online education will (or already does) enhance or degrade the quality of instruction and education.</p>\n<p>The problem is that learning — truly transformative learning that helps you to grow as a person and as a citizen, not just information transfer — simply does not obey the rules of the market. It cannot always be done cheaper and more efficiently with new technology and automation.</p>\n<p>And when the question of the quality of online courses does come up, the administrators who claim to speak for students like to float the idea that our generation of “digital natives” simply learns better on computers than we do in classrooms, that we prefer learning through interactive YouTube videos than we do through intimate face-to-face discussions. I think that is bullshit. They construct that narrative because it is convenient for their agenda.</p>\n<p>I, personally, am tired of the ever-enclosing boundaries that debt-servicing budget cuts artificially construct around our educational experience. Our so-called leaders have locked us in an austerity prison-house and now claim to offer us the only way out.</p>\n<p>More online coursework may have some place at the UC (if the decision makers were grounded, they would see that it already has a place), but it is not a solution for budgetary neglect and it cannot be commanded from above. A successful public university system, one that prepares us to be creative and engaged citizens, requires significant public investment. There is simply no way around it.</p>\n<p><em>Patrick Sheehan is a fourth-year sociology major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>This article appeared online only at dailynexus.com on Friday, May 3, 2013.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51184\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/from-the-makers-of-massive-budget-cuts-a-digital-education/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51184\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/from-the-makers-of-massive-budget-cuts-a-digital-education/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/from-the-makers-of-massive-budget-cuts-a-digital-education/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/from-the-makers-of-massive-budget-cuts-a-digital-education/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/from-the-makers-of-massive-budget-cuts-a-digital-education/","id":5925,"author":{"id":468,"name":"Patrick Sheehan"},"related":[5924,5923,5922],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Romney, Obama and Trees: Environmentalism for the Next Four Years","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Four debates — three presidential and one vice-presidential — and climate change has not been mentioned once.

During their debates the closest the presidential candidates got to addressing the catastrophic ecological crisis was jousting over the price of gasoline and one-upping each other about how much coal and oil each is going to extract. Even in last night’s globally-focused debate in Florida — ground zero for sea-level rise in the U.S. — climate change went ominously unmentioned in debates over America’s ability to project military power.</p>\n<p>Given the degree to which climate change has been screaming for attention in recent years in the form of extreme weather events, it is truly astonishing that Obama and Romney have managed to avoid the subject altogether. The number of “Major Disaster Declarations” by the federal government has doubled in the last 10 years, from 43 in 1991 to 99 in 2011. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2012 so far has seen the most extreme weather in recorded history throughout the contiguous U.S.: crippling droughts in some regions, extreme precipitation in others, uncontrollable wildfires, and the hottest January-August on record. Globally the picture is similar. The summer saw sea ice in the Arctic shrink to its smallest area ever, while flooding and drought plagued the planet from Bangkok to Brazil.</p>\n<p>Such calamities — and the fact that they may constitute a new normal for the planet — add a crucial, though almost completely ignored, dimension to Obama and Romney’s debates over the role of government. Since the State and the public sector (the central object of disagreement in this election) are the only entities with the power and scope to effectively mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change, Romney and the GOP’s ongoing assault on the federal government has serious implications not just for the economy, but for the ecology of the planet.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>First, it is crucial to understand that the state will necessarily be central to any serious attempt to address the climate crisis. The federal government is the only body with the ability to regulate and prevent further greenhouse gas emissions and the only body with the capital and capacity to respond to current climate disasters. If elected, Romney and the GOP will quash these governmental powers and leave the American people — and the planet — at the mercy of a climate gyrating wildly out of control.</p>\n<p>Romney has sworn to rein in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which he calls “a tool in the hands of the President to crush the private enterprise system.” He promises to revoke completely its already limited ability to regulate carbon emissions through the Clean Air Act. This drastic move will essentially guarantee an acceleration of the rate at which we inundate the atmosphere with greenhouse gases.</p>\n<p>Once our ability to prevent further planetary warming has been emasculated, Romney and the GOP plan to take their federal budget wars to the few mechanisms we currently have to respond to climate disasters. They plan to strip the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of more than half of its budget, thereby radically curtailing our ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme weather events. Romney also wants to further downsize federal funds for first responders such as police and firefighters — who have been absolutely indispensable to dealing with this summer’s rampant wildfires.</p>\n<p>Along with these draconian cuts to much-needed disaster-response services, the Republicans’ proposed budget retains a decade’s worth of tax breaks and subsidies for Big Oil to the tune of $45 billion. Not that the oil industry needs the help. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies raked in more than $80 billion in profit while Exxon Mobil pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.</p>\n<p>The Republican platform not only dismantles our abilities to respond to and regulate future climate change, it even subsidies its production.</p>\n<p>While Obama’s recent silence about climate change has been regressive to say the least, he and the Democrats certainly offer a more forward-thinking energy policy than do Romney and the Republicans. Obama’s most important move to date on the climate change front has been to propose the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act — which, had it passed the Congress, would have cut billions of dollars of annual taxpayer subsidies to the top five American oil companies and would have freed up capital to invest in renewable sources.</p>\n<p>None of this much matters if you still deny that climate change is occurring like, say, Vice-Presidential candidate Paul Ryan does. And he is not out of line with the Republican Party. In 2011, the GOP-led House of Representatives defiantly rejected a Democratic amendment calling for Congress to accept the scientific consensus that climate change is occurring, that it is caused in large part by human activity and that it is a threat to human health.</p>\n<p>The climate dimension raises the stakes of the struggles over the state and proves a Romney presidency to be a much more reckless play than previously thought.</p>\n<p><em>Patrick Sheehan is a fourth-year sociology major.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48361\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48361\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-24/romney-obama-trees-environmentalism-years/","id":5986,"author":{"id":468,"name":"Patrick Sheehan"},"related":[5985,5984,5983],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/468"}},"__N_SSG":true}
