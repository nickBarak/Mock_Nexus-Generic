Many people at the demonstration condemned Yang for his empty words and his failure to show up that day. Others referenced the lawsuits filed against the UC Police Department (UCPD) on the Santa Barbara campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In May 2019, the Nexus reported that there were three active lawsuits against current and former members of the UCPD. Since then, more current and former officers have filed their own lawsuits. There are currently </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-26/sixth-ucpd-lawsuit-filed-against-department-alleging-sexual-harassment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">six active lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These lawsuits allege serious misconduct by police officers within the department, including widespread racism and sexism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To date, the university has failed to publicly address these lawsuits, or student concerns that stemmed from learning about them. Students, staff and faculty did not hear a single public assurance that these lawsuits or the misconduct alleged in them would be independently investigated, or that the department would be making any internal changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we did get were stories from The Current, the public relations arm of the university, </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019466/leading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introducing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the new police chief, James Brock, and the </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apparent changes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> he was making to the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Nexus tried to interview Brock after he was first hired in April 2019 and after The Current published a </span><a href=\"https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2019/019649/professionalism-and-service-community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">story</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about his “open-door policy” and “the importance of creating relationships with students and building trust between the student body and the department,” we were stonewalled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any emails we sent to Brock were either ignored or directed to the public affairs department, who told us that Brock was too busy to speak with us directly and that we should email our questions to them, despite us emailing numerous times over the course of a month and offering flexibility in interview times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuits are also not being dealt with publicly. Despite continuously reaching out to the lawyers, the Nexus has not been able to learn much about the progress of any internal mediations. As of April 2020, the university has been conducting an internal investigation into the allegations, according to a lawyer representing several plaintiffs in the lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To this day, the student body knows very little about what is happening within the UCSB Police Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last December, Yang announced the </span><a href=\"https://chancellor.ucsb.edu/memos/2019-12-02-police-advisory-board\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the Police Advisory Board. A memo about the board’s creation was posted to the Office of the Chancellor website, but there was no campus-wide email sent to the student body. Despite its goal of “enhanc[ing] communication between the police department and the campus community,” not a single email has been sent to students about the board’s progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police officers across the nation are protected by a lack of transparency and accountability within the criminal justice system that the UC and UCSB are perpetuating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Yang wants to condemn and address the effects of police misconduct, he needs to start on this campus. Start by being transparent with the student body about what changes were made after the lawsuits were filed and about the disciplinary records of all the officers within the department. Students on this campus deserve to know who is policing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond UCSB, the UC system as a whole needs to do more. UC President Janet Napolitano and Board of Regents Chair John A. Pérez sent out a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-statement-protests-violence-following-george-floyd-s-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Sunday condemning the recent racist killings of Black people and committing to “re-examine our own practices and ensure we continue to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing that we established two years ago.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A former UC student journalist, Gabe Schneider, recently published an article titled “</span><a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/uc-campuses-have-disclosed-virtually-no-records-under-police-transparency-law/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Campuses Have Disclosed Virtually No Records Under Police Transparency Law,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” that drew attention to how little transparency there is within UC police departments across the state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schneider noted that the UC system “is aware of more than 200 incidents involving police use of force on its 10 campuses in recent years. Nearly half of those incidents resulted in the injury of an officer or another person.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yet only two police use of force case files have been released publicly,” Schneider wrote.                                         </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s despite California Senate Bill 1421, a landmark transparency law that went into effect last year. It requires police to turn over internal records involving police shootings and use of force, and instances of sexual assault or lying by on-duty officers,” Schneider continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC needs to release these records, and it needs to be more transparent with students about the misconduct within its police departments. It is not enough to write platitudes in a statement, and it is certainly not enough to say that the UC will “continue to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Universitywide Policing” without explaining what those steps will look like, and how students will directly be impacted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system and UCSB cannot claim to condemn these acts of police violence across the nation while simultaneously shielding records of misconduct within its own police departments. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds believes that her legislative, lobbying and leadership experience with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), among other organizations, gives her the edge over her Campus United opponent, Beau Karnsrithong, a second-year environmental studies and film and media studies double major. The Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both said in their endorsement interviews that they hope to take advantage of the lobbying process and fight for legislation that supports student needs, Karnsrithong has no personal lobbying experience and lacks his opponent’s fluency in drafting legislation and reviewing policy. This is imperative, as the duty of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) is to represent student needs on the UC, state and federal level through means such as lobbying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Karnsrithong struggled to answer basic questions about major student issues, including those about Title IX and even what the role of the EVPSA is. He did not seem to have any concrete platform points that he wanted to accomplish if elected, nor an understanding of what exactly an executive position demands of an individual. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankly, the Nexus does not believe Karnsrithong is a competitive candidate, particularly juxtaposed with Reynolds, who has done a lot of advocacy work outside of A.S. already. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus was impressed with the depth of Reynolds’ platform points, as her well-planned and thought-out approach makes achieving her goals more likely if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having worked on a number of bills with Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, the representative for Santa Barbara County in the State Senate, Reynolds’ legislative experience adds to her ability to advocate for student needs and would aid her in achieving her main goals as EVPSA: providing basic needs for all communities, providing equitable financial aid, increasing funding for mental health resources on campus, protecting survivors’ rights and lobbying for policies to diversify the UC Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Reynolds expanded her background with legislation and policy when she joined SASA as a policy analyst. There, she organized UC Santa Barbara students’ lobbying efforts against United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ proposed amendments to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the Department of Education is currently reviewing Title IX, Reynolds believes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“it’s extremely important that survivors, and all students who could potentially become survivors, are protected from regulations that could detrimentally change the course of their cases and their lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, she plans to make use of the EVPSA’s statewide advocacy platform and her lobbying experience to fight for survivors and “uphold Obama-era Title IX policies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Karnsrithong and Reynolds both agree that Title IX is not effective in its current form, Karnsrithong’s only experience with its policies come from his training as a resident assistant, and he was unable to speak specifically to what changes in Title IX policy needed to be made.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Reynolds does not have previous experience working inside the EVPSA office, she has worked closely with the office and Lobby Corps to host SASA’s first-ever Sexual Assault Awareness Month last April. During that month, she used her legislative experience to explain bills pertaining to sexual assault to students who signed up to lobby.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds became SASA’s president and UCSB director during her junior year. In her new roles, Reynolds worked to increase awareness about sexual assault and gender bias by organzing summits and town halls — many of which were scheduled to take place in April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and have now been canceled due to the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through her involvement with SASA, she also helped create Isla Vista’s first-ever </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-15/center-dedicated-to-helping-victims-of-sexual-violence-opens-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survivor resource center</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October 2019, the product of a partnership between the Isla Vista Community Services District and Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds is also experienced with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the UC Student Association, necessary for the role of EVPSA, who is required to meet with the UC president on behalf of the student body frequently. She currently serves as UCSB’s undergraduate representative to the Title IX Student Advisory Board. Altogether, her history of working directly with the UC Student Association and the UCOP speaks to her qualifications for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of basic needs, Reynolds plans to lobby for legislation that would push the UC to provide better mental health services for students. She also plans to expand the role of Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and the Campus Advocacy Resource &amp; Education Center (C.A.R.E.) through increased funding and a “more diverse staff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also hopes to alleviate food insecurity by working with the A.S. Food Bank and lobbying for legislation that provides support to those who are food insecure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re all fighting for these basic needs as college students. And there shouldn’t be the fact that we have to have certain communities fight harder for them,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds hopes to uplift marginalized groups by facilitating direct feedback from them but maintains that she would not speak on their behalf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think prioritizing not only marginalized communities that are very visible in the community, but also ones that may be less visible, like the undocumented students at UCSB, is important,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain transparency within the EVPSA office — something that Reynolds believes the current EVPSA, Daevionne Beasley, could have done better — she plans to hold town hall-style events where students can come together and hear about the work the EVPSA office is putting out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the nature of the EVPSA office’s budget, Reynolds wants to publicize the office’s expense reports, as “students should know exactly where their student fees are going.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at Reynolds’ work so far, it’s clear that as EVPSA, she would have the experience and drive to continue advocating for students, albeit with a much larger platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My passion for students’ needs and for elevating students’ voices is instrumental in this work,” she said. “I don’t think you can do this type of work without having that passion.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had Karnsrithong waited an extra year to run for EVPSA and taken the time to hone the skills necessary for the role, he could have been a strong contender. But this year, that is not the case. For the 2020-21 EVPSA term, Reynolds’ qualifications speak for themselves, and the Nexus is certain that she’s the right candidate for the job. </span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

For most, a year with that level of responsibility and amidst the party politics of A.S. is enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one year later, Beasley shows no signs of slowing down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Beasley ran for the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position, the Nexus </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">endorsed his opponent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Alexandra Leal Silva, largely due to her three years of experience working in the office in comparison to Beasley, who was an outsider to A.S. at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as we noted in our endorsement of Leal Silva at the time, both she and Beasley were confident, charismatic and genuine leaders who seemed to sincerely care about the well-being of UC Santa Barbara students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley is facing two opponents in this year’s election: third-year sociology major Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who is running with the Isla Vista Party, and second-year cell and developmental biology major Austin Foreman, who is running as an independent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Foreman is not suited for the position of president. It became clear in speaking to him that while he is passionate about what he does, he lacks the tangible experience needed to serve as a representative for the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, he seems to lack a wider understanding of university and any tangible experience outside of A.S. When pressed about his experience and platform points, he faltered, and often talked in circles while failing to explain how he would feasibly pursue them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the largest reasons Foreman gave for running is that he wanted to work on improving the retention of A.S. career staff. While this is an admirable goal, it should not be the reason a student runs to be A.S. president, a position that is meant to serve all students, not just those within A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe that Foreman — who has introduced numerous resolutions focused on helping his fellow students over the past year while serving as an on-campus senator — would have been better off pursuing the position of Internal Vice President. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In regard to Segura-Esquivel, the Nexus believes the third-year student is incredibly capable of being the next A.S. president, if elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the three hours in which we spoke to him, it became clear he has acquired the wide range of knowledge needed to be this campus’ A.S. president and that his passion for students is nearly unmatched. He stressed that his identity as a “brown, queer, first generation, low-income student” has allowed him to be at the forefront of campus issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of his platform points — centered around helping students with basic needs as well as establishing emergency protocols — are not particularly innovative, as they echo ones proposed both this year and the year before by candidates running for A.S. positions. But Segura-Esquivel, refreshingly, was able to back up his platform points with detailed plans for accomplishing them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, during our interview, Segura-Esquivel often went on tangents and strayed far from the question at hand. While we appreciated his enthusiasm, his answers brought into question his ability to effectively communicate on behalf of students to administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley, in comparison, was an approachable candidate who was able to get his point across easily, which assured us of his ability to do the same with both the average student and administrator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, in any other election year, Segura-Esquivel would be the clear choice for our endorsement. But due to Beasley’s year of executive experience and his extensive history of advocacy for UCSB students, the Nexus chose Beasley for our endorsement, with the firm belief that he would be the best president for our campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As EVPSA, Beasley seemingly worked tirelessly to help advocate on behalf of students; the EVPSA is a unique position within A.S., involving extensive lobbying and traveling between D.C. and Sacramento. In addition to serving as EVPSA, Beasley is also a resident assistant this year. His ability to balance the two intensive time commitments while taking classes is certainly impressive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even with these hurdles, Beasley helped bring to fruition </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-28/uc-gains-4-million-in-funding-for-summer-financial-aid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10 million in summer financial aid</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for students through his role with the Coalition for a Better UC and countlessly lobbied on behalf of UCSB students as EVPSA, speaking repeatedly to both UC administrators, including UC President Janet Napolitano, and elected officials in California and Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his interview with the Nexus, Beasley made clear his vast knowledge of the campus, speaking extensively to both his history with the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Student Union demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as advocating against </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty Meter Telescope Project at Mauna Kea</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which the UC helps fund. He noted that he hopes to continue both projects if elected president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of Beasley’s platform points fall under two categories, he explained in his interview: access and advocacy. He wants to continue current A.S. President Alison Sir’s projects, including her </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-18/proposed-vending-machine-in-i-v-aimed-at-addressing-food-insecurity-in-near-future/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vending machine project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — a project aimed at providing food to low-income students — as well as finding a permanent location for the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-15/committee-moves-forward-with-plans-for-permanent-a-s-bike-shop/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bike shop</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, something also pursued by Sir’s predecessor, former A.S. President Brooke Kopel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of [Sir’s] goals were cut short by COVID … I definitely want to make sure that those projects have a home in my office and [are seen] through to completion,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that he also wants to focus on returning free night and weekend parking to students, who initially voted for </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/students-in-2003-voted-for-free-night-and-weekend-parking-sixteen-years-later-where-is-it/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“free” night and weekend parking</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through a lock-in fee in 2003. But that “free” parking only lasted five years; now, if students want to park on campus during nights and weekends, they are required to purchase a $52.50 permit that lasts for three quarters. Beasley said he has already had a few conversations with Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) over this issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Foreman, Beasley also aims to make sure students have “adequate access” to mental health resources and know their options, if elected. He noted that “you never really know what you’re getting into when you go [to C.A.P.S.],” adding that “C.A.P.S. isn’t for everybody.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first went [to C.A.P.S.], there were no available Black psychologists. And when I asked for one, I kind of got laughed at. I ended up being able to go out into the community to find Acacia Health and Wellness,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to many executive candidates this year, Beasley hopes to establish a standardized emergency response protocol at the university. He explained that in his time at UCSB, he’s seen a gap between the administration and its students when times of emergencies struck, such as during the 2017 Thomas Fire and the current coronavirus pandemic. He noted that he had “countless meetings” with administrators to help address students’ needs before the coronavirus shut down the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that there needs to be more outreach between the administration and students in terms of advocacy, particularly on administrators’ parts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students are constantly having to go to [administrators’ doors] … ‘Can we have a meeting? Can we talk about this? Where’s the funding for Black students? Where’s the funding for Native American students?’ That shouldn’t have to be a recurring conversation,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Next year as president, I will make sure that administration is able to reach out to students and ask them what they need instead of the other way around,” he continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the Nexus believes that Beasley’s passion, combined with the relationships he already has with UC administration, gives him a leg up over anyone else. He has also shown the ability to adapt through his time in office, tacking on projects he hadn’t run on, like the TMT project, and turning them into major initiatives for his office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Beasley will use this tangible experience as EVPSA to his benefit if elected president; he has worked incredibly hard to highlight efforts that otherwise may have slipped through the cracks. He has proven time and time again over this year as EVPSA that he has the ability to advocate for change at the highest levels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected as the next president, the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that Beasley will not only continue the work he is already doing, but use his unique qualifications to truly listen to his constituents and go above and beyond to create tangible change on this campus.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

id=\"caption-attachment-94020\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Lea Toubian</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus believes that Toubian’s experiences working as a senator and with local campaigns in I.V., in addition to her specific goals if elected, have lent Toubian an advantage over her opponent, Yasamin Salari, who is running with the Isla Vista Party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that is not to say that Salari would not do well in the position — while Toubian has the edge, we believe that both candidates are incredibly qualified to serve as External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA). Our campus would be in good hands regardless of who is elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian’s platform focuses on increasing the I.V. community’s access to its local government and addressing student needs in times of crisis, which includes creating a cohesive emergency response plan that involves the university, the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and other organizations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Toubian aims to increase voter registration among both students and I.V. residents, develop proactive responses to sexual assault in I.V., hold landlords accountable for cliff erosion in I.V. and continue environmental projects such as the I.V. Compost Collective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Nexus does doubt the feasibility of Toubian’s goal to hold landlords accountable in addressing cliff erosion during her term as EVPLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian’s involvement with Campus Democrats her freshman year allowed her to embed herself in the community and foster personal connections with the I.V. CSD. She also worked as the external director of Associated Students Lobby Corps and was involved in the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure R campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which secured funding for the I.V. CSD in 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her sophomore year, Toubian served as both an on-campus senator and as the secretary of Campus Democrats. After she returned from studying abroad this year, she took a position as the chief of staff for current Internal Vice President Alli Adam. Toubian believes that her time working with the Senate has prepared her for the role of EVPLA, despite not having worked directly with the office before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to learn a lot about the communities that exist at UCSB. I had to learn about how to listen and uplift other people’s voices instead of putting mine ahead of them,” Toubian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instead of imparting my own biases on someone or a group of people, instead of speaking on behalf of people, [I learned] how to be the representative and actually uplift their voices using the platform that you’re given.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By working as chief of staff for Adam, Toubian said the position, along with her involvement in Campus Democrats, allowed her to stay connected with various groups on and off campus. Pulling from her experiences from Campus Democrats, she also sees voter registration for the upcoming November election as a priority for the office.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian also identified various issues around campus that she would like to address using the full power of the EVPLA office, including food insecurity, housing issues and sexual assault in Isla Vista.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The benefit of having an office under you is that you could also specifically delegate people to make one issue or a small handful of issues their priority, which I think is a lot more effective than having one person try to tackle and say that they’re going to tackle every single issue,” Toubian said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re each able to tackle and be the spearheads for each issue and they can become experts on the topic. There are people who are passionate and most importantly, they’re people who have relevant experiences with that [issue],” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian also hopes to expand access to resources by widening normal outreach through Facebook and door-to-door canvassing, particularly for the non-student population in I.V., by providing translation services for non-English speakers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Toubian is receiving our endorsement, the Nexus believes that Salari would also do well in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari served as an on-campus senator on the 69th Senate but </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was removed in Winter Quarter 2018</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for violating the eligibility requirement for the position, which states that on-campus senators must live amongst their constituents. In her interview with the Nexus, Salari cited financial issues as the reason she moved off campus and said that her work in the EVPLA office over the past few months inspired her to run for the position of EVPLA and improve it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari’s platform focuses on expanding on the university’s timely warning system to include any incidents of violence in I.V., not just on campus-associated property. She said she also hopes to work with Students Against Sexual Assault, Take Back the Night, the Title IX office and the Interfraternity Council to establish monthly meetings to assess the campus’ sexual assault climate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Toubian is well-versed in the I.V. CSD’s structure and its work, Salari had more tangible experience than Toubian in working directly with the I.V. CSD, as she currently serves as the I.V. CSD coordinator in the EVPLA office under Christian Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through this role, she became familiar with the projects of past EVPLAs, such as the police collaborative board, to address safety issues between students and police, a project she hopes to continue. It was also clear that she is knowledgeable about the various entities that the EVPLA and the I.V. CSD work closely with and has working relationships with many of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salari also wants to provide a direct bus shuttle between I.V. and Camino Real Marketplace for students to acquire essential groceries, but she was not able to provide a tangible plan or distinguish why her plan was different from the bus lines already in place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also recognized the importance of groups in I.V. besides students, such as the houseless population and families, and wants to work to establish a line of communication through the EVPLA office to learn more about non-student populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout her interview, it was clear that Salari was the candidate who had her ear to the ground in I.V. and on campus and would likely raise more awareness of the EVPLA office among students and student groups. Toubian, whose experience was more political, would benefit from Salari’s student-oriented approach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Nexus believes that Toubian’s experience lends her to be a better fit for the position of EVPLA, we acknowledge that both candidates’ work and familiarity with the office and I.V. speak to their qualifications for the job.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

It’s made up of a handful of student caseworkers, who are assigned to students charged with committing disciplinary violations, such as violating a housing contract or academic dishonesty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez’s opponent, current Off-Campus Senator Tyler Ferguson, has done a great deal of important work during his time on the Senate, including putting forward a bill to create two </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-26/a-s-senate-amendment-puts-two-international-student-senator-seats-onto-spring-ballot/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international student senator positions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, both through the Nexus’ interviews with the candidates as well as our previous knowledge of their work, we believe Ferguson would have been better suited for another year at the Senate table instead of the position of S.A.G. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her interview with the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, Perez demonstrated a strong understanding of the issues facing students and a drive to expand the visibility and accessibility of the OSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a senator last year, my second year, and I became very familiar with the institution,” Perez said. “I have two friends who dropped out of UCSB because of financial reasons, or because they weren’t supported as a first-gen student.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve come to know the university and its flaws, and I’ve lived personally the experiences of first-gen students and difficulties through their time at UCSB,” Perez added. “I know that I am capable of improving resources or helping students access the university in better ways.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez served as a senator during the 2018-19 school year and declared candidacy for S.A.G. last spring, but later dropped out of the election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was really drained last year, and I was going through some personal things, and I definitely was not ready to run a campaign for S.A.G., and I was not the person I needed to be in order to deliver the candidate I believed students deserve for the position,” Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I took a year off, I thought a lot about things, I grew, I healed and I’m back,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last year, Perez has worked as the co-fundraising chair for La Familia de Colores, which she described as a Latinx organization “for queer people of color to be able to have a family, a sense of belonging outside of university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez said that she has been working at various fast food places and businesses since she was 15, gathering experiences that she believes have contributed to her preparation for S.A.G.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I learned to value a lot of jobs outside of academia, and my experiences outside of it have given me the ability to be able to respond more holistically to students’ issues,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected as the next S.A.G., Perez has a number of platform points that the Nexus believes will move the OSA forward and allow it to better serve students at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez hopes to establish a division of caseworkers specifically dedicated to serving undocumented students, lower the GPA requirement for academic probation, set up online appointments for the OSA and eliminate the $60 </span><a href=\"https://alcohol.sa.ucsb.edu/services/case\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College Alcohol and Substance Education</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (C.A.S.E.) fee. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking specifically to her platform point of lowering the GPA requirement for academic probation, Perez noted that a lot of students tend to lose their financial aid if they are on academic probation, adding that it can often be for reasons out of their control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think lowering the GPA [requirement] is going to help students’ well-being and security and retention at UCSB,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoping to build upon the work of former A.S. Senator Zion Solomon, who worked with Vice Chancellor for Students Affairs Margaret Klawunn to reduce the C.A.S.E. fee from $120 to $60, Perez wants to eliminate the fee altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Perez hopes to partner with pre-existing organizations, such as UCSB 4 COLA and the Isla Vista Tenants Union, and support the work they are doing on campus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> particularly through funding from her office, as opposed to creating more branches within the office to do that work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my biggest things is definitely giving back to the community, so sort of uplifting the voices that already exist instead of hijacking organizations, funding movements, offering resources that I know the office has the capacity to,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One criticism Perez pointed out about the work of this year’s S.A.G., Andrew Nguyen, and another issue she hopes to tackle if elected, is the lack of visibility of the OSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this current S.A.G. is doing a disservice to students by not being visible enough and [not] providing students the resources or the information,” she said. Perez hopes to utilize social media — TikTok included — to reach newer students and make them aware of the resources at their disposal, should they ever need them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In comparison to her opponent, Ferguson, Perez did not accomplish as much during her senate term. But ultimately, Ferguson seemed like a candidate who was more focused on the internal aspects of A.S., whereas Perez seemed to focus on reaching outward and impacting more of the student body, which is key to serving as S.A.G.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked why she believed she was the best candidate for the position, Perez recounted a memory from her first year of helping her roommate appeal her academic probation and get her financial aid back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think my experiences inside and outside the university allow me to bring a very unique perspective to this office,” Perez said. “I would hope to be able to provide a safer space for first-gen, low-income students of color to ask for help with the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who has advocated for herself and for those around her for the past few years, Perez is well-suited to advocate for all UCSB students as S.A.G.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: The Nexus has replaced the portraits done of each candidate with their self-submitted headshot.

In the position, she is responsible for sending out weekly agendas, leading meetings when the IVP isn’t present and meeting with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m knowledgeable about how exactly to create an agenda, what goes onto the agenda, how to effectively create it and run the Senate meeting,” White said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen what goes into [being] Internal Vice President and I know what I can do to make it better, to make senators’ Senate time and Senate meetings more effective.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White’s ideas aren’t groundbreaking, but the Nexus chose her because we believe she is the most qualified of the two candidates — based on Senate experience — and is the only candidate with the firm ability to effectively lead weekly Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White’s opponent, fourth-year feminist studies major and current A.S. Senator Racquel Almario, brings extensive experience to the position as the current Finance and Business Committee chair, controlling the Senate’s budget and allotting funds to organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almario has done a substantial amount of work over the year during their senate term as Finance and Business chair, and they are always prepared to explain any budgetary requests to fellow senators when called upon. However, in their interview, Almario failed to elaborate on the details of their plans for the position of IVP and how they intended to execute them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Almario lacked enthusiasm and strong public speaking skills, which we believe are essential to chairing Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A concern of the Nexus</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prior to our endorsement interview was that White would only continue the work started by Adam because of their close working relationship. But White wasn’t afraid to be critical of the ways that Adam didn’t fully measure up. </span></p>\n<p>White pointed out that one problem of Adam’s 70th Senate was poorly attended senator trainings.</p>\n<p>“In the beginning of the year there were supposed to trainings that senators were supposed to complete. I believe we’re supposed to complete seven out of the 14 trainings and a lot of them just did not get done. We had a lot of issues with getting senators to go to the trainings,” White said.</p>\n<p>White said that these required trainings were “not consolidated and it was not as organized as it could be” this past year. She plans to implement a system to begin senators’ trainings during the Declaration of Candidacy (D.O.C.) period of elections instead of after senators are sworn into office.</p>\n<p>“It’s having senators knowledgeable and ready to work from day one, from D.O.C., so that when they do get elected, they can just start doing what they want to do from the moment they win that position, from the moment they’re sworn in, instead of having to wait and having all these confusing trainings in the middle of the fall that people ultimately didn’t end up attending.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change wouldn’t go into effect until the 72nd Senate, as the D.O.C. period is prior to the election, but White said she plans to hold trainings as soon as new senators are elected, so that the 71st Senate can hit the ground running in the fall when students will be back on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate as a whole has often faced problems of transparency, with many students unaware of what senators do on a weekly basis and how the Senate can benefit them, despite the fact that it controls close to $15 million in student fees. Different IVPs have introduced initiatives year-to-year to address the lack of overall visibility, with varying success, and their ability to implement these plans plays a role in their overall success as IVP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White said that, if elected, she would publish weekly informational graphics on social media, listing which resolutions will be discussed that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key plan of White’s is using the Senate unallocated budget, a portion of the Senate’s funds reserved for organizations needing extra funding, to create an emergency fund for students navigating financial burdens due to the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These funds could be used by students to pay rent, break leases or rent storage units, and after the fund’s coronavirus-related needs are over, it would be converted into an A.S. emergency fund, to be used in times of crisis that affect the entire campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this plan, White intends to reach out to the UCSB Alumni Association to create an endowment and also wants to connect with potential donors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White did not fully answer how her plan is different from the work already being done by the Financial Crisis Response Team (FCRT), which is designed to help students financially in situations like the coronavirus or the 2017 Thomas Fire. When asked to clarify, she said she believes the organization’s work is only on an individual basis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a red flag that White lacked a deep understanding about the FCRT, which would be crucial to implementing what is her top platform point. But the IVP, more so than any other executive position, is more focused on internal operations than directly impacting students through new initiatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both White and Almario were senators this year, each with leading roles within the senate, as first pro-tempore and Finance and Business Committee chair, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the term, Almario authored four resolutions, compared to White’s 17. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, this was a decision not made lightly by the Nexus, as Almario brings extensive A.S. experience and some great platform points to the table. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almario said that, if elected, they plan to move required trainings online, helping to ensure that all senators are trained while not requiring scheduled appointments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almario also wants to create a senate bill tracker, which is far more comprehensive in ensuring accountability compared to White’s weekly update plan. We would hope that White would implement some of these initiatives if elected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the Nexus believes that White has the ability to lead a unified Senate, not two separate parties refusing to work across the aisle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White is not a perfect candidate, but Almario’s interview made clear that they did not have the same ability to control the Senate room, which, in the end, is paramount to the success of the IVP. The IVP needs to be a force of leadership, someone who is not afraid to stand up and keep people in line.

Senate. It seems Solomon has a resolution on the table nearly every week, if not every other week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir drafted three resolutions during her entire term as a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon cited their primary reason for running is because they genuinely wanted to help students, and because, having been engaged in so many spaces on campus, they understand what students need. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon firmly believes in the term “trickle-up social justice,” which they explained as helping the most marginalized, vulnerable people on campus: “the people who have their voices silenced the most.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Solomon’s resume sprawls all over campus – they have worked in Ortega Dining Commons, the Davidson Library, the UCen Bookstore, the A.S. Cashiers and Ticket Office and beyond. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, their most prominent role came in being the A.S. Finance and Business Chair, during which they kept track of nearly $15 million dollars in student fees while also holding an unwavering commitment to transparency through weekly graphics that showed students exactly where student fees go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has also reached outside of the senatorial role to organize the Trans Joy Take Over, a survivor solidarity event, and worked hard to promote the A.S. Book Bank in order to help students who may otherwise not be able to afford textbooks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve seen so many aspects of student life, I feel like that makes me very equipped and qualified,” they said in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kept telling students this year, this is your money. A.S. needs to be less of an elitist thing, it takes work from people within it to share with people out of it and people who don’t know very much about it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their proudest moment as senator came when they drafted a resolution supporting the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\">Black Student Union Demands</a> and were able to see the tangible change being made for Black students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a senatorial candidate in Spring Quarter 2018, Solomon centered their platform on mental health education, pushing for decreased wait times at Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this goal was not nearly unique at the time, Solomon won the most “first” votes out of any other on-campus senator during the Spring Quarter 2018 elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have further solidified relationships with UCSB administration, working with Vice Chancellor for Students Affairs Margaret Klawunn to lower the fee waiver for students who have been charged in the College Alcohol and Substance Education (C.A.S.E.) program, as well as supporting former A.S. Advisor LaDonte King’s legacy by creating the “King’s A+ For Excellence”  scholarship in his name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon said they had to work hard to get that fee lowered. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really had to show them that I’m not just a student who enjoys drinking and wants people to not get charged for that. It’s a serious issue… students were put in really bad financial situations because of the C.A.S.E. fee and sometimes it was just because they were caught with alcohol in a dorm or just very minor things when the real issue is actually binge drinking.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon also has a self-described “working relationship” with the Office of Financial Aid, putting on workshops with them and becoming familiar with the department’s director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They further spoke to their attendance of conferences, noting they have a “really good network” at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. They have learned from those campuses and their student governments with the aim of making UC Santa Barbara’s A.S. better. </span></p>\n<p><b>GOALS IF ELECTED: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It appears Solomon has not forgotten the C.A.P.S. goal that they ran on as a senatorial candidate, as Solomon noted in their interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that, if elected, they want to continue to push for more funding for C.A.P.S., along with a dozen other agenda items, which include: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting the Black Student Union Demands;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working to make textbooks more affordable; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating UC-wide coalitions between student activists and student leaders; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pushing the UC President, Janet Napolitano, to make sure students’ voices are heard; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a peer mentor program with the Office of the President, in which students would be more informed about their financial aid and advising options;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing to put out surveys to gauge students’ needs;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding the A.S. Book Bank; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a “legitimate” test bank so students can share notes, which Solomon believes will help with retention rates; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating an academic excellence initiative to create part-time jobs through the expansion of the book bank;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a program called Gaucho Career, which is a career development program that would help students get a headstart on a future career;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redesigning the A.S. website so it is more interactive; </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding the A.S. fellowship;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with the Alumni Association to develop a mentorship program that would connect successful alumni and students;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving beyond just the A.S. Senate’s live stream and live streaming meetings with all administration officials to make them more accessible;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a lock-in fee that would support the cost of gender reassignment surgery, creating a grant similar to the ones given out by the Educational Opportunity Program; </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir is running on a platform of making college more affordable by lobbying legislators, introducing an app that would contain a list of all A.S. resources, purchasing a subscription to Headspace – a guided meditation app – for every student using A.S. monies and putting a vending machine in I.V. that would provide free meals to students with financial need and undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has been working on the latter project during her “gap year” between senate and her candidacy. </span></p>\n<p><b>OUR CONCERNS:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acknowledges Solomon has a tendency to lean away from impartiality: a few weeks ago, they went as far as to call the other party “Colonizers United” in a tweet on their Twitter page, which was public at the time. We were disappointed when Solomon did not fully respond to our question about the tweet and a question about a judicial council case they were involved in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They did, however, admit that the tweet was a “momentary lapse” in judgement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Solomon said they would not use their private social media accounts for A.S. and political business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second point of concern with Solomon’s candidacy – and one that gave the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pause when discussing endorsements – was the fact that they deceived the student body during Fall Quarter 2018 by not living amongst their constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During their interview with the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Solomon admitted to living off campus during Fall Quarter 2018, a possible violation of their term as an on-campus senator – an offense that fellow On-Campus Senator Yasamin Salari was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-26/judicial-council-unanimously-votes-to-remove-a-s-senator-salari/\">removed from her position for</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They spoke candidly about their situation, citing financial struggles as the reason. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the beginning of the year and throughout the summer, I could not afford to live anywhere. So I didn’t have a lease… anywhere fall quarter,” Solomon said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon added that they did tell Internal Vice President Steven Ho about the situation; however, the fact remains that their constituents did not know. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was living with a friend until I could afford to pay for winter and spring [quarters]. And I’m in a pretty bad place financially. I was trying to save up money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon said the reason they didn’t speak about the issue publicly at the time is because they did not want “the additional burden” that came with the publicity that Salari had experienced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> acknowledges that Solomon’s deception was troubling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, given Solomon’s ability to be candid and open with us now, combined with the financial hardships that they had faced, we do not believe this should affect the student body’s decision on who to choose as the president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nexus’ </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specific concerns, we fully recognize Solomon’s cracks as a candidate are far and few compared to their successes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon has created change in every corner of this campus. Even those not involved in A.S. circles – which are admittedly rather insulated – know Solomon as someone who has accomplished a lot in their short time at UCSB, a fact the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found as we were deciding who to endorse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solomon is a current second year, and while we realize that having a third-year A.S. president is a bit unorthodox, they appear to be naturally suited for the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are open about their struggles and their qualifications, and aren’t afraid to take on the realities of the job – they noted that their identity as a queer, Black person helps them to understand the struggle of all students, particularly marginalized ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their interview, Solomon put it aptly: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most marginalized people [on campus] experience all the bugs in a system, like all the things going wrong with the association or the university… We’re able to feel it the most and then we’re able to advocate for them and make this university better in a way that benefits every single student on this campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As echoed before, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">believes that either Solomon or Sir would serve the school well;

She started off as a fellow her first year, went on to work as the community organizing director and is currently the legislative director in the office.</p>\n<p>She knows the EVPSA office inside out — she knows how to get things done and exactly who to work with to make things happen.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has spent the last three years working behind the scenes, and it’s time for her to be in the spotlight.</p>\n<p>“I think the EVPSA is a very unique position in which it’s not something that you can just come into and know what you’re doing,” Leal Silva said. “There are so many institutions that you’re navigating, so many relationships that have to be formed. Frankly, they get the work done and I think I’ve really put in the groundwork to allow myself to do that work.”</p>\n<p>“I know what a successful office looks like versus one that needs more work. I have worked in every single office that has existed on this campus for the past three years.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has ample experience working with Associated Students (A.S.) Lobby Corps; this past year, she has been working on Senate Bill 24, a bill which would ensure abortion by medication access on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Last year, Leal Silva helped create Coffee and Calls, which provided students with the opportunity to call their senators about certain legislation while having a free cup of coffee in the Arbor.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> asked Leal Silva why she decided to stay working behind the scenes for so long, and her answer further confirmed that she is now ready to take on the position.</p>\n<p>“I am a big believer in taking space and leaving space and knowing when to step up and knowing when to take a step back and just do the work,” Leal Silva said. “I’m not ashamed to admit that I wouldn’t have been able to serve our students as well last year.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva made it clear that she will not be affected by any of the drama or toxicity that comes with party politics in A.S.</p>\n<p>“The EVPSA office is such a unique space. It’s one space that, personally, I’ve never seen become enthralled with the drama that sometimes can enthrall A.S.,” she said. “It’s not the sense of superiority or like ‘we’re above it,’ but it’s this sense of knowing… we’re working for something so big, we’re working for ideas that seem so unattainable.”</p>\n<p>“There isn’t time to get caught up in all of it.”</p>\n<p>For the first two years of Leal Silva working in the EVPSA office, the office was “CU-controlled.”</p>\n<p>“For me, it comes down to: Are you down to do the work?” Leal Silva said.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day, the boy living on Picasso, the girl living on Sabado… they don’t care about your business. They don’t care about your drama, they just care about how you’re doing work that helps them.”</p>\n<p>If elected, Leal Silva hopes to focus on expanding financial aid and focus specifically on advocating for the Middle Class Scholarship.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also wants to focus on deferred maintenance funding.</p>\n<p>“We need to talk about how Girvetz is in shambles, but we have brand new bioengineering buildings,” Leal Silva said. “Our students should feel like they all have access to this equal level of education and that they’re not being left behind because of their major.”</p>\n<p>“Newsom asks that we add a thousand more students to the UC system. How could we possibly accommodate for those students if we can’t accommodate for the ones we already have?”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva’s maturity and sense of responsibility are two qualities necessary for the EVPSA position, but more than anything, Leal Silva sold the <em>Nexus</em> on her pure passion for the work she does and the goals she has for UCSB if elected into the position.</p>\n<p>“I want UCSB to be a leader of force when it comes to these issues. I want them to think of our campus as an indispensable area of innovation and of creativity and community. I think that we already have it and I think we can do more of it, and I would love to help lead us to that next step.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also referenced the Finance and Business Committee budget reports that On-Campus Senator Zion Solomon has been creating, stating she wants to take similar steps in order to be transparent with the amount of money spent on lobbying trips.</p>\n<p>“I’m very aware that the EVPSA has one of the biggest budgets in A.S. because they do work that needs, frankly, more money,” Leal Silva said. “But being intentional and being like ‘just so you know, this is what we’re doing with the [money]’… can really, I think, strengthen that bond of trust between the student body and the office.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">“That’s what allyship is… It’s using your privilege to say, ‘I’m going to step aside and give you my stage for however long you need it to get your point across.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of what the EVPSA office has done to increase transparency during the time Leal Silva has worked in it, Leal Silva said she believes the social media presence of the office has grown over the last three years in order to keep students in the loop, and she hopes the office’s social media presence will continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also showed that she knows exactly who to work with within A.S. for the projects she wants to take on.</p>\n<p>She talked about funding to address food insecurity in I.V., and said she would work with the Executive Vice President for Local Affairs and the A.S. Food Bank. She discussed addressing the holes in Title IX policy, and said she would work with C.A.R.E. and Take Back the Night. Leal Silva also mentioned working with the Human Rights Board to advocate for gun violence legislation.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva is also knowledgeable about UCSB’s role in the United States Students Association (USSA) and the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<p>“UCSB pays the most dues to the UCSA, which means that when we’re talking about issues, they need to listen to our campus because we’re paying the most money.”</p>\n<p>“I think the money that we do put forth is doing tangible good. It is doing really great things in terms of supporting the undocumented community, in terms of supporting sustainable programs, and in terms of funding the UC,” she added. “As EVPSA, I want to make sure that those benefits are being felt on our campus.”</p>\n<p>This past year, Leal Silva has been serving on the Government Relations Committee of UCSA, which includes the legislative directors of other UCs; Leal Silva has effectively built connections with other UC EVPSA offices already.</p>\n<p>“I’ve learned a lot from listening to how Berkeley runs their office, to San Diego, to Santa Cruz, and they all have such critical ways of approaching these issues,” Leal Silva said. “I almost don’t want to compare them because I don’t want the space to feel like a race or like a competition.</p>\n<p>“It very much so should exist as a collaborative space where you’re learning from each other.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also seems committed to doing whatever it takes to help marginalized students on campus and added that she wants to continue to advocate for UCSA’s Undocumented Student’s Lobby Day.</p>\n<p>“That’s what allyship is… It’s using your privilege to say, ‘I’m going to step aside and give you my stage for however long you need it to get your point across.’”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva also believes that it wouldn’t be her constituents’ jobs to come to her, but instead, it would be her job to go to them.</p>\n<p>“If you want to know what’s affecting students in the [Muslim Student Association], you have to go to an MSA meeting and sit down and listen. You want to understand what’s affecting students in Indus or MEChA or even CLAS.… go to CLAS and ask the tutors ‘what are you witnessing?’”</p>\n<p>“Go to a C.A.P.S. psychologist [and ask] ‘What services would help you do your job better?’ It’s all very worth it if you want to understand where students are at.”</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> does believe that Beasley is a capable leader. He is the director of internal affairs for the Coalition for a Better UC (CBUC), and he spoke to the work he has done on one of the CBUC’s goals to expand the Cal Grant.</p>\n<p>Beasley has refreshing ideas. He wants to help stop the UC from doing business with corporations that profit off of prison labor and support formerly incarcerated young adults who apply to UCSB, along with his more common platform point of decreasing the burden of tuition for UC students.</p>\n<p>When asked why he decided to run this year, Beasley said, “I figured it was, you know, prime time because I’ll be going into my third year. I don’t want to do it while I’d be studying abroad my senior year.”</p>\n<p>“I figured if I were to run this quarter, then my term would start while we were still doing the hearings for the bill, so I’d be able to use the resources from the office to be able to try to push this bill and push student issues as a whole.”</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus</em> admires Beasley’s work on the Summer Cal Grant bill, we are concerned that this one bill will end up being his primary focus.</p>\n<p>“I know that he has done a lot of work regarding Cal Grants and financial aid,” Leal Silva said when asked about her opponent.</p>\n<p>“There is a lot to be considered and it can’t be just that.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva added that she’s had the “privilege of working with him and working with his group on the Cal Grant,” and that she believes he is doing “incredible work.”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva said that Beasley is “an example of what student leadership is and of what boots-on-the-ground work is,” and she wants to continue to collaborate with Beasley.</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has the broad knowledge of issues that are required of the EVPSA to know about, and we do not believe that Beasley has the insight or experience that Leal Silva has.</p>\n<p>When Leal Silva was a first year at UCSB, she applied to a lobbying trip and did not get in. Leal Silva spoke to how disappointed she felt, and she mentioned how the legislative director in the EVPSA office at the time told her that she had to make herself “indispensable” on this campus.</p>\n<p>“[He said] ‘you need to be one of the people that if we’re talking about Title IX, or if we’re talking about financial aid, we think of you automatically as someone we need to have on our team.’”</p>\n<p>Leal Silva has done just that — she has become indispensable on this campus.</p>\n<p>“We have so much potential,” Leal Silva said toward the end of her interview. “If chosen to serve, I would give it everything I had and more.”</p>\n<p>We believe her.</p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus<em> Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87560\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87560\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/alexandra-leal-silva-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/","id":2090,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2089,2088,2087],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Alli Adam for Internal Vice President","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-04-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/allia_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-8.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/allia_Max-Abrams_ONLINE-8.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Daily Nexus endorses Alli Adam to be the 2019-2020 internal vice president of the 70th A.S.

Senate was led by IVP Steven Ho. Although Ho did make an effort to keep his Senate under tabs, multiple instances of disorder showcased in Senate meetings were ultimately left unmediated by Ho, who is responsible for being both diplomatic and bipartisan in the position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> believes Alli Adam will better equipped to handle unruly situations and facilitate Senate meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Adam served as a Letters and Sciences senator where she learned that the common goal of A.S. – to help the student body as a whole – often gets lost in “pettiness on the Senate floor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to run for internal vice president to access the full potential and legitimacy that the Senate could have,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam plans to crack down on the use of technology during public forum, which is an area that she believes Ho did not spend enough effort to enforce. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam finds the current penalty for technology use, docking honoraria, to be ineffective, noting that most senators breach the policy and use technology anyways. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To remediate this problem, Adam plans to have senators “put their phone next to their name tags,” where they will be much more visible to the public, other senators and the IVP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam proposed this idea because she finds that senators “aren’t as attentive” as they should be, despite the importance of public forum, when “members of our community and our campus come to talk to who they believe is to be representing them and responsive to their needs and responsive to their concerns.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further uphold a healthy environment at Senate meetings, Adam said she will have “no problem kicking people out of public forum if they are inappropriate… I can’t have my senators feeling like they’re unsafe when somebody’s coming in for public forums.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When questioned about her qualifications for the position, Adam cited her experience in mock trial, public speaking, her work in the office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs, an internship at the Alumni Association  and her work in Senate this past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Adam’s public forum resolution didn’t “pan out” the way she wanted it to, she stands behind it because it provides students a concrete and guaranteed time to speak at public forum. The resolution was created in order to hold public forum at a set time, before the “new business” section of the Senate agenda. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of her resolution, Adam also provided students with a “campus-wide school supply drive,” where she was “able to save the time and money of over 500 students during Week One.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of personal qualities, Adam said she will take advantage of her assertiveness and confidence to help keep order and set precedent at Senate meetings.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m confident and unafraid to have order in the Senate room because I think the lack of order and the lack of control has let us senators think we can do whatever we want,” Adam said. “We all need to be on the same page and we all need to have a consistent behavior so that we’re cohesive and we’re productive.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when asked about an instance where she was able to display her assertiveness, Adam was not able to list any tangible examples, citing the “toxic” and “disheartening” atmosphere at Senate meetings where she felt “honest opinions aren’t valued.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a larger scale, the role of IVP requires whoever is filling the seat to remain neutral, unbiased and bipartisan. Adam has run with Campus United, one of the two A.S parties, for both her Senate and executive campaigns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When questioned about her bipartisanship, Adam pledged that, even in the event all other executives are members of the Isla Vista Party, “I am 100% committed to being a neutral and unbiased IVP.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes that “drive” and “determination” are much stronger metrics of qualification than party affiliation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam believes working with other executives is “about setting clear goals and clear standards so that we can refer back to them when things do get tricky.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked to critique the current IVP, Adam cited multiple grievances with Ho throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam is chiefly concerned with the timeliness of training, which educates incoming senators on the various parts of A.S. According to Adam, no formal training occurred until Winter Quarter, two quarters after elections concluded. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of felt like our first half of Senate was whether or not you had an in with Steven and you could be his friend enough to get the information,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honoraria, another aspect that Adam holds frustration with, failed to be distributed in a timely manner this year. Honoraria is sometimes used for “basic needs,” according to Adam, when students rely on its timeliness to make payments. To combat this, Adam pledges to ensure that honoraria will be paid on time at the end of each quarter, as well as to post honoraria links so necessary BCUs (Boards, Committees and Units) can receive their funding as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam’s final grievance with Ho’s tenure rests in his oversight of the Senate as a whole. Adam said Ho let senators “run amok” during Senate meetings, which hindered the Senate’s ability to have productive meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho’s poor control of Senate resulted in “a lack of change being made for students,” Adam said, as well as “a lack of legislation because certain senators feel like if they introduce something, it’s going to be like verbally scoffed at.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Adam is working with another senator, Melissa Perez, to create an alternative method for members of A.S. to interact with students, as she finds that the default settings of Senate meetings are often “toxic” and “intense,” which can deter students from sharing their ideas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whether it’s on FaceTime, whether it’s an anonymous email or an anonymous comment, we’re going to have a list that we want to get back out to the students so that they know how they can still contact us if they don’t feel comfortable in the room,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also room for improvement in how senators manage BCUs. Adam feels that senators need to do a better job listening to BCUs needs, as it is a senator’s job to be a liaison between their respective BCU and the Senate itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Adam suggested that she will ask future senators to “personalize” relationships with their respective BCU, so they can better tune in to each BCU’s specific need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For me, it comes down to personalizing and, as a senator, how you’re going to work with your BCU,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To maintain transparency within the Senate, Adam proposed the idea of holding one-on-one meetings with each senator every quarter. By doing so, the meetings will allow her to maintain “a clear line of communication” among the entire Senate and help answer any questions senators have by pointing them in the right direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At every Senate meeting, there is an allocated spot on the agenda for specific on-campus organizations to deliver an update. However, there is almost never a physical presence. Adam plans to “hunt down” these representatives because hearing from them “really helps senators know what those spaces are up to,” as well as “build trust in senators so they can go and collaborate with those people on certain issues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next year, if elected, Adam would like to have more oversight of Finance and Business, the IVP’s administrative committee and have a Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.)  counselor present at every Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam also expressed her frustration in the lack of resources for students to store their belongings at the end of Spring Quarter. Currently, students can take their belongings home, pay a fee to keep it in a storage locker or move into their new residence two weeks after finals end. Adam would like to create an interim storage solution to allow students to store their belongings as they shift between leases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Adam would also like to incorporate more funding to “prioritize mental health” without raising student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Adam has not demonstrated as much tangible change in Senate as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">would like to see. But we do believe that, coupled with her ideas to improve the role of IVP, her work outside of Senate and her drive to make A.S. a better entity, Adam is an effective, bipartisan and diplomatic candidate for the role of internal vice president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, we believe she has the maturity and confidence to facilitate Wednesday night A.S. Senate meetings effectively. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Daily Nexus Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team. </span></i></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-87556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that is not to say that Griffin’s endorsement is a complete stamp of approval: both candidates had significant advantages and weaknesses that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> took into consideration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Griffin received the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> endorsement because of the work he has done, the familiarity he has with local government bodies and officials as well as his platform, which had more concrete ideas that could go a long way for the community if implemented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin runs for this position after having worked in the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) office since his freshman year, when he applied for the fellowship program within the office. That year, Griffin worked with then EVPLA Ashcon Minoiefar to find homes for students who were displaced due to a balcony collapse in a home on Del Playa Drive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That same year, Griffin also served as the treasurer for Hall Council in Santa Cruz Hall. Griffin noted in his interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Santa Cruz Hall was the only residence hall that year to not ask for additional funds from Residential Housing Association at the end of the year. He cited this as evidence of his fiscal responsibility, which he said he would apply to the EVPLA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that it’s important that people who are in those positions are responsible with student fees. And that’s an example of me being responsible as student fees,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following year, Griffin served as the I.V. liaison for the office and began working with different groups in I.V. and familiarizing himself with the arena of local politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, Griffin studied abroad in Fall Quarter. When he came back to UCSB, he did not serve in an Associated Students role on campus, but was involved with the Beloved Community Conference Committee and served as president of the UC Santa Barbara chapter of The One Campaign, an international organization taking action against poverty and preventable disease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, for his senior year, Griffin believes it is the right time for him to step into the position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I thought that I would come back [from studying abroad] and do what I’ve always wanted to do and be the EVPLA,” Griffin said. “Or at least give myself the chance to run and share my story with students and share why I think I would be the best candidate to represent students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for his platform, Griffin has already made efforts to ensure the feasibility and completion of some of his projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin discussed the possibility of a community court in I.V. with local representatives Joan Hartmann and District Attorney Joyce Dudley, who he said were in favor of implementing the plan in the next year. The court would allow I.V. residents to attend hearings for minor infractions, such as underage drinking and parking violations, at a location in I.V. rather than at the courthouse in downtown Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the circumstances of many students in I.V., such as busy schedules and a lack of transportation, the option to attend hearings locally would lift a weight off students’ shoulders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most [students] don’t have cars and yes, there is a bus that goes down there, but most of these court dates are Friday at 8:00 a.m. and sometimes the buses are too full or sometimes [students] can’t get to the bus on time,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is also aiming for a project that has long been an unfulfilled aspect of previous EVPLA platforms: free wifi in parks and beaches in I.V. Although the project has failed to gain footing in the past, Griffin believes completing the project is just a matter of “laying the groundwork.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s a project that can’t be completed in nine months. It can be started in nine months, but then there’s lack of continuity in that transition. So I think that now, given the fact that we have structured government in Isla Vista… pushing for it and continuing to lay the groundwork for [the parks] can have it go throughout the next few years,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address food insecurity, Griffin wants to create a food bank in I.V. by collaborating with local grocery stores to give away the food those stores don’t sell. Griffin said after meeting with someone from the I.V. Food Co-op, he believes stores would be willing to donate food that is close to expiring so that students can access it for free at a designated location in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite his thorough platform ideas, which the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> believes will benefit students if they are seen through, Griffin still seems to be slightly out of touch with student issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Griffin must ensure that groups which he cannot speak for are able and encouraged to speak and express their own concerns, grievances and hopes for the community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I cannot speak on behalf of all communities and identities in Isla Vista and UCSB’s campus, but I really like marketing Associated Students and I think that if the EVPLA Office and A.S. as a whole can work to market our services and market what we do as an entity, I think that that gives a little bit more outreach to those communities,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible for Griffin to amplify these voices in his office, but it will be up to him to provide that opportunity.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also failed to adequately address sexual assault, violence and harassment in his platform and interview. As something that has consistent advocacy from student organizations, UCSB’s Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education Center and I.V.’s local governments, sexual violence in I.V. and at UCSB is an issue that needs to be on the EVPLA’s radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When discussing police presence in I.V., another contested issue in the community, Griffin again seemed to lack the perspective that some students hold about feeling unsafe with police. Griffin said he wants to “bridge the gap” between students and police, namely by holding public forums to foster discussions between the two and “really working to give more of a backstory of the police officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had concerns that Griffin somewhat overlooked the serious worries of students who do not feel safe around police officers. Griffin offered some ideas to address the issue, but seemed to think that issue could be solved if students “understand who [police officers] are in general.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, in comparison with Ornelas, Griffin lacked the same charisma and confidence that his opponent displayed. Student leaders –– all leaders –– need to be able to inspire hope, assurance and trust in their constituents. Neither EVPLA candidates completely achieved this, but Ornelas’ personable character is an advantage he has over Griffin.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If elected, Griffin will need to keep these concerns at the forefront of his agenda as EVPLA and if he does, there is potential for a successful EVPLA term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, neither candidate perfectly embodies the ideal candidate for this position.

It has been shortened and lightly edited for clarity:</p>\n<p><strong>What is your name, year and major?</strong><br>\nI am a second year English major and history minor.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are you running for S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI didn’t anticipate running for an exec position…. I thought that because I served as a senator as an off-campus Senator this year, I would retire after this year, but I figured I still had some gas in the tank and there was still a lot of work left to be done in our community. I figured it would almost be like a sell out move to just retire a little bit earlier than ahead of time.</p>\n<p><strong>What party did you run with as senator? Do you think parties should exist?</strong><br>\nIf you asked me a couple of months ago, I would say [parties] would be completely unnecessary. Now, looking back [on this] year as a whole, I think parties offer some value. I think it’s kept other senators accountable because there is this sense of competitiveness. But as a whole, I think [it has caused] a lot more friction in the organization then it needs to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Because you were involved in Campus United, are you worried that people might not think that you’re independent if you do get the position?</strong><br>\nI’m going to try to brand myself as completely unaffiliated as much as I can. But of course, no matter what you say or how much you do, there’s still people who will cast you one way or another…</p>\n<p>I thrive best in one-on-one situations, on individual scenarios, right. So even in the Senate room, I’ve tried throughout the entire year to cross the aisle per se. I love working with IVP senators. I try to cooperate and collaborate them as much as I can.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you involved with on campus that you believe makes you qualified for S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI worked for the annual fund and as student ambassadors. So even working with a bunch of those people, you’re talking to all different parts of the campus. Other than that I’m also in the Zeta Psi fraternity. So I’m involved in the Greek community, which constitutes about 10% of our campus. [I am also in] mock trial. I did [mock trial] my freshman year and I still serve as a student coach. And so all of those organizations I think touches on these different corners of our campus. Honestly, I’m just one person and I’d love to be involved as much as I can, but I can’t [be involved in everything].</p>\n<p><strong>You are involved in Greek Life. You will most likely be dealing with a lot of cases and maybe even some against members of Greek Life. Do you feel there’s any sort of conflict of interest here, and what can you do to ease the concerns of the students on campus who don’t feel safe around Greek Life?</strong><br>\nI think my involvement in the Greek Life community actually offered me a really unique perspective. I think I could actually approach those sort of cases with less prejudice because it’s well known that there’s a stigma around a Greek life. Right? And I think that’s where a lot of biases against people that comes about. But having been in Greek life myself, I can see that there are really awesome people in Greek life. I met some of the best people I’ve ever met in my life [in Greek life]. I think [being in Greek life] allows me to approach these sort of cases, along with other communities I’m involved in, in a way that is a more compassionate than someone that isn’t.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important aspect of being S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI think making the resources [that are] more accessible. I know a large part of the job is to represent the students interests in terms of disciplinary action. That was definitely a large part of the job. But for me and going into this election season, I really want to emphasize my passion for making a lot of the resources on campus more accessible, [because] at least from my experience, a large part of these resources exist in the first place is because it became clear that a lot of students need things like the Food Bank, but [some students] don’t know that these resources exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific projects that you’re interested in working on while S.A.G.?</strong><br>\nI was talking to Jack Tannenbaum [Editor’s Note: Tannenbaum was the 2017-2018 S.A.G.] who was working on [a poll project] throughout the entire year. It was to collect data from the student body, especially from people who aren’t involved in A.S. through the outreach.</p>\n<p>I would love to take on that project, but to build upon it. Tabling, going door to door and through basic face interactions to get students actually really thinking about this thing critically. So [I want to] collect that data and then bring it to the Senate and then say, ‘That this is what the student prioritize.’ I think that is the best way to first determine what the students want. And then from there working with my team to figure out how to make those resources more visible. I can’t do this [alone] obviously. But to work with the cabinet, along with the 24 senators that are about to get elected, I think we do some real damage.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you look for in hiring caseworkers, in members of your office? What are some qualities you’d look for?</strong><br>\nThis is arguably thing I thought about most… I’m really looking forward [to working with a team] and my team will have eagerness and a passion for [the office]. I’m looking for people who will approach these cases with a sense of humanity and compassion that I think the OSA requires a level of empathy that I think students deserve. So that’s the thing I’m really looking for, goodhearted people who care, but [also] have this really special level of compassion for others.</p>\n<p><strong>Example: Say there is an incident where someone says that you are not doing your job correctly. How would you respond to that?</strong><br>\nListen to them, for starters. I think from my experience as a senator and [from] my leadership experience in high school, it’s much harder to sit down and listen to what someone has to say to you, especially when it’s not convenient. So that’s the first thing I’d do. I would listen and see where they’re coming from and then work with them to see how we can better.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have experience working with people in the administration? People like Katya Armistead, Margaret Klawunn, etc.?</strong><br>\nNo, I don’t actually. So a lot of this will be new and a lot of it is very daunting. But the team that I’m hoping to create, I am looking for people who were experienced in working with those sorts of figures. So, I mean, a lot of what you just said seemed daunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you’re prepared for this position?</strong><br>\nI mean, I’m here right now. I think so. I’m hopeful more than I am [prepared]. I am frightened, but I am a human being, so a lot of nights I do stay up thinking about it to see if I’m ready. But I think a large part of me, like I said, is really excited, but [there is] that part that is scared. I think I even find value in that.</p>\n<p>I think it means I’m not stupid. I am trying to be really delicate and really critical about the things I say. I understand the gravity of this position.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you uphold that confidentiality?</strong><br>\nI think the major thing is to emphasize [confidentiality] with my case workers because they’re the ones that are also seeing the case. And for me personally, I’ve dealt with confidentiality. Just being a senator, we have to uphold confidentiality with, especially with Title IX reports.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think can be most improved around campus?</strong><br>\nI think the major thing I’m focused on is the visibility and access to resources. [Hearing] from my friends and my constituents as the senator right now, people just don’t know they exist. That would be the thing that would be most improved. Like I said, just highlighting those sort of resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal Code states that the S.A.G. is expected to “Educate the student body about student’s rights, University and Associated Students policies, laws, regulations, procedures, and promote awareness of the availability of support and assistance services offered both by the OSA, Associated Students, and the University at large.” How would you go about doing that?</strong><br>\nYeah, so I know workshops are also very good way to go about that. I think a lot of students are interested in the rights that they have. I think once I have been making myself visible and I have a good amount of influence on the community at large, I think pushing these workshops that educate people on their student rights [would] be really helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think your personal identity intersects with your professional duty to represent students, especially those of historically underrepresented communities? How do you think your identity will play a role in your position as S.A.G. if elected?</strong><br>\nWell, I’m a second generation American. My parents migrated over to America in 1979 and so growing up, I have definitely been somebody who has experienced and been exposed to a lot of <em>microaggressions.</em> Absolutely. But to say that I have been largely marginalized and I think would be to invalidate the narratives of so many other people. I don’t plan on casting myself as someone by a marginalized narrative, but I do have a sense of what that feels to be a second generation American.</p>\n<p><strong>How would you go about choosing your team?</strong><br>\nSo I would send out an application. An online application that asks what organizations they’re part of. That’s major, that very basic stuff. Right. And then once they come to interview, I kind of have to ask them, um, [a lot of] sorts of questions. Quite honestly, [I want] just to see different personalities in work.</p>\n<p><em>The </em>Daily Nexus<em> Editorial Board is comprised of the editor in chief and the news team</em>.</p>\n<p><i>Correction [11:10 p.m.]: Nguyen said he originally thought A.S. political parties were “unnecessary,” not “necessary.” This article has been updated to reflect that. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-87562\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-87562\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/student-advocate-general-no-endorsement/","id":2088,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2087,2086,2085],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ask Me Anything: Questions About A.S.

Senate resolutions actually affect university policy?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no direct percentage of Senate resolutions that affect university policy. There are several different types of bills/resolutions that the Senate passes, but the main two are positional and directional resolutions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positional bill/resolution is one that “endorses, sponsors, or supports a group’s actions or events.” Positional resolutions require a two thirds vote. For example, a positional resolution passed this past year was one in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-17/a-s-passes-three-resolutions-in-support-of-afscme-strike-one-which-suspends-a-s-operations-in-solidarity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support of the AFSCME strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A directional bill/resolution is one that “directs members of A.S. Personnel, Boards, Committees and/or the Senate to specific duties.” A directional resolution requires a 50% plus 1 vote – in the case of the 69th Senate, 13 votes. One example of a directional resolution passed by the Senate during this past year is “The King’s A+ For Excellence Awards,” </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/new-resolution-keeps-former-a-s-advisor-kings-legacy-alive/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which awards five students each a $500 grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further details about the types of bills and resolutions that the Senate can pass begins on page 313 of Legal Code under the Policy 6: Main Motions section in the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>Where do my student fees go?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of the 2018-2019 school year, students pay $631.83 in A.S. and Graduate Student Association (GSA) fees and $1,188.87 in lock-in fees – overall, paying $1,820.70 in student fees each school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student fees given to A.S. fund Arts &amp; Lectures, the Child Care Center, Campus Learning Assistive Services (C.L.A.S.), Disabled Student Services, the Events Center, intramural sports, the Multi-Cultural Center, the Office of Student Life, Recreational Sports, the Coastal Fund, Student Health and the University Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students fees designated as lock-in fees include Arts &amp; Lectures, bike path maintenance, a second C.L.A.S. fee, Career Services, C.A.P.S., E.O.P., Event Center, the Green Initiative</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fund (TGIF)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Health &amp; Wellness, a second MCC fee, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the Recreation Center among others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some fees fall under both of these categories, such as two separate MCC fees and two C.L.A.S. fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact breakdown of fees for the 2018-2019 school year can be found <a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/2018-19cbf.pdf?sfvrsn=6518aa46_2\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>How were both parties founded?

The Isla Vista Party was founded in Feb. 2017 and </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-15/new-party-emerges-for-a-s-elections/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ran candidates for the first time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Spring Quarter 2017 Elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time the Open People’s Party (OPP) ran candidates in an election was in </span><a href=\"https://elections.as.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spring-2015.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter 2015.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported in 2016 that many former OPP members “now identify with the new groups.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last time the Democratic Process Party (DP) ran candidates was in </span><a href=\"https://elections.as.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Spring-2014-Election-Results.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring Quarter 2014</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cannot speak to the rivalry between the two. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do the candidates plan to lower student fees?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, only one candidate – presidential candidate Alison Sir – has said she wanted to lower student fees. The other presidential candidate, Zion Solomon, said during the presidential candidate forum that they would like to keep student fees the same, emphasizing the importance of the fees for creating programs that benefit students. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is the minimum voting percentage threshold needed to win if a candidate is unopposed?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated in A.S. Legal Code, at least 20% of all eligible undergraduate students must vote in the election for it to be valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For individual candidates, Elections Board uses the Droop Quota to calculate the minimum number of voters needed for a candidate to be elected. The formula is as follows: Votes Needed = (Valid Votes Cast / Number of Seats + 1) + 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further information about the quota can be found on page 298 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p><b>What is a special election? Is this a special election?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not a special election. A special election can happen when a position within the executive offices – such as the president, EVPLA, EVPSA, IVP or S.A.G. – becomes vacant. Special election rules are controlled by Elections Board. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This past year, there have been two special elections: the first in Fall Quarter 2018 and the second in Winter Quarter 2019. Both elections attempted to fulfill the vacant EVPSA position; during both, less than the minimum required number of students voted, invaliding the results. </span></p>\n<p><b>Who is advising elections? Who are members of the committee in charge of elections? Do we get to see the minutes?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students Elections Board is in charge of the elections. There are seven members of the board, and they are advised by Kendra Sandoval and Ruth Garcia Guevara. Election Board minutes are not open to the public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are on Elections Board cannot run for any senatorial or executive position or be a representative for any campus political party. </span></p>\n<p><b>Is results night still in the UCen?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. Results night will happen in the UCen’s Hub at 7 p.m. on Thursday, April 25. </span></p>\n<p><b>What endorsements besides the </b><b><i>Daily Nexus</i></b><b> can candidates get? Is there a list? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is not an explicit list of who can endorse, but rather only a list of who cannot endorse candidates. As stated in Legal Code, all A.S. entities cannot endorse candidates and parties. Further details about endorsements can be found on page 283 of the 2018-2019 version of Legal Code, which can be found at the bottom of this article. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 22, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why doesn’t A.S. have greater authority over the Isla Vista area?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. has representation within I.V. through the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) position, held by third-year global studies major Jeike Meijer. The EVPLA can advocate on behalf of UCSB students’ needs in I.V., but they cannot make direct changes to laws; instead, they work with governmental bodies that make those decisions, such as the I.V. Recreation and Parks District and the I.V. Community Service District, to make change within the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB owns property in I.V., but cannot control or make decisions over I.V. as a whole because, by nature, the two are separate. UCSB is a university; I.V. is an unincorporated district – and home to families, private businesses and more, not just students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because UCSB and I.V.’s histories are so intertwined, there are ways in which the university can directly or indirectly exert influence over what happens in I.V. For example, the university has a representative on the I.V. CSD, who serves as a coordinator between the two entities. Additionally, UCSB gives a $200,000 grant to the district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates for this year’s EVPLA election are third-year political science Matthew Griffin and third-year environmental studies major Christian Ornelas. </span></p>\n<p><b>What kind of compensation do A.S. members receive?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A.S. executive director and other full-time staff members within A.S. receive yearly salaries. For example, the current A.S. executive director, Marisela Marquez, received $110,911 for the 2017 fiscal year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Executives receive $3,000 per quarter, while A.S. senators receive $400 dollars per quarter for serving on the Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both face different sets of rules and requirements, which can be found in A.S. legal code. </span></p>\n<p><b>Does the Daily Nexus have beef with the A.S. Senate? What’s up with always criticizing their shortcomings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not “have beef” with the A.S. Senate. Just as with any other relationship between reporters and the government officials they cover, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports on both the Senate’s shortfalls and its successes. As a campus newspaper, it is important that we hold A.S. accountable because, after all, the same people who read the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are the ones giving A.S. their money to spend. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the ideological differences between CU and I.V. party?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During our endorsement interviews, we asked each candidate running for an executive position about the difference between Campus United and the Isla Vista Party, and they all gave various vague answers. Some candidates said their party thinks outside of the box, while others said their party was like a family to them. The executive candidates also emphasized that they would not speak about the opposing party. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United has a website that includes information about its platform: </span><a href=\"https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://ucsbcampusunited.org/platform</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Party has a Facebook page that is regularly updated. However, there aren’t many details on the page regarding the party’s platform and ideologies: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IslaVistaParty/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.facebook.com/IslaVistaParty/</span></a></p>\n<p><b>Where can I view a list of candidates?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A list of all candidates can be seen on our website <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b>What are some of the programs that come from my student fees?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides providing Senate with a budget to spend throughout the year, your student fees fund a variety of different programs across campus. For example, the A.S. Program Borard is funded by student fees, as well as the Bike Shop, Queer Commission, Food Bank and many others. You can find the full list of A.S. funded entities here: </span><a href=\"https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.as.ucsb.edu/entities/</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Updated [April 16, 2019]</em></p>\n<p><b>Why should I care?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each student enrolled at UCSB pays </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.61 every quarter to Associated Students to go toward “a wide variety of operations of Associated Students that benefit the students of UCSB, the campus and the surrounding community,” as written on the A.S. Finance and Business website. This amounts to an estimated $14 million a year, as of last reported numbers. </span></p>\n<p><b>What are the different A.S. positions? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. serves as an umbrella for dozens of organizations. The most well-known divisions of A.S. include the legislative branch (the A.S. Senate), the executive branch (the A.S. Executives) and the judicial branch (the A.S. Judicial Council). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the A.S. Senate, there are 25 senatorial positions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 25 senators are elected based on different constituencies; there are 12 off-campus senator seats, five on-campus senator seats, four Letters &amp; Science senator seats, one College of Engineering senator seat, one College of Creative Studies senator seat, one transfer senator seat and one university-owned off-campus senator seat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been no College of Creative Studies senator for the past school year, and no students have declared candidacy for the seat this year’s election as of press time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within the executive branch, there are five A.S. executive positions: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UCSBASOP/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ivpucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">internal vice president</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (IVP), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ucsbEVPSA/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARB6ux9CZOA9eMPbLvNNLuo5kIGZGoj3jtgxwRvfm0rLaYKe9A5qbzuS2FCpyxrzSJFwR85Z0BVYmuyX\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for statewide affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPSA), </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/evplaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">external vice president for local affairs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EVPLA) and the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/osaucsb/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student advocate general</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (S.A.G.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EVPSA position has been vacant since Spring Quarter 2018 following the disqualification of EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales and the two subsequent special elections that failed to meet the voter threshold. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The president serves as a representative of UCSB at the systemwide level and is a voice for students within the UCSB administration. They also work on projects within their own office to enhance the UCSB student experience and sit on various committees around campus. The IVP presides over the A.S. Senate, and has the power to serve as a tie-breaking vote. The EVPLA works with local government bodies, such as the I.V. Community Services District and the I.V. Recreation and Park District. The EVPSA advocates for UCSB student issues at the state and federal level. Finally, the S.A.G. heads up the Office of the Student Advocate, which provides support for students/student groups who are involved in a dispute with the university.</span></p>\n<p><b>How can you reach out to your senators and other executives?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple ways to contact your senators and executives. As of this year, the 69th senate passed a resolution that requires senators to provide their constituencies with an official Facebook page. A.S. executives also have official Facebook pages, where you will find their office hours, the location of their office hours, contact info and projects they are currently undertaking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address the entire Senate as a whole, students or community members can speak at public forum during weekly Senate meetings, which begin at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in the Flying A room of the University Center. The Senate does not hold meetings during Week 10 or finals week. </span></p>\n<p><b>When does voting begin?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voting officially begins on April 22 at 8 a.m., or Monday of Week 4. It ends on April 25 at 4 p.m. The results will be announced on April 25 at a time and place to be determined. Log onto G.O.L.D. to cast your vote.</span></p>\n<p>A full version of A.S.

We make mistakes and we own up to them. We issue corrections when needed and we are open, time and time again, as to how our reporting process works.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> has a duty to the student body to keep them informed of relevant issues in their community. We also do our best as student journalists to hold elected officials accountable.</p>\n<p>We feel the need to write this editorial because the Associated Students (A.S.) 69th Senate is not doing that for themselves.</p>\n<p>The Senate has a duty to the student body to represent students’ issues, one they have not maintained since taking office.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Nexus’</em> point of view – as individuals who extensively cover Senate’s resolutions, meetings and more – the 69th Senate consistently fails to represent our student body and is, in no way, accountable to the people they were elected to serve.</p>\n<p>A.S. Senate is a group of 24 students who decide how millions of dollars of our student fees are spent. The senators are paid $350 a quarter in honorarium and are required to fulfill specific duties, such as holding office hours.</p>\n<p>However, A.S. Senate as a whole lacks transparency. Below are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Senate did not have a public list of their office hours until the <em>Nexus</em> requested it during Week 6. The 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code mandates this list be “scheduled and publicly posted by the end of the third (3rd) week of each quarter.”</li>\n<li>They use Facebook to communicate Senate-related announcements to their constituents, despite the fact that you need to have a Facebook account and be Facebook friends with them to see anything remotely related to their positions.</li>\n<li>They did not establish a Senate bill database until after the <em>Nexus</em> created one last year in order to make every resolution easily accessible to the senators’ constituents.</li>\n<li>They demanded The Bottom Line (TBL) turn off a livestream at the end of a public Senate meeting, which TBL – and the <em>Nexus</em> – had every right to record.</li>\n<li>Their website is still not updated with the names and office hours of this year’s senators, even though it is the end of Week 7.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Senators are not holding themselves accountable; instead, they consistently act unprofessionally as elected officials who control millions of dollars in student fees.</p>\n<p>We do want to acknowledge the valuable work some senators have been doing. For example, Senator Zion Solomon has worked to compile finance reports that detail the amount of money allocated to organizations during Finance and Business Committee meetings.</p>\n<p>To our knowledge, the finance reports are only posted on Facebook, but Senator Solomon’s efforts show a commitment to transparency.</p>\n<p>Senators do good things. We’re not saying they don’t. However, many of them have not been doing the jobs they have been elected to do.</p>\n<p>Even the leader of Senate – Internal Vice President (IVP) Steven Ho, whose pay amounts to $3,000 a quarter – fails to take his job seriously.</p>\n<p>His job is to hold his senators accountable, to keep some semblance of decorum during Senate meetings and to ensure senators follow Legal Code.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Ho fails to show professionalism, even during Senate meetings. Ho, as the IVP, sets the tone for how senators should conduct themselves during meetings.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/46381421_335573963663022_3500040927651561472_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1279546202\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">retweeted</a> a tweet from Senate minute-taker Isabella Liu, which stated “someone get me out of this meeting please.” Ho replied to the tweet at 7:26 p.m. with “someone save us please.”</p>\n<p>Later during that same meeting, Ho <a href=\"http://46498938_2203294369732002_1446147155357073408_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1131452933\" data-slb-group=\"84956\">tweeted</a> “this meeting has been going on in circles, I wish I could get a proxy.”</p>\n<p>Both Twitter accounts are public.</p>\n<p>What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n<p>During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, a UCSB alumnus stood up at public forum, identifying themselves as a “concerned Gaucho.”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to tell you one simple sentence, and I’m not taking any questions, but I recently realized that the <em>Daily Nexus</em> is really good for toilet paper and I want to recommend it to all of you. It’s really good to wipe your ass with,” the individual said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just trash, garbage newspaper so please use it to wipe your butthole with whenever you’re taking a shit, that’s my recommendation.”</p>\n<p>His words are what spurred this editorial, but they are not the focus of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What senators – and Ho – seem to forget is that representing our student body is a privilege, one that they have been given by the students.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead, we would like to call attention to the way the senators and proxies, as well as Ho, responded to this individual.</p>\n<p>In response to this individual’s words, senators and proxies laughed and clapped their hands over their mouths. One even bowed toward the podium as the individual walked away.</p>\n<p>Ho could be seen recording the individual and laughing. The video <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9540.TRIM_.mov\">was posted</a> on Ho’s Snapchat story with the caption “I have no words 4 dis.”</p>\n<p>The comments from “concerned Gaucho” were not said in order to provide constructive dialogue or a call to action. Rather, they were blatantly inflammatory and used to reap attention.</p>\n<p>A few members of A.S. spoke with the <em>Nexus</em> following these remarks, condemning the sentiments. Yet no one publicly addressed the individual’s comments for the rest of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Senators are not required to defend the <em>Nexus</em>, but there are standards they must adhere to.</p>\n<p>According to their own 2018-2019 A.S. Legal Code, members of A.S. must “treat each other and those in the community with behavior that fosters a safe, inclusive environment for everyone. This behavior includes but is not limited to: professionalism, compassion, courtesy, civility, and respect.”</p>\n<p>We would have hoped senators would have acted in accordance to their Legal Code, as their response to “concerned Gaucho”’s remarks was not professional, compassionate, courteous, civil or respectful.</p>\n<p>Instead, our paid, elected officials laughed at the hateful comments.</p>\n<p>They did not keep composure – they joined in on the joke.</p>\n<p>This is a student government, and we are a student newspaper. To the world outside our university, it is easy to dismiss our student government’s actions as an inconsequential side effect of decisions made by 18 to 22-year-olds.</p>\n<p>However, these people are our future “real-world” leaders. From what we have observed so far, there is a dangerous precedent in motion.</p>\n<p>Maybe we’re asking for too much. But we certainly hope that’s not the case.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84956\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84956\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/editorial-a-demand-for-standards-re-a-s-senate/","id":2168,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2167,2166,2165],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Retracts EVPSA Endorsement","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2018-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Facts-UCSB-Campus-by-Olivia-Consterdine-PRINT-2-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The editorial board believes it is best to formally retract the endorsement of Mayela Morales for the executive position.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The <em>Nexus</em> is retracting its endorsement of Mayela Morales for the position of external vice president for statewide affairs.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> editorial board published endorsements of all executive candidates running in the Associated Students elections on Thursday, April 19.</p>\n<p>On April 15, the <em>Nexus</em> received an anonymous email alleging financial mismanagement by a student during a lobbying trip for students to speak with state and national representatives in early April in Washington, D.C. and in Sacramento in March. The student was running as an executive candidate in the spring A.S. election, according to the email.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> began to investigate the matter immediately but was unable to confirm which candidate the anonymous sender referred to.</p>\n<p>After the <em>Nexus</em> published its <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/mayela-morales-for-external-vice-president-for-statewide-affairs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsement of Morales</a>, the editorial board began to receive other complaints about organizational conflicts during the student lobby visits. These complaints were from three anonymous sources that worked with Morales in preparation for these conferences.</p>\n<p>Morales was the internal director of Lobby Corps as well as a member of USSA, which organized both lobbying trips.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Nexus</em> editorial board was aware of complaints against an executive candidate prior to writing the endorsement, we needed confirmation through evidence and documentation to retract our choice. Our endorsement of Morales was based on an extensive interview process and a discussion with the editorial board.</p>\n<p>Based on Morales’s interview and other involvement on campus, we do believe Morales is the right person for the position; however, our investigation into the lobbying trip conflicts has led us to retract our endorsement.</p>\n<p>According to documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>, Morales failed to communicate with a colleague about transportation to the Sacramento lobby visit. The failure to communicate with the colleague in a timely manner resulted in a failure to organize the transportation.</p>\n<p>Further documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em> on Tuesday, April 24, revealed Morales’s failure to complete the tasks she volunteered to do for a Washington, D.C. lobby visit, resulting in the untimely scheduling of flights and hotel accommodations.</p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the beginning of planning the conference, I informed the EVPSA that I was having problems with my phone because it had been in repairs for a minute. As I couldn’t afford to buy a new phone, I told everyone involved in planning the conference that I would be providing my support during my individual meetings with them, rather than over text,” </span>Morales told the <em>Nexus</em> in a statement.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since the beginning of 2018, due to some family financial issues, I haven’t had phone service which has made communication, at times, impossible. This is something every person I work with has been aware of since the beginning,” Morales added in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As colleagues and friends, the other people involved in the planning of the trips were aware of some of the mental health related issues I was personally going through at the time,” Morales also said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p>The editorial board believes it is best to formally retract the endorsement of Mayela Morales for the executive position. We apologize for our endorsement in light of this new information.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from Morales regarding her communication while organizing the lobby visits.  </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82722\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82722\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/nexus-retracts-evpsa-endorsement/","id":2281,"author":{"id":16,"name":"Daily Nexus Editorial Board"},"related":[2280,2279,2278],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/16"}},"__N_SSG":true}
