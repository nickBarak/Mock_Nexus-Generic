On Saturday night, the Gauchos flipped the script with a comeback victory of their own over Cal State Northridge in five sets.</p>\n<p>It was an intense weekend of road volleyball for the Santa Barbara side, who snapped a three-game losing streak with the win over the Matadors. The Gauchos are now 12-9 overall and tied for fourth place at 5-5 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB had the Beach on their back foot to start things off on Friday night. Star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins was her usual dynamic self with 13 kills in those two sets, providing the closing three points in the Gauchos’ 25-20 opening-set win.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The attack was humming for UCSB early, particularly in that first set. The Gauchos hit at a .300 clip with an efficient 14 kills on only 30 attacks, before dropping to a .179 in the second set.</p>\n<p>That decline didn’t keep the Gauchos from securing the first two sets, but the Beach turned things around in the third set with a fairly commanding 25-20 victory. Playing with their backs against the wall, Long Beach State jumped out to a big lead early and never let up.</p>\n<p>The last two sets, on the other hand, were much more contested affairs.</p>\n<p>UCSB hit .389 as a team in the fourth set, but that wasn’t enough to best Long Beach State’s .424 clip as the hosts won the last three points to snag a 26-24 win. The fifth set was much lighter on offensive firepower but still packed plenty of drama, with the Beach pulling out another extra point victory 19-17 to secure the match.</p>\n<p>Ruddins led all attackers with 31 kills and was one dig shy of a double-double. She had help on the attack from Rowan Ennis (14 kills, .294 hitting percentage) and Torre Glasker (13 kills, 14 digs), both of whom have developed into consistent secondary options on the attack for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Olivia Lovenberg, as always, kept the UCSB attack flowing with 58 assists, and just missed out on her own double-double with nine digs. The freshman added two service aces as well for a respectable three-and-a-half total points.</p>\n<p>Friday’s loss pushed the UCSB losing streak to three games, the longest such slide the team has had all year. Another road game on Saturday night presented a tough turnaround for the Gauchos, even if the Matadors, now at 6-15 and 2-7 in the conference, are one of the Big West’s weaker teams.</p>\n<p>Even still, UCSB came close to losing their fourth straight on Saturday. CSUN secured a 25-19 win in the first and then outbattled the Gauchos to pick up the third set, which put themselves on the brink of their third victory in Big West play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos came storming right back, however, hitting .270 in the fourth set en route to a 25-19 victory of their own. Just like on Friday night, set five went to extra points, but this time UCSB managed to pull it out with a 20-18 win.</p>\n<p>Ruddins, Glasker, and Ennis once again paced the Gaucho offense, with Ruddins and Glasker both posting double-doubles as well. Emilia Petrarchi led all players with 22 digs, but it was Nicole Omwanghe and her 7 total blocks that really stood out on the defensive end for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>It was a solid UCSB team performance on defense, as the Matadors were able to muster a hitting percentage of just .172. That was enough for the attack to win a very back-and-forth match to snap the slide and keep the Gauchos in a tie for fourth place in the Big West with Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to avenge a painful loss a couple of weeks ago to Hawaii when the Gauchos fly halfway across the Pacific Ocean to take on the Rainbow Warriors next Saturday night at 10:00 PT.</p><div

The 20th pick of the 2017 NBA draft, Giles was the top-rated high school player in a recruiting class that included Jayson Tatum and Lonzo Ball, but multiple knee surgeries on both knees cut his sole season at Duke short and pushed him down in the draft.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The Kings played it safe last season and kept Giles on the shelf all year, but news came out around the All-Star Break that he was dominating practices.

He’s got a jump shot, too, which means he’s a ball-handling seven-footer who can rebound, pass] and knock down threes. He’s also a pretty good defender, if you’re into that.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.25pt;\"><span style=\"color: black;\">A quick heads up: When you become a Kings fan, you also have to become a devout Harry Giles apostle.

Sitting at 16-1 overall and 6-0 in the conference, the No. 12 ranked Mustangs have rocketed out to one of their best starts in program history.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, the UCSB women’s volleyball team will get its chance to come at the queens of the conference in the Blue-Green rivalry matchup in San Luis Obispo. The Gauchos, at 12-7 and 4-3, won’t be favored, but they’ll certainly be motivated to finally bring the Mustangs down.</p>\n<p>The conditions are mostly right for UCSB to have a chance at the upset. The Gauchos have had a full week of preparation and are coming off of both a strong sweep of CSUN last Tuesday and a hard-fought 3-2 loss to Hawaii on Friday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The latter match, while a loss, should embolden the Gauchos when it comes to their ability to hang with the Big West powerhouses. Hawaii is just a step behind Cal Poly in the standings at 9-6 overall and 5-1 in the conference, with that one loss at the hands of the Mustangs last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Any additional confidence UCSB can take into their Friday match will be a help against one of the nation’s highest ranked programs. Cal Poly is working on a 15-game win streak and has dropped only one set across their six Big West matches so far.</p>\n<p>Facing a juggernaut like the Mustangs, taking even a set on Friday night would be an accomplishment for the Gauchos. To take the match, UCSB will likely have to play better than it has all season.</p>\n<p>Such a performance starts at the top, with star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins. The powerhouse of the team, Ruddins is second in the nation in kills per set with 5.39 and boasts a career-best .271 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is largely unique among Big West programs in that they have a counter to Ruddins. Junior outside hitter Torrey Van Winden’s 5.07 kills per set is sixth-best in the nation, and her .369 hitting percentage is tops in the Big West. She’s both powerful and precise, and a pain to stop as a result.</p>\n<p>It might be a pain but stopping or limiting Van Winden is a key to victory against the Mustangs. Van Winden had her worst match of the season against Pitt in Cal Poly’s lone loss, hitting just .108 and mustering 3.25 kills per set, her second worst mark of the year.</p>\n<p>It will be a good sign for the Gauchos if they’re even in a position where they need to stop Van Winden. Throughout Big West play, the junior has had somewhat sparing usage in the Mustang attack, taking on more of the attacking load only when necessary, like with her 64 attacks and 29 kills against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s other attackers, such as Torrey’s older sister, Adlee, have handled more of the attacking function in the team’s other Big West matches. UCSB’s task defensively will be to neutralize those attackers and then neutralize Torrey Van Winden, something no team other than No. 6 Pitt has been able to do all year.</p>\n<p>UCSB has shown it can put in the work on defense so far in the Big West, which will be essential when it comes to stopping that Mustang attack. The Gauchos lead the Big West in digs per set with 18.50, best by over a full dig. Blocking hasn’t been quite as much of a strong suit, so the team will have to rely on that digging process to respond to Cal Poly’s strikes.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCSB will have to continue to show off some of its newfound balance. The Gauchos boast four different players with over two kills per set, with Ruddins, her sister Gigi, Torre Glasker and middle blocker Charlie Robinson comprising the list.</p>\n<p>That continued versatility is crucial to any chance of Gaucho success in the Blue-Green rivalry. Without it, the Mustangs will be able to key in on Ruddins, greatly simplifying their defensive responsibilities.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot that needs to go right for UCSB to even have a chance of scratching the first blemish into Cal Poly’s Big West record. That’s to be expected when taking on No. 12 team in the nation, one that hasn’t lost a match since August and has dropped just four sets since the start of September.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos manage to dig their way out from under the Cal Poly attack and keep the Mustangs on their back heel with a varied attack of their own, they’ll be putting themselves in position to come back from San Luis Obispo with a season-defining win. That’s what it takes to stop a stampede.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/ucsb-womens-volleyball-starts-road-trip-at-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/ucsb-womens-volleyball-starts-road-trip-at-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/ucsb-womens-volleyball-starts-road-trip-at-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/ucsb-womens-volleyball-starts-road-trip-at-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/ucsb-womens-volleyball-starts-road-trip-at-cal-poly/","id":5569,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5568,5567,5566],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Preview: Women’s Volleyball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2018-09-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.24.2014-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.24.2014-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Women's volleyball in the Big West conference, previewed by staff writer Spencer Ault.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.24.2014-11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"937717122\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83993\"><img data-attachment-id=\"58765\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-24/gauchos-edged-by-hawaii-on-senior-night/2nd-photo-w-volleyball-hawaii-def-ucsb-3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/W-Volleyball-v-Hawaii-by-Dustin-Harris_for-11.24.2014-11.jpg?fit=2000%2C1960&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Dustin Harris\\/Daily Nexus&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Outside hitter Ali Barbeau retrieves a short serve from the Rainbow Wahine during the match.

The team sits among some of the best teams in the NCAA across several statistics this season, [and returns reliable defensive specialist Emilia Petrarchi and last season’s NCAA leader in kills per set, Lindsey Ruddins.]</p>\n<p>Ruddins is back and humming in 2018, as she’s already garnering a couple Big West Player of the Week Awards. This junior outside hitter is second in the nation with 5.57 kills per set so far this year, and leads the Big West in points per set as well.</p>\n<p>She’s been set up primarily by freshman setter Olivia Lovenberg, who is 13<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA with 11.46 assists per set, second best among all freshman. Lovenberg, like Ruddins, has received a couple Big West awards already, and will be looking to add a handful more in conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been unable to develop a secondary threat next to Ruddins to keep opposing teams honest, something that could hold the team back these next several weeks. Torre Glasker, another outside hitter, is second on the team and 17th in the conference with 2.54 kills per set.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s pre-conference schedule was light, featuring no ranked teams and only a couple teams on the bubble of NCAA prominence. Big West play, then, will be a test of the unproven squad.</p>\n<p>They’ll be taking on a variety of talents, ranging from some of the worst teams to one of the best. What follows is a speculative ranking of those teams, and where UCSB likely fits in as it heads into the season.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly</strong> – The 15<sup>th</sup> ranked team in the NCAA, the Big West appears to be the Mustangs’ if they want it. Led by outside hitter Torrey Van Winden (7<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA with 4.93 kills/set) and her sister, Allie Van Winden (8<sup>th</sup> in the Big West with 3.17 k/s), the Mustangs have a potent attack set up by freshman setter Avalon DeNecochea (55<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA with 10.32 assists/set). They’ve got two wins over #17 UCLA and will be seeking to defend their 2017 Big West title.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Long Beach State</strong> – The Beach enters Big West play a half-game behind UCSB and UC Davis at 8-5, but that’s with losses to #17 UCLA and #12 Oregon. They’ve got a stifling pair of blockers up front in Emma Kirst (1.06 blocks/set) and Yizhi Xue (1.00 b/s). The offensive load is distributed similarly, with Hailey Harward, Kashuana Williams and their almost three kills per set bearing the brunt of it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Hawaii</strong> – The Rainbow Warriors are usually contenders in the Big West, and while their 4-5 non-conference record isn’t too impressive, they’ll likely be near the tops of the standings in a few weeks’ time. Two losses to #12 Oregon set the team back a bit last week, but they’ve got the tools to overcome. Setters Faith Ma’afala and Norene Iosia have Hawaii sitting in 28<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA in assists per set, and McKenna Granato leads the team in kills per set with 3.48.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>UC Davis</strong> – Tied with UCSB with an 8-4 record, the Aggies are a well-rounded squad. They’re 38<sup>th</sup> in the nation in opposing hitting percentage and 47<sup>th</sup> in kills per set, but they’ve yet to be tested against a top-25 team. Malia Bolko is 21<sup>st</sup> in the NCAA with 5.38 digs per set as the linchpin of the defense, and Emily Allen leads the offense and is 5<sup>th</sup> in the Big West with 4.09 kills per set.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine</strong> – Not much stands out about the 6-6 Anteaters from their non-conference slate. They dropped two games to top 25 teams, one to #23 Utah and the other to #8 Illinois. They’re not in the top 50 in the NCAA in any statistics and Haley DeSales and her 3<sup>rd</sup>-best 4.74 digs per set is their only top-three Big West statistic. Conference play will be revealing for this team, with a lot of space to move up, or down.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton</strong> – Fullerton also enters Big West play with a 6-6 nonconference record, but they don’t have the excuse of any top 25 losses. Their schedule, compared to Irvine’s, was much easier, slotting them in below the Anteaters. The Titans are 49<sup>th</sup> in opposing hitting percentage, thanks largely to Maya Riddlesprigger’s 4<sup>th</sup> in the Big West 1 .00 blocks per set.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside</strong> – The Highlanders are 25<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA in digs per set, but all that’s gotten them is a 5-6 record, even without any top 25 games. Setter Chelsea Doyle is third in the Big West with 10.00 assists per set and 9<sup>th</sup> with 3.48 digs per set. Kaiulani Ahuna has provided the bulk of their offense with 5.25 kills per set, 4<sup>th</sup> in the NCAA, but she’s also far and away 1<sup>st</sup> in the Big West with 93 errors.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>CSUN</strong> – Statistically, the Matadors are the worst team in the Big West. They’re a conference-worst, coming in 4-8, although that includes losses to #11 Florida and #13 Washington. They’re last in kills, digs, blocks and assists per set, as well as hitting percentage. They’re only second-to-last in service aces per set, however, so at least they’ve got that to hold on to.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83993\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/big-west-preview-womens-volleyball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83993\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/big-west-preview-womens-volleyball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/big-west-preview-womens-volleyball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/big-west-preview-womens-volleyball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/big-west-preview-womens-volleyball/","id":5565,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[5564,5563,5562],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Guess Who’s Back?

Now that they’re here, though, the Gauchos might as well keep things going.<br>\nThe first step in that process comes on Thursday night when the team takes on Cal Poly in its first-round matchup at the Honda Center. Should the Gauchos take that game, they’ll be just two wins away from the Big West title and a spot in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Those other two games, however, aren’t on UCSB’s radar at all.</p>\n<p>They’re focused instead on Cal Poly, as if this was any other week.</p>\n<p>“We’re just focused on one game at a time,” Pasternack said. “We’re treating this like a normal Thursday-Saturday week, and we’re locked into this one game. We’ll worry about the next one if we win [on Thursday].”</p>\n<p>Of course, it isn’t just a normal week, no matter what Pasternack says.</p>\n<p>In a single-elimination tournament, even a game against No. 7-seeded Cal Poly has more on the line than any other game the Gauchos have played this season, but that doesn’t mean the team is completely new to the bright lights.</p>\n<p>“We’ve played on big stages this season,” Pasternack explained. “We’ve played against Pitt, Texas A&amp;M and USC, and we didn’t win but we were competitive. We went to UC Davis and got a big win. Our guys are battle-tested.”</p>\n<p>UCSB really couldn’t have asked for a better opponent than Cal Poly to kick off the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>The two teams met just this past Saturday, when the Gauchos dismantled the Mustangs 86-61 in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had one of their best offensive games in weeks, as those 86 points were the most the team had scored since Feb. 8, along with its 27 assists going down as a season-high.</p>\n<p>“That game [against Cal Poly] gave our guys a great deal of confidence. They’re hungry to get back on the court,” Pasternack said.</p>\n<p>Max Heidegger, UCSB’s leading scorer this season at 19.4 points per game, had a little bit of a bounce back game offensively against the Mustangs, something the team is hoping carries through into the tournament.</p>\n<p>The sophomore guard had 23 points, knocked down five three-pointers and shot 50 percent from the field for the first time since Jan. 17.</p>\n<p>“For Max, you have to look at his complete body of work,” Pasternack said. “You can’t get caught up in his last game or his last few games. He’s shooting 40 percent from three this season, and he’s got the defense focused on him. He’s a complete player, and he dominated on defense last game.”</p>\n<p>The timely return of Jalen Canty two games ago gave the Gauchos just enough time to work the talented senior big man back into the lineup.</p>\n<p>That’s important for a UCSB offense that flows a lot smoother with both Canty and graduate transfer forward Leland King II attracting attention inside, and for a defense that relies on Canty’s menacing rim presence.</p>\n<p>Canty’s positive influence on the offensive end was obvious last Saturday against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Having two major inside threats forced the Cal Poly defense to pull some of their attention away from the three-point line, something that didn’t happen much while the forward was out.</p>\n<p>That was key in the Gauchos’ 86-point performance, which was more than enough offense given UCSB’s defensive performance.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs shot just 39 percent from the field and had only two players score in the double digits.</p>\n<p>One of those players was senior guard Victor Joseph, who led the Mustangs with 14.4 points per game, and had 16 points on Saturday, good for second on the team.<br>\nJunior point guard Donovan Fields, who averaged 13.3 points per game, typically seconds Joseph but on Saturday it was Josh Martin and his 20 points that shouldered the rest of the offensive load.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s 9-21 overall record and 4-12 record in the Big West don’t do much to hype them up as a potential spoiler of UCSB’s title hopes, but both recent and not-quite-as-recent history suggests they still shouldn’t be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos suffered a last-second loss in their first Big West game of the year at the hands of the Mustangs on Jan. 4, just over two months ago, which gave Saturday’s drubbing some revenge flavoring.</p>\n<p>In 2015, UCSB took on Cal Poly in the exact same 2-7 matchup in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament, and just escaped with a 54-50 victory.</p>\n<p>That tournament matchup was, of course, three years ago, and Saturday’s win turned the Jan. 4 matchup into history, but both games should give any UCSB fan or player looking past the coming contest reason to reconsider.</p>\n<p>The turnaround from a year ago began with the final whistle of Big West play and the early April hiring of Pasternack.</p>\n<p>Much of the success in fact, stems from the team forgetting what exactly they were bouncing back from.</p>\n<p>“Our guys have just locked into the process,” Pasternack said. “They’ve had a chip on their shoulder for the last ten months, but they didn’t worry about last season. They’ve been focused on this one.”</p>\n<p>While Pasternack and his players may claim to be focused on just the upcoming Cal Poly game, there’s no question that the whole tournament looms large.</p>\n<p>Three tournament victories, and the Gauchos can put the ultimate cap on their remarkable turnaround.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly on Thursday night at 8:30 p.m. in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament at the Honda Center in Anaheim.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 8</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81837\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81837\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/","id":973,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[972,971,970],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"March Is Here!

Two tough losses – the first against UC Davis and the second against UC Irvine – dropped the Gauchos behind the Anteaters and into a tie for second with the Aggies, a much more precarious position.</p>\n<p>Those two losses were the result of two of the worst offensive performances the Gauchos, now 21-7 overall and 10-4 in the Big West, have had all year, but the team showed signs of a resurgence in their win on Saturday over CSUN.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The game [against CSUN] was our best offensive efficiency game of the year,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “I thought our guys did a great job of sharing the basketball and getting great shots on offense, which the previous two games we struggled with.”</p>\n<p>Thursday night’s game against the Beach will be a test of the sustainability of the rediscovered offensive success for both the team and its key players. Graduate transfer forward Leland King II bounced back from a combined nine points against Davis and Irvine with a 25-point, 12-rebound performance against CSUN, and his continued production will be essential to the Gauchos’ success.</p>\n<p>Equally important to offensive production, of course, is defensive performance. In Pasternack’s eyes, the two are directly tied together, as defensive success directly feeds offensive success.</p>\n<p>“This week, our complete focus is being able to defend and rebound for 40 minutes,” Pasternack said. “When we do that, our offense will take care of itself. When the ball is coming out of the net, we don’t get fast break points. When we can get stops and run, that’s when we’re at our best.”</p>\n<p>The return of senior forward Jalen Canty will likely be a big help in both the defensive and offensive departments. Canty missed the last six games due to a suspension for violating team rules, but will return on Thursday night against Long Beach, giving UCSB some sorely needed shot-blocking and offensive diversity.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State will enter the Thunderdome as losers of its last three games and in a tie for fifth place in the Big West at 7-7. The Beach has struggled to get stops in each of their last three games, surrendering at least 70 points in all of them and 80 points twice.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81650\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"16742538\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81674\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81650\" data-attachment-id=\"81650\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/march-is-here-the-race-for-first-continues-for-ucsb/mbball_vsucd-180217-dustinharris-11-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-81650\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MBball_vsUCD-180217-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81650\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">After seeing an opening, Marcus Jackson heads for the hoop. <em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The story offensively for Long Beach State is the same as it was when UCSB traveled to the Walter Pyramid a few weeks ago: senior forward Gabe Levin is the one to stop. Levin is leading the Big West in conference scoring per game, but he doesn’t have another teammate in the top 20.</p>\n<p>After Long Beach State on Thursday, the Gauchos will take on Cal Poly in the Thunderdome on Saturday for Senior Night. The Mustangs have just four wins in Big West play this season, but one of those came at UCSB’s expense all the way back on Jan. 4, so Saturday’s Blue-Green Rivalry matchup has the added motivation of a revenge game for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>As UCSB’s last game before the Big West Tournament, the matchup against Cal Poly will also be an important tune-up for the team. Working Canty back into the lineup and continuing to rehabilitate the offense will both take time, something the Gauchos won’t have much of once the tournament starts.</p>\n<p>As evidenced by their 9-19 overall record and 4-10 mark in conference play, the Mustangs have had a rough go of things this season. That Jan. 4 win over UCSB, secured with three last-second free throws, may have been the high point of Cal Poly’s season.</p>\n<p>All the same, the Gauchos can’t afford to overlook the Mustangs, as tempting as it might be with the Big West Tournament in sight. Guards Victor Joseph and Donovan Fields hurt UCSB the first time around and are coming off of strong games against CSUN.</p>\n<p>Joseph is sixth in the Big West in points per game in conference play with 15.8 and has knocked down 40.9 of his three-point attempts against conference opponents. The senior guard dropped 36 points in the Mustangs’ double-overtime win over the Marauders, and will test the Gauchos’ ability to provide 40 minutes of solid defense.</p>\n<p>A sweep of this week would give UCSB a home record of 13-1 for the year, its best since at least the 1980-81 season. Two strong games by King and Max Heidegger would also likely push the pair into third place on the list of all time UCSB scoring duos, as they currently sit just 41 points behind Michael Bryson and Gabe Vincent, who combined for 1,042 points in 2015-16.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot on the line for the Gauchos this week, but most important is the first-place slot in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Two wins guarantee UCSB at least a half-share of the regular season crown, an incredible turnaround for a team that finished in dead last at 4-12 last season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host Long Beach State on Thursday night at 8 p.m. in an ESPNU-televised matchup, and then close their season in the Thunderdome against Cal Poly on Saturday at 7 p.m. for Senior Night.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 1</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB went 11-22 from three-point land, their first time shooting over 35 percent from distance since a February 8 victory over UC Davis.</p>\n<p>In a major departure from their five total assists against UC Irvine on Thursday, the Gauchos racked up 19 assists against CSUN. That’s the team’s highest total in over a month, and representative of their rejuvenated generosity.</p>\n<p>Leland King II seemed similarly rejuvenated. The graduate transfer put up 25 points and 12 rebounds while shooting 73 percent from the field and dishing out five assists. That last number is tied for a season-high for King, who turned the ball over just twice.</p>\n<p>King’s strong performance Saturday night was a significant turnaround from his previous two games, in which he scored a combined total of nine points. The 6-7 forward also knocked down his first two three-pointers in the last four games.</p>\n<p>Point guard Marcus Jackson led all Gauchos with eight assists against just one turnover, as the graduate transfer provided a stable and generous hand at the top of the offense.</p>\n<p>Guards Gabe Vincent and Max Heidegger particularly benefited from their teammates’ generosity. Both guards notched 17 points and knocked down four threes, while putting up balanced stat sheets outside of the point totals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were very starter-heavy, getting only ten points from their bench, but that didn’t matter much Saturday night. CSUN took an early 3-2 lead on a Carl Brown three-pointer, but UCSB controlled the game from that point.</p>\n<p>King had 17 of his 25 points in the first half, and was far and away the most effective player on either team for those first 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>The Matadors simply had no answer for the graduate transfer, who single-handedly outscored his hosts by a 9-5 margin over a five-minute stretch late in the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB took a 39-25 lead into halftime, and managed to expand their advantage to 19 with 16:31 to go in the second. That was as large as their lead would get, but it was more than enough for the Gauchos to close things out.</p>\n<p>CSUN did put up a tough fight in that second half, outscoring UCSB 48-43 over the last 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>A Matador run cut the Gaucho lead to just five with 6:50 to go, but that was as close as Northridge would get to pulling off the comeback.</p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, the Gauchos pulled away down the stretch. A pair of three-pointers, the first from Jackson and the second from Vincent, pushed the UCSB lead back up to ten, and a broad offensive effort from the starters ensured that things never got much closer than that.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s Tavrion Dawson had perhaps the most balanced stat sheet of the night with 22 points, eight rebonds and six assists.</p>\n<p>Dawson was the primary offensive engine behind the Matadors’ late-game gasp, as the 6-8 senior forward poured in 16 points in just the second half alone.</p>\n<p>While Saturday’s game was a real reversal of the Gauchos’ prior offensive woes, it was by no means a guarantee of similar things to come. For that, UCSB will have to put up points against a team that isn’t sitting at the bottom of the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have that chance next week when they take on Long Beach State, just before they try to avenge their heartbreaking last-second loss to Cal Poly way back at the beginning of conference play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81619\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81619\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/gauchos-defeat-csun-in-final-road-match-of-the-season/","id":951,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[950,949,948],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho-Mania: MBB Carries 7-Game Streak Into LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018.02.03_StephenManga_MBball-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018.02.03_StephenManga_MBball-6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Holding on to first place in the Big West is one of the main priorities for the UCSB men's basketball team.

The road to the NCAA Tournament will likely go through at least one of these three teams, after all.</p>\n<p>The first two teams on the schedule, Long Beach State and UC Davis, are both locked in a three-way tie with Cal State Fullerton for third place in the Big West. They are behind the Gauchos and the Anteaters, respectively.</p>\n<p>First up are the Long Beach State 49ers, who have struggled against their peers in the Big West standings. The 49ers are 1-4 in games against UCD, UCI and CSUF, with the lone win coming against the Titans back in January.</p>\n<p>Those four losses make up the entirety of Long Beach’s conference blemishes.</p>\n<p>The 49ers are 7-4 in the Big West, and they have suffered from some bad luck with three single-digit losses.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Long Beach game plan revolves around transfer senior Gabe Levin. The 6-7 forward is averaging a team-high 18.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game in around 30 minutes of action a night.</p>\n<p>Levin has outright led the 49ers in scoring in all but two of their Big West games, and is leading the conference in scoring in Big West play. Unsurprisingly, the senior is key to Long Beach success, and is a common focal point for defenses.</p>\n<p>Opposing defenses can afford to focus on Levin because his supporting cast hasn’t done much to make them pay for doing so.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have four players – Max Heidegger, Jalen Canty, Leland King II and Gabe Vincent – between Levin and his next closest teammate in conference scoring.</p>\n<p>Part of that is due to junior transfer guard Bryan Alberts’s nine-game absence due to injury, but the Gonzaga transfer has been slow to readjust since returning to the lineup four games ago.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Temidayo Yussuf has stepped up to give the 49ers another low post threat, and put up a 17 point, 11 rebound double-double in his most recent game against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>The 49ers will host the Gauchos on Thursday, which plays to a major advantage for a Long Beach State team that is 7-4 at the Walter Pyramid and just 5-8 in away games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, on the other hand, have proven themselves to be able road warriors with a 7-5 away record, including a major win in Davis over the Aggies most recently.</p>\n<p>That win last Thursday is what propelled UCSB to their solitary perch atop the standings, but it’s unlikely to be a comfortable position.</p>\n<p>Even if the Gauchos are able to fight off the 49ers on Thursday, they’ll then have to take on the Aggies once more on Saturday, this time in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>With a home winning streak of 11 games to start the season, the longest such run in school history, the Gauchos have reason to feel confident even against such formidable and motivated guests as the Aggies.</p>\n<p>In the first matchup, UCSB controlled much of the game, aside from a strong stretch run by UC Davis to make things close late in the game. Junior forward Jarriesse Blackmon, receiving extra minutes in the absence of Canty, was instrumental late in the game with eight points, all in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been able to overcome Canty’s absence due to a suspension for violating team rules, but the team has made no announcements on the timetable for his return. Barring a change in status before Thursday, UCSB will likely have to adapt once again.</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos were able to do so thanks to a balanced team offensive effort. Four players finished in double-digits, with Leland King II leading the way with 19 points and 15 rebounds, his fifth double-double of Big West play.</p>\n<p>UCSB won’t be the only team dealing with a mysterious and impactful suspension on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCD’s star forward, Chima Moneke, has missed the team’s last three games after being sent home prior to the team’s Feb. 3 game against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos are 2-0 without their suspended forward, the Aggies have struggled a bit more, going 1-2 while sliding down from first place in the Big West to a tie for third.</p>\n<p>The reasons and timetable for Moneke’s return are still up in the air, so it’s quite possible both teams will once again be shorthanded on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Junior guard TJ Shorts II has stepped up in Moneke’s absence with almost 27 points per game in the last three games. Junior Siler Schneider has also taken on an expanded role, but the Aggies haven’t been able to fully replicate Moneke’s production.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a tough midterms week ahead of them, with two games against teams with a combined conference record of 14-8.</p>\n<p>A successful week however, would cement the team’s status as the one to best in Big West play, and push UCSB past 20 wins for the first time since 2009-10.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on Long Beach State on Thursday in Long Beach at 7 p.m. The ’Chos then host UC Davis in the Thunderdome on Saturday at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A

Santa Barbara does hold the advantage in the overall mark boasting an 18-5 record compared to Davis’s 16-7 record.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, they’ll have their first head-to-head meeting in a clash for conference supremacy.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos will be coming in hot as winners of their last six games. It’s a streak that includes victories over some of the top teams in the conference, such as Hawaii and UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have a chance to take complete control of the Big West Thursday, but they’ll do so away from the friendly walls of the Thunderdome. The Gauchos are 11-0 at home this year, the longest such streak to start a season in school history, but they are just 6-5 on the road.</p>\n<p>Some of that disparity is attributable to the top-25 schools UCSB has played on the road, but an away win over a top Big West competitor would do wonders for the team’s confidence as it heads into the homestretch.</p>\n<p>A rough start to conference play defensively put the Gauchos in a hole early, but they’ve battled back since. No team has scored more than 70 points in regulation against UCSB since their Jan. 13 loss to Hawaii, a major turnaround that has helped propel the team up the Big West standings.</p>\n<p>A strong defense will be especially important against a UC Davis team that’s coming off of a 105-point performance, albeit in double overtime, against Long Beach State on Saturday. The Aggies won that game on a running three-pointer by TJ Shorts II with just two seconds to go. That’s a major high, and one that the Gauchos might be able to take advantage of on the comedown.</p>\n<p>To do so, UCSB will rely heavily on sophomore guard Max Heidegger and graduate transfer Leland King II on offense, just as they have all season. King has been particularly potent as of late, as his double-double average over the Gauchos’ two wins last week earned the forward the honor of Big West Player of the Week.</p>\n<p>King is now averaging 16.2 points and 10.6 rebounds on the year and is knocking down about two three-pointers a game at a 42.3 percent clip. That’s almost as good as Heidegger’s 42.4 percent rate from distance, a sparkling percentage that has propelled the sophomore to his team-leading 20.9 points per game.</p>\n<p>The major question mark heading into Thursday’s game is the status of King’s frontcourt mate, Jalen Canty. Canty, who missed Saturday’s game against CSUN due to a suspension for violation of a team rule, is averaging about 13 points and eight rebounds per game. As of Monday night, the team had made no announcement on the senior’s status for Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB isn’t alone in dealing with questions regarding a suspended big man. UCD sent senior forward Chima Moneke home before Saturday’s game in Long Beach and has also made no announcement as to whether or not the big man will play.</p>\n<p>If Moneke is out, that’s a major blow to the Aggies. The 6’6” forward is averaging a team-leading 18.4 points and 9.6 rebounds per game, and he proved himself on a big stage against Kansas in last year’s NCAA Tournament with 20 points and nine rebounds.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, UCD proved they could fill in for Moneke’s absence on the scoreboard, but his rebounding will be tougher to replace. No other player on the team is averaging more than four rebounds per game, and it’s likely that 6’3” guard Michael Onyebalu will struggle to replicate his 11-rebound performance from Saturday.</p>\n<p>Without Moneke, the offensive burden would likely fall to junior guards Shorts and Siler Schneider. Both players were successful in doing so against Long Beach, as Shorts put up a team-high 31 points while Schneider was close behind with 27.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear whether either big man, Canty or Moneke, will play on Saturday, but it’s a question that will have major impacts on the course of the game, and thus on the Big West.</p>\n<p>It’s taken about a month of conference play for these two teams to meet, and they’ll finally do so with very high stakes. Looming suspensions cast a pall over the long-awaited matchup, which will likely be determined by which team can adapt the best and break the deadlock in their favor.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take on UC Davis at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 8 at The Pavilion.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 8</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80905\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/battle-of-the-alpha-dogs-gauchos-travel-to-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80905\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/battle-of-the-alpha-dogs-gauchos-travel-to-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/battle-of-the-alpha-dogs-gauchos-travel-to-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/battle-of-the-alpha-dogs-gauchos-travel-to-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/battle-of-the-alpha-dogs-gauchos-travel-to-uc-davis/","id":167,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[166,165,164],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB’s Historic Home Streak Lives On with Win Over CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MBball-161106-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB keeps its best start in program history alive with a victory over the visiting CSUN Matadors.

When it finally did, it did so in a hurry.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos rode a 19-1 run over seven minutes in the second half to a 75-51 victory over the Matadors, pushing UCSB to 18-5 this season and 7-2 in the Big West. The win was also the Gauchos’ 11<sup>th</sup> home victory in a row to open the year, the best home start in school history.</p>\n<p>“When Coach (Pasternak) came in, he wanted to establish the Thunderdome as a good home court,” sophomore guard Max Heidegger said. “Hopefully the years will pass and even after we’re gone it’ll still be rocking.

UCSB and CSUN traded baskets and stops throughout the first half, which saw six lead changes, and neither team was able to get much going offensively.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot just 42 percent from the field, and 20 percent from three, in the first 20 minutes. CSUN was even less effective, shooting 31 percent on field goals, a testament to both UCSB’s defense as well as the Matadors’ general inability to put the ball in the basket.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s saving grace in that cold first half was their rebounding, which was something of a surprise considering standout big man Jalen Canty’s absence Saturday night due to an indefinite suspension for a violation of team rules. Even without the 6-8 forward averaging 7.8 rebounds per game, the Gauchos were able to turn their 10 first half offensive rebounds into 10 second-chance points.</p>\n<p>While CSUN’s shooting problems persisted into the second half, UCSB seemed to find a way to shoot through their problems. The Gauchos rebounded in the last 20 minutes by going 50 percent from the field and 55 percent from three-point land, a major catalyst in their 43-point second half explosion.</p>\n<p>“Guys just started hitting shots,” Heidegger said. “[…] We were getting the same quality shots all game, but there was a stretch there when they all just started going down, so that helped us increase the lead.”</p>\n<p>Another major catalyst was graduate transfer Leland King II. Playing without his usual frontcourt mate Canty, King was dominant Saturday night with 25 points, tied for his season-high, and 17 rebounds, his season-best outright.</p>\n<p>“The greatest rebounder I ever coached was Leon Powe at Cal […] and to me Leland’s a better rebounder than him,” Pasternak said. “[Powe] played for the Boston Celtics. Leland’s ranked number 12<sup>th</sup> in the country in rebounding […] To me, rebounding translates to the next level. I think he’s a pro, and he showed it tonight.”</p>\n<p>King controlled the game from the start, with a 10 point, 13 rebound double-double in the just the first half, but really turned on the offensive jets in the last 20 minutes. It was King that kickstarted UCSB’s game-sealing run with two straight buckets, including a running hook with 9:52 to go that pushed the forward past 1,000 points in his career.</p>\n<p>Ami Lakoju was Canty’s replacement as King’s partner in the starting frontcourt, and the 6-8 junior filled in admirably with 10 points and eight rebounds in 20 minutes. It was Lakoju who built on King’s two baskets by outmuscling two CSUN defenders and jamming a putback dunk in over their heads, pushing UCSB’s lead to 12 and electrifying the Thunderdome crowd.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game was particularly special to Lakoju, who was playing in front of his father for just the second time in his college career. The elder Lakoju, a minister and family counselor from Harlem, made the long trip to see his son play, an important boost for the junior.</p>\n<p>“It was a blessing to see him here,” Lakoju said. “He kind of surprised me with that visit but nonetheless I’m happy to see him here and for him to see us get two wins.</p>\n<p>Point guard Marcus Jackson followed up Lakoju’s dunk with two straight jumpers to stretch the lead to 16 points. Jackson, who has struggled with his shot recently, put up 12 points in the second half alone, an important development for the graduate transfer.</p>\n<p>“Marcus has been in kind of a shooting funk, and I wanted to give him some confidence,” Pasternak said. “[…] Sometimes it becomes mind over matter, so I wanted him to shoot. I started calling plays for him to get his confidence going. He hit a couple of shots and hopefully that’ll carry over.”</p>\n<p>Jackson had perhaps the team’s most balanced stat line of the night with 12 points, six rebounds and four assists. It was his corner three with 3:48 remaining that put the Gauchos up 68-44 and prompted Pasternak to begin emptying the UCSB bench.</p>\n<p>Playing without Canty, the Gauchos went to their bench earlier and more often than usual. Jarriesse Blackmon played 18 high-energy minutes, going 4-7 for eight points and six rebounds, while Christian Terrell dished out six assists without turning the ball over once in his 24 minutes.</p>\n<p>“I thought Jarriesse Blackmon gave us incredible energy,” Pasternak said. “To get that kind of contribution from him off the bench was really big for us.”</p>\n<p>The strong bench performances allowed Pasternak and his staff to give several starters lighter loads on Saturday. Gabe Vincent played just five minutes in the second half in order to rest a sore calf, and Max Heidegger was able to give his sore back a little bit more of a rest than it got in Thursday’s overtime marathon against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Whatever rest the Gauchos got on Saturday will be especially important come Thursday night, when UCSB travels to UC Davis to play for Big West supremacy. The Aggies pulled out a 105-104 victory over Long Beach State on Saturday night to keep pace with the Gauchos at 7-2, setting up a major clash next week.</p><div

On Saturday night against UC Riverside, the Gauchos almost did it again.</p>\n<p>Just two nights removed from a heartbreaking 80-79 loss to the Mustangs, the Gauchos picked up their first Big West win of the season against the Highlanders by a score of 65-57, pushing UCSB to 12-4 overall and 1-1 in league play.</p>\n<p>Eight minutes into their game against Cal Poly on Thursday, it seemed as though the Gauchos were destined to pick up their first league win in their first try. The Mustangs had no answer for UCSB, which jumped out to a 23-2 lead with 12:54 remaining in the first half.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The early Gaucho offensive explosion was driven by a balanced offensive attack. Six different players scored in that 23-2 run, and four players ended the first half with at least five points.</p>\n<p>The last ten minutes of the first half were markedly different from the first. Cal Poly ran off a 20-5 run at the end of the half to cut the Gaucho lead to 40-36 at halftime, as the hosts scored only eight points in the last eight minutes.</p>\n<p>While the first half was defined by two opposing runs, the second half was back-and-forth on a more microscopic level. With 13 lead changes in the second half alone, neither team was willing to let the other rest.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Jalen Canty had the hot hand in the second half, shooting 8-10 from the field for 17 points, one for each minute he played in the period. Sophomore guard Max Heidegger, normally the Gauchos’ most dependable and prolific scorer, was comparatively cold in going 2-10 for nine points in the last 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>For all his second half struggles, however, Heidegger made the shot his team needed him to. After Donovan Fields layup brought the Mustangs into a 77-77 tie, Heidegger buried a tough midrange jumper to give UCSB a 79-77 lead with exactly one second remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>Up two with just one clock tick to go, all the Gauchos had to do in order to secure their fourth win in a row and first in Big West play was to contest any last-second shot without fouling. They were unsuccessful in doing so.</p>\n<p>Fields, inbounding the ball, ran the baseline and hit Luke Meikle with a long pass over halfcourt. Meikle used his time wisely, getting Canty in the air with a pumpfake and drawing a three-shot foul with a desperation heave.</p>\n<p>Three clutch free throws and one missed full court shot later, and the Mustangs had completed their comeback in dramatic fashion with a 80-79 victory.</p>\n<p>Canty’s unfortunate foul didn’t diminish his standout performance on Thursday night. The forward led UCSB with 21 points and six blocks, and added 10 rebounds for his second double-double in a row.</p>\n<p>Leland King II was the Gauchos’ leading rebounder with 15 boards, his best rebounding performance of the season. King also had 12 points, giving him his third double-double in a row.</p>\n<p>Coming off such a brutal loss as the one they suffered on Thursday night, the Gauchos needed a strong bounce back showing on Saturday against the Highlanders. They got exactly that, thanks largely to a dominant game from King.</p>\n<p>The graduate transfer had 17 points in the first half alone on Saturday in the Thunderdome, and finished with 22 on the night. His 13 rebounds gave King his fourth double-double in a row, and helped the Gauchos overcome a quiet 2-point night from Jalen Canty.</p>\n<p>Neither team shot the ball particularly well from the field, as UCSB shot 39 percent while UCR shot 38 percent, but the Gauchos made up for it with 11 made threes on 28 attempts. Five of those threes came off the fingertips of Heidegger, who was second on the team with 19 points.</p>\n<p>Despite leading by 24 points with just 16 minutes to play, the Gauchos came close to blowing yet another massive lead. Riverside’s DJ Sylvester sank a layup with 5:06 remaining to make the score 56-51 but a couple of Heidegger three pointers boosted the lead back into more comfortable territory for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Highlander forward Alex Larsson was his team’s most efficient contributor with 10 points on 5-10 shooting, and his 11 rebounds gave the 6-10 senior a double-double of his own. Sylvester, at 4-13 from the field, was far less efficient, but still managed to lead Riverside with 13 points.</p>\n<p>After playing two games in three days, the Gauchos now get a whole week off in order to prepare for a road game in Hawaii on Saturday, when they’ll take on the Rainbow Warriors.

It was clear immediately that the Pioneers didn’t stand much of a chance of pulling off the upset.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held a 21-10 lead just ten minutes into the game, and managed to open up that advantage to 36-18 by halftime. Sophomore guard Max Heidegger led the Gaucho offense with 11 points in those first twenty minutes despite an uncharacteristically poor shooting performance, going 5-12 from the field and 1-5 from three in the first half.</p>\n<p>UCSB didn’t shoot particularly well from the field Saturday night, but that didn’t seem to matter much. The Gauchos shot 44 percent from the field, but were a shaky 26.1 percent from beyond the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Much of UCSB’s first half dominance can be attributed to its mastery of the boards. The Gauchos pulled down 36 first half rebounds to Pacific Union’s 15, with graduate transfer Leland King II leading the way with 11 rebounds in the first half for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Jalen Canty and sophomore guard Christian Terrell also got in on the rebound party, as both players grabbed seven boards in the first 20 minutes. Prior to Saturday’s game, Terrell’s season high for rebounds was seven, set back on Dec. 5 against Nebraska-Omaha.</p>\n<p>None of the Gauchos’ first-half starters played more than five minutes in the second half, but that doesn’t mean the hosts took their feet off the gas pedal. UCSB scored 45 points in the second half alone, and saw every player that entered the game score.</p>\n<p>J.D. Slajchert was one of those players, and the junior forward made the most of his season-high 10 minutes of play. Slajchert scored a season-best six points on 2-for-5 shooting, and knocked down one free throw.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos had nine players finish with at least five points, a balanced offensive attack that was key to their second-half scoring efforts. Heidegger’s 16 points led the way, but King II and Canty weren’t far behind with 10 each, as both players posted a double-double on the night as well.</p>\n<p>Jayson Marquez was Pacific Union’s only player in double-digit points Saturday night, although Rae Hubbard finished one point shy with nine points. Forward Noel Briones led all Pioneers with nine rebounds, third-best across both teams, but a 1-7 night from the field limited him to just two points.</p>\n<p>UCSB will attempt to stretch its three-game win streak out a bit more as it enters Big West play on Thursday, Jan. 4 at Cal Poly. The Mustangs are 5-9 on the season, but have a strong 85-82 loss to Cal on their resume.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take Cal Poly on Thursday night at 7:00 pm.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80339\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80339\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/","id":767,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[766,765,764],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sting Hornets With Double-Digit Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Things keep rolling for the Gauchos as they strung together another win Saturday night over Sac St. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_80287\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"601702107\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80337\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80287\" data-attachment-id=\"80287\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/christian-terrell-leaps-to-the-hoop-to-dunk-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-13-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christian Terrell leaps to the hoop to dunk.

That positive momentum was evident early on Saturday evening.</p>\n<p>Sacramento State eked out an early lead initially, thanks to a couple baskets from Izayah Mauriohooho-Le’afa. Before the Hornets could get too far ahead, however, the Gauchos reeled them back and grabbed the lead in with a couple of Leland King II three pointers, both assisted by Marcus Jackson.</p>\n<p>UCSB would never relinquish the advantage for the rest of Saturday’s game, but it took the team a while to open up a comfortable margin. Five points from Ami Lakoju, and another two assists from Jackson, pushed the Gauchos to a 20-14 lead, but the Hornets battled back to tie the game back up at 26 with six minutes to go in the first half.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, UCSB had managed to open up only a one-point lead at 31-30. Then, a Gabe Vincent jumpshot opened up the floodgates.</p>\n<p>Jackson was integral to the Gauchos’ half-closing 13-2 run. The graduate transfer knocked down two threes and set up Max Heidegger for a layup, all of which combined to give UCSB its first double-digit lead of the game at 41-30. One minute later, the horn sounded and the Gauchos decamped for the locker room with a 44-32 lead.</p>\n<p>A layup by Sac State’s Justin Patton kicked off the second-half scoring, and brought the Hornets to within ten, but that was as close as they would get for the majority of the last 20 minutes. The Gauchos kept their hosts at a consistent arms-reach throughout the period, never letting the margin grow too thin.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Jalen Canty shouldered the bulk of the UCSB offensive load in the second half. Canty scored all 15 of his points in the period, as he rebounded from a tough 0-4 first half to go 6-9 from the field in the second.</p>\n<p>Canty finished with nine rebounds to go with his 15 points, leaving him just one rebound shy of a double-double. His frontcourt mate Leland King II earned that distinction instead with his 11 points and 12 rebounds, his sixth such performance this season.</p>\n<p>Heidegger led all scorers Saturday with 23 points, an achievement that has become fairly wrote for the sophomore shooting guard at this point in the season. Heidegger benefited greatly from the vision and generosity of point guard Jackson, who finished with a game-high eight assists and 13 points.</p>\n<p>Sacramento State trailed by as much as 18 points in the second-half, but the Hornets hassled the Gauchos until the final horn.</p>\n<p>Jordan Tolbert and Justin Strings, with 13 and 14 points in the second half, respectively, were crucial in Sac State’s late game push to draw back within ten points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a week off before their next game, a home contest against Pacific Union at 7:00 pm. The Athletics are an NAIA squad, and are 2-7 this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80337\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80337\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-26/gauchos-sting-hornets-with-double-digit-win/","id":765,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[764,763,762],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Gets Back On Track With Victory Over San Diego Christian","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-12-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MBball_atUSC-171217-DustinHarris-09-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite its loss to USC, the UCSB men's basketball team overcame the defeat with a win over San Diego Christian.

Forwards Jalen Canty (12 points and six rebounds) and Leland King II (11 points and seven rebounds) broke the Hawks down from the inside in similarly limited minutes.</p>\n<p>For about four minutes, it seemed as though UCSB had fallen into the trap of overlooking San Diego Christian. The Hawks stayed level with the Gauchos, even taking a 10-8 lead on a pair of Derek Novsek free throws.</p>\n<p>Two more Novsek free throws got the Hawks to 12 points, but those free throws came four minutes later, at the 12:13 mark. In the interim, UCSB had jetted off on an 18-0 run to claim a lead they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>Heidegger’s 19 first-half points were key to UCSB’s performance in the first twenty minutes, as the sophomore was twelve points ahead of any other scorer on the floor in the half. Senior guard Gabe Vincent was a strong second option with eight points and three assists in his 13 minutes of first-half action.</p>\n<p>The margin stayed about the same from that point until halftime, which the Gauchos went into holding a 50-33 lead. Immediately upon returning from the intermission, however, UCSB broke the game well and truly open.</p>\n<p>Playing with primarily second-unit players, the Gauchos extended their lead to 77-44 by about the ten-minute mark. Forward Ami Lakoju was particularly instrumental in UCSB’s second-half dominance, as the junior chipped in 12 points, tied for his career-high, and five rebounds in just 14 minutes of action.</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Brandon Davis saw an extra-heavy dose of playing time thanks to the blowout as well as a night off for point guard Marcus Jackson, and Davis responded with a career-high nine points on 4-for-6 shooting.</p>\n<p>A 33-point lead with less than ten minutes to go is more or less an unbridgeable chasm of a lead, but the Hawks did their absolute best to string that bridge together. San Diego Christian closed the game on a 23-6 run to bring the deficit back under 20, but was ultimately unable to truly threaten UCSB’s cushion.</p>\n<p>San Diego’s Novsek and Frederick Hayden led all scorers with 21 and 22 points, respectively. Both players scored ten points in the second half alone, providing the dual scoring threats the Hawks needed to claw back within 20 points of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB travels north to take on Sacramento State on Saturday in Sacramento at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80336\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80336\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-23/ucsb-gets-back-on-track-with-victory-over-san-diego-christian/","id":205,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[204,203,202],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ruddins’s Rise to the Top; Gauchos’ Star Overcomes Setbacks","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Being a star athlete isn't always full of successes and enjoyment.

She’s also had to deal with three difficult years for the team, which has never finished higher than fourth place in her time with UCSB’s program.</p>\n<p>But Ruddins hasn’t faltered, despite the injuries and the losses. Instead, she has excelled, and she is as optimistic as she’s ever been going into next season.</p>\n<p>Given what she’s gone through as a UCSB athlete, such optimism is surprising. Ruddins lost almost all of her true freshman year to an abdominal injury, which forced her to medically redshirt the majority of the season.</p>\n<p>“I had previously torn my [abdominal] in my senior year of high school,” she said. “I played on it for a little and then it strained again and it was continuously bothering me. It was definitely hard, and we had lots of meetings about it, but I’m happy with my choice to take the year to recover.”</p>\n<p>That year off turned out to be a blessing for Ruddins and for the UCSB team. The outside hitter used her recovery time to acclimate to the college game and get ready for her return.</p>\n<p>“The college game is so different than high school and club,” Ruddins said. “Being able to get a full year under my belt of just knowing the schedule and having to watch video and do scouting for the first time and stuff like that, it kind of gave me an upper hand as a freshman in my sophomore year.”</p>\n<p>Ruddins didn’t let the knowledge she soaked up while off the court go to waste, as she took the nation by storm her first full year on the court as a redshirt freshman.</p>\n<p>Her 4.09 kills were tops on the team and the fourth best of any freshman in the country in 2016, and she recorded a team-high eight double-doubles (kills and digs).</p>\n<p>Her end-of-season awards list was lengthy, with the Big West Freshman of the Year award and a spot on the AVCA All-American Honorable Mention list serving as the highlights.</p>\n<p>That season was also UCSB’s best, as it went 13-3 in Big West play in 2013 to earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. The Gauchos went 17-12 overall and 8-8 in the Big West, finishing in fourth place in the conference.</p>\n<p>Ruddins had overcome a major obstacle and established herself as a rising star. Then, injuries reared their ugly head once again.</p>\n<p>During a practice in mid-September of her redshirt freshman season, Ruddins came down hard on a teammate’s foot and rolled her ankle. She only missed two matches that season as a result but underwent reconstructive ankle surgery in the offseason.</p>\n<p>That made for two major injuries for Ruddins in only two seasons, a terrible enough ratio to raise serious doubts toward her returning to the court. Ruddins, however, was ready to recover and rally once again.</p>\n<p>“I’ve suffered through many injuries in my career, unfortunately,” Ruddins said. “Coming back from that is always tough, but I love volleyball and I feel like volleyball has made me pretty mentally strong.”</p>\n<p>For the second time in her collegiate career, Ruddins underwent the grueling process of rehab. She spent her offseason in physical therapy, working with trainer Bob Annable to rebuild her ankle and get herself back into playing shape.</p>\n<p>In a sport as dynamic as volleyball, injuries are just a part of the game. That’s especially true for outside hitters, who spend as much time in the air as any other player on the court.</p>\n<p>In a way, then, the injuries were hardly a surprise to Ruddins, who hails from a volleyball family and has spent a major chunk of her life playing the sport.</p>\n<p>“My aunt [Kim Ruddins] actually played for USC and in the Olympics, and then my dad played for Long Beach, so it was kind of in my family,” Lindsey said. “My older sister started playing club volleyball in eighth grade, but we had always kind of played with my dad and aunt.”</p>\n<p>Ruddins credits her older sister, Elise, for providing the most direct inspiration for taking up volleyball. The elder Ruddins sister wound up following in her aunt’s footsteps and played on the USC team.</p>\n<p>“[Elise] was actually getting offers her freshman year of high school,” Ruddins said. “It was so fun watching her, and then I started playing.”</p>\n<p>Just like her older sister, Lindsey Ruddins started getting noticed by colleges in her freshman year of high school, but she was drawn toward blazing her own trail to UCSB.</p>\n<p>The third and final Ruddins sister, Gail, will follow that trail next season, giving the Ruddins family two Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Gail Ruddins will be joining a UCSB team coming off an up-and-down season marked with a mixture of highs and lows. For Lindsey Ruddins, however, the season was mostly highs.</p>\n<p>The redshirt sophomore was quiet in her first match back, posting just eight kills in a three-set loss to Illinois State to start the season. That match quickly proved to be an outlier, however.</p>\n<p>A match against Florida State the next day saw Ruddins post a match-high 36 kills as well as 18 digs for her first double-double of the season. That match was also the beginning of Ruddins’s double-digit kill streak, which will continue into next season.</p>\n<p>Most notably, the star outside hitter set a rally-scoring era record for single-match kills with 36, falling two kills short of tying former Gaucho Roberta Gehlke’s school record 38 kills against Long Beach State on Sept. 30, 1999.</p>\n<p>Ruddins was a terror throughout non-conference play, posting four double-doubles in eight matches. However, none of those double-doubles turned into wins for the Gauchos, who won only one of their non-conference matches and entered Big West play with a 1-11 record.</p>\n<p>“[The season] definitely started off rough, you could say,” Ruddins said. “We had four freshmen and a transfer come in, and they came into a team that had been through so much. They all tried from the very beginning and wanted to get better and showed improvement. As a team, our rough preseason just made us work harder.”</p>\n<p>Life got a little easier for UCSB once Big West matches started up. The Gauchos went 7-9 in their conference and played Cal Poly, the eventual league champions, in a close match in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>“Towards the end of the year, things finally started to come together,” Ruddins said. “I’m super excited for next year.”</p>\n<p>Ruddins’s dominance, on the other hand, continued unabated. The outside hitter had eight double-doubles in Big West competition and ran off three in a row to close out the season.</p>\n<p>Her rate of 6.30 kills per set in conference play was the best of any Big West player and almost two kills better than the next closest attacker.</p>\n<p>Such strong performance garnered plenty of attention, both regionally and nationally. Ruddins won four Big West Women’s Volleyball Player of the Week awards during the 2017 season and earned a spot on the All-Big West First Team.</p>\n<p>Nationally, Ruddins was named AVCA National Player of the Week in October on the strength of a three-match killing spree against UC Davis, Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Given her position atop the kills-per-set leaderboard, it’s likely she will be named to the AVCA All-American First Team as well.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of accolades for one person. Nevertheless, Ruddins doesn’t think too much of it all.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, it’s nothing,” the outside hitter said. “It’s not an award for me, it’s for our team. I’ve gotten awards before and it’s cool to get the recognition, but it’s not just me.”</p>\n<p>Ruddins might not be too impressed with her own play, but most observers are, especially considering what she’s overcome to earn those awards. Not only do the Gauchos have the best attacker in the nation, they might just have the toughest.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Dec. 7</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80078\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80078\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ruddinss-rise-to-the-top-gauchos-star-overcomes-setbacks/","id":4935,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4934,4933,4932],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":6,"route":"/authors/17"}},"__N_SSG":true}
