Two losses, and UCSB will likely find itself in third or fourth place, facing a much more difficult path to the championship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily for the Gauchos, the two teams they have left to play are two of the worst teams in the Big West: Cal State Fullerton, which is 10-19 overall and 5-9 in conference play, and Cal Poly, which is 7-21 and 4-10.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That scheduling luck is a bit misleading, however. Fullerton and Cal Poly do indeed reside at the bottom of the conference standings, but that just means they have more to play for. The worst team in the Big West misses the tournament entirely and the Titans and Mustangs both will do what it takes to avoid that fate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos, then, host two hungry teams this week. First up is Fullerton on Thursday night followed by Cal Poly on Saturday night, which will also serve as Senior Night for UCSB’s three departing players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB defeated Fullerton on Feb. 20 in a 75-66 game that saw the Gauchos come out hot, then blow the lead, and finally regain the advantage and close out the Titans with a 16-3 run. Senior guard Max Heidegger provided much of the spark for UCSB with 27 points, 7 rebounds 5 five assists and scored 16 of the team’s 41 second-half points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos likely won’t have Heidegger this time around. The senior left last Thursday’s game against UC Riverside early with an ankle injury that was serious enough to keep him out of Saturday’s game against UC Irvine as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB felt Heidegger’s absence in their loss to UC Irvine, shooting just 36.8% from the field with only one player scoring in the double digits. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin handled much of the scoring load when Heidegger missed 10 games earlier this season and will likely have to take on that role again if the Gauchos are to overcome the loss of their leading scorer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s game was a tough first matchup to be without a player like Heidegger, but if the senior is indeed forced to miss more time with his injury, the competition this week promises to be a bit friendlier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton is a middle-of-the-pack defensive team in the Big West, surrendering the fourth-most points per game while holding opponents to the fourth-lowest shooting percentage in the league. The Gauchos’ experience in their first matchup with the Titans bears out the statistical observations: UCSB shot a solid 45.6% from the field and scored 75 points, both fairly typical totals for the team this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On offense, Fullerton has two of the top five scorers in the Big West in senior guard Brandon Kamga and senior forward Jackson Rowe. Kamga and Rowe combined for 38 of the Titans’ 66 points in their first game against UCSB and will almost certainly be the Gauchos’ top defensive priorities once again on Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton comes into Thursday’s game as losers of their last three games and have slid perilously close to last place Cal Poly in the Big West standings. UCSB, on the other hand, has won six of their last eight games, so the two teams enter Thursday’s game heading in opposite directions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same can be said for Cal Poly and UCSB. The Mustangs have lost five games in a row heading into their matchup with the Gauchos, a losing streak that has kept them in the Big West cellar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and Cal Poly opened up Big West play against each other all the way back on Jan. 8, so it’s only fitting that they’ll close their regular season against each other almost two months later. That first matchup was a 63-45 Gaucho victory, the team’s second-most lopsided win in conference play this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statistically speaking, there’s not much that Cal Poly does especially well. The Mustangs are near the bottom of the Big West in several categories, on offense and defense, and have surrendered over 80 points six times in conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs are especially weak on the boards, as opponents average 4.4 more rebounds a game than Cal Poly. That’s the worst mark in the Big West and UCSB will be eager to exploit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Heidegger is forced to miss Saturday’s game as well, it won’t be much of a change for the Gauchos when it comes to playing Cal Poly. The senior guard missed the Jan. 8 matchup as well, and while the team’s 63 points don’t scream success, the margin of victory suggests UCSB knows how to beat Cal Poly without their leading scorer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mustangs have just one player averaging over 10 points per game: sophomore guard Junior Ballard. Ballard averages 12.8 points per game and shoots 36%  percent from three, enough to make him the primary focus for any team playing Cal Poly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Mustangs are able to reverse their slide and beat Long Beach State on Thursday night, they’ll come into the Thunderdome with a potential postseason bid on the line. If not, there won’t be much to play for, other than a shot at spoiling UCSB’s shot at second place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos host CSU Fullerton on Thursday night at 7 p.m. On Saturday night, the Gauchos host Cal Poly for Senior Night, also at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

for the UC Santa Barbara men’s basketball team is protecting its seeding heading into the Big West Tournament.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winners of five of their last six games, the Gauchos appear poised to do just that. The team will have to learn from its early-season mistakes, however.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB entered Big West play on a similar roll, but saw a six-game winning streak melt away into a 2-4 conference record. These Gauchos know the importance of not coasting or resting on past success, and that their knowledge will be tested this week.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First up on the schedule is UC Riverside on the road on Thursday, followed by an away game at league-leader UC Irvine on Saturday. UCSB has already beaten both teams in close games at the Thunderdome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside is 15-14 overall and 5-8 in conference play, which has the team second-to-last in the Big West. The Highlanders fell 65-63 to the Gauchos in a late January  thriller that saw senior guard Max Heidegger drill a go-ahead three with 2.9 seconds remaining in the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger  has been flying high as of late, along with his team. The senior won Big West Player of the Week honors for his play last week, as he averaged 22 points and 4.5 rebounds and assists per game in UCSB’s wins over Cal State Fullerton and UC Davis.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCR has seen middling success overall, but they’ve been a different team at home. The Highlanders are 10-4  in the Student Recreation Center Arena in Riverside and fell just 4 points short of a home upset against UC Irvine earlier this month. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They had Irvine beat,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “They were up 7 with about 4 points to go at home versus Irvine. They’re really good at home. We went there last year and got beat. It’s a tough place to play.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Riverside plays at an agonizingly slow pace, the 12th slowest in the country according to Fox Sports, which helps explain its last-place position in the Big West for points per game and first-place position for points allowed per game. UCSB, however, isn’t much faster at 17th slowest in the country but yet still manages to be fourth in the conference in points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re the ninth-slowest team in our league [out of 9],” Pasternack  said. “They grind it out and it’s a grind every single game against them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big benches are often the province of up-tempo teams, but UCR bucks that trend with 12 out of 13 rostered players playing at least 10 minutes per game. UCSB, on the other hand, plays only nine of its 12 players double-digit minutes per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Highlanders don’t just have a big bench; they’ve got big players, too. Sophomore center Callum McRae is the biggest at 7’1”, but redshirt sophomore big-man Angus McWilliam  and redshirt junior forward Arinze Chidom both clock in at over 6’9” themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re a big, big team,” Pasternack  said. “They do a great job of game-planning and scouting […] We’re going to have to do a great job, all five players, of rebounding.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat UCR’s size, Pasternack  plans to play Gaucho sophomore forward Amadou Sow and junior forward Robinson Idehen at the same time on Thursday. That’s been a rare sight so far this season and could take some getting used to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB last faced UCR during a low point in their season, after losing three straight games in early Big West play. The Gauchos played from behind for almost all of that first game, but the team’s recent success suggests Thursday could be a different story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After UC Riverside, UCSB takes on UC Irvine in a marquee Big West matchup.  The crown jewel of the Gauchos’ current string of wins is a 64-61 victory over the Anteaters on Feb. 8,  a game Irvine likely hasn’t forgotten.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB won that game despite blowing a 41-24 second-half lead in front of their home crowd. UCI roared back from the deficit to take a 58-55 lead late in the game, but the Gauchos managed to right the ship and close out their conference rivals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A similar performance on Saturday probably won’t cut it against a team that has been almost unbeatable on its home court. The Anteaters are 10-1 in Irvine, the one loss an upset at the hands of Cal Baptist early in the season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conference play, UCI has lost to only UCSB and Long Beach State and has won its last four games heading into a Thursday matchup with last-place Cal Poly.  A win on Thursday will clinch the regular-season title for the Anteaters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI is second best in the Big West in points scored and points allowed per game, which is always a deadly combination. As the Feb. 8 game showed, the Anteaters’ overall strength means they’re never really out of contention in any game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters have three players averaging at least 12 points per game: redshirt sophomore forward Collin Welp, senior guard Evan Leonard and senior point guard Eyassu Worku. Welp averages 6 rebounds a game, while Worku  hands out a team-best 3.9 assists per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A win on Saturday will be a difficult task for the Gauchos, but they have already proved that they are capable of it this season. UCSB’s case will be greatly aided if the team manages to avoid another massive second-half collapse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beating UCR will help solidify the Gauchos’ second-place standing in the Big West and beating UCI will give the team a burst heading into the postseason. Two wins will send a strong message to the rest of the conference that this UCSB team is ready to play deep into March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos travel to Riverside to take on the Highlanders on Thursday at 7 p.m. and then swing over to Irvine to play the Anteaters on Saturday, also at 7 p.m. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

in their season this week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two games on the docket, the first on Thursday at Cal State Fullerton and the second being a home rematch on Saturday against UC Davis, the Gauchos had the opportunity to bounce back and improve their positioning in the conference standings. UCSB took that opportunity and swept the week with a 75-66 win over the Titans and a 70-56 victory over the Aggies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two wins pushed the Gauchos’ record to 18-9 this season and 7-5 in conference play.

Slowly and surely, Fullerton dragged their way into contention, at one point narrowing the UCSB lead to 2 points and went into the locker room down by 34-29.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos maintained their advantage for the much of the second half but were unable to reopen their lead into the double-digits. Fullerton kept on hanging around, waiting for the opportunity to make their move.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That opportunity finally presented itself just after the eight-minute mark of the second half. The Titans stitched together the right combination of buckets and stops and took a 56-55 lead, their first of the game, with 7:34 to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baskets from each of Fullerton’s top three players — senior forward Jackson Rowe, graduate transfer guard Brandon Kamga and senior guard Austen Awosika — pushed the Titan lead to 63-59 with 5:40 left and forced UCSB onto its back foot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos responded to the reversal of fortunes with vigor. UCSB closed out the game on a 16-3 run for the 75-66 victory, giving the game a symmetrical appearance with Gaucho runs to open and close the proceedings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Max Heidegger scored 8 of UCSB’s final 16 points and finished with a game-high 27 points. Heidegger also pulled down 7 rebounds and passed out 5 assists, making for a well-rounded performance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger’s 7 boards tied him with junior guard Devearl Ramsey for a team-high rebound count. Neither Heidegger, at 6’3”, or Ramsey, at 6’ even, have anything resembling a height advantage on the glass, but both guards found a way to find the ball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday’s matchup was the first between UCSB and Fullerton this season, giving the Gauchos their first chance to take on the team that knocked them out of the Big West Tournament last season. While the Titans are a much different team this season than they were last year, the element of revenge likely made the win just a little sweeter for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revenge was also at play on Saturday night against UC Davis. The Aggies came into the Thunderdome on a four-game winning streak, including an 84-75 win over UCSB last Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos came out of the gate looking like a team intent on vengeance — perhaps a little too intent. UCSB committed 6 turnovers in the first eight minutes of the game, enabling UCD to jump out to an early 14-6 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like we were just a little anxious,” Ramsey said. “We just wanted to get out there and play really hard and we just had to channel our energy in the right way.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took a few minutes, but the Gauchos eventually managed to settle down and stop giving the ball away. Once that happened, UCSB was able to chip away, slowly but surely, at the Davis lead with good defense and some solid interior play by sophomore forward Amadou Sow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tip-in by junior guard Brandon Cyrus and a jumper by Heidegger brought the Gauchos within 2 points of the Aggies and forced UCD Head Coach Jim Les to call a timeout with 7:15 left in the half. That timeout did nothing to stop the Davis slide, however.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies turned the ball over immediately out of the timeout and suddenly, Ramsey  was everywhere. The point guard knocked down a 3, made a layup and knocked down another 3, all in the span of about 70 seconds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My teammates were just finding me, and in transition, I’m always going to try to push the pace,” Ramsey said. “Amadou had me on the skip [pass] and Max had me on the skip [pass]; those guys got me and I just hit my shots.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ramsey’s one-man run pushed UCSB into the lead with 5:28 to go in the first half and energized the Thunderdome crowd. Freeman knocked down 2 free throws a few minutes later to make the score 31-21, but a couple of scores by Aggie senior guard Joe Mooney cut the deficit to 31-26 going into the locker room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neither the Gauchos nor the Aggies were able to break away from the other for most of the second half. UCSB held onto their lead, but UCD managed to answer seemingly every basket or stop with one of their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just under seven minutes left, the Gauchos managed to stitch together another run — their first real spurt of the half. After UC Davis freshman guard Ezra Manjon knocked down 2 free throws to cut the lead to 54-50, UCSB worked the ball inside: big man Sow scored twice and Heidegger flipped in a layup to push the lead to double digits for the first time in the half. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Les immediately called a timeout and, unlike his earlier timeout, this one managed to flip the momentum, at least for a little bit. Junior forward Kennedy Koehler scored 3 straight times  to bring his team back within 4 points of the lead, putting some serious pressure on the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB responded with overwhelming force. Heidegger struck back first with a deep 3 from straightaway, and it was all Gauchos from there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Koehler’s last layup in his personal mini-run was UC Davis’ last point of the night, and it came with 4:18 left on the clock. The Aggies were wholly unable to get a bucket from that point on, while UCSB poured on 10 straight points to close out the 14-point win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the end of regulation wasn’t particularly exciting, with the Gauchos holding such a commanding lead, the postgame handshake line had plenty of drama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, Les appeared to pass Pasternack without a handshake and then yelled back at the Gaucho head coach. As Les was yelling, Mooney ran up behind Heidegger and shoved the Gaucho guard in the back, setting off a shoving match at center court that took a while to finally clear up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasternack didn’t provide an explanation of what exactly happened, but he did have plenty of praise for Les.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not sure [what was going on],” Pasternack said. “I think Coach Les is one of the best coaches in the country. I think he is very, very hard to beat. His teams execute as well as any team I’ve ever coached against in my career.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger led all scorers with 17 points, but Sow wasn’t far behind with 16 of his own. The second-year big had 6 rebounds and 2 blocks and made his presence felt against an undersized UC Davis team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, it was a guard cleaning up the boards for UCSB, but this time it was Cyrus with a team-high 8 rebounds. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin, meanwhile, led the Gauchos with 7 assists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up for UCSB is a Thursday matchup against UC Riverside, who is currently second-to-last in the Big West, and then a Saturday game at UC Irvine. The Anteaters sit comfortably atop the Big West at 11-2, but the Gauchos stole their crown the last time the two teams met with a 64-61 victory.</span></p><div

in the Big West at 5-5, the UC Santa Barbara men’s basketball team has two chances this week to move up the ladder. The team also has two chances at revenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday evening, the Gauchos travel to take on Cal State Fullerton (CSUF) on the road before quickly returning to the Thunderdome to host UC Davis (UCD) on Saturday. The Titans bounced UCSB from the Big West Tournament last season, and the Aggies handed the Gauchos their most recent loss last Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal State Fullerton team this season is quite different from the one that ended UCSB’s season last year. Both of the Titans’ leading scorers from last season are gone and playing professional ball in Europe, leaving Jackson Rowe, Brandon Kamga and Austen Awosika behind to handle much of the offensive load.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rowe was Fullerton’s third-leading scorer last season and has picked up where he left off from last year. The senior forward missed the first 13 games of the season with a knee injury but is averaging a team-leading 15.6 points on 42.4% three-point shooting since his return.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kamga is just a tick behind Rowe at 15.2 points per game overall this season but is averaging a team-high 19 points per game in conference play. Kamga, a graduate transfer from High Point University, is new to the Fullerton program but seems to have acclimated quite well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kamga […] is probably second in our league to [Cal State Northridge’s (CSUN)] Lamine Diane,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “He does a great, great job of getting baskets.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Senior guard Awosika brings up the rear of the scoring triumvirate with 13.5 points per game, but he chips in 4 rebounds and a team-best 4.0 assists per game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Titans are 10-16 overall this season, but they’re just a half-game behind the Gauchos in the Big West at 5-6. Thursday’s game isn’t just a chance for UCSB to avenge last year’s loss — it’s an opportunity for Fullerton to move up the ladder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re the team that knocked us out in the conference tournament,” Pasternack said. “They’re always a very good team. The league is so well rounded. The parity is amazing. On any given night, anybody can beat anybody.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fullerton has compiled a record that proves Pasternack’s point. The Titans have lost to the Big West’s two last-place teams, Cal Poly and UC Riverside and have beaten UC Davis and CSUN, both tied for second. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, but Fullerton also upset UCLA earlier this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to know exactly what to expect from the Titans, but recent history suggests a lot of offense is likely. In six of CSUF’s last seven games, at least one team has scored over 70 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos don’t have much time to recover from Thursday’s game before they take on UC Davis at home on Saturday night. The two teams just met last Thursday, when the Aggies won 84-75 in a game more lopsided than the score would indicate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB couldn’t buy a bucket in the first half, shooting just 36% to Davis’ 50% mark. The Aggies took full advantage of the Gauchos’ slow start and rocketed out to a 36-24 halftime lead that they never fully relinquished[[ok]].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Credit to Davis, they played a great game,” Pasternack said. “They were very well-prepared. All credit goes to them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only senior guard Max Heidegger’storrid second half, which saw him score 27 of his 31 points and knock down seven 3’s, kept UCSB in contention. Heidegger’s explosion aside, it was a dispiriting result for a Gaucho team that had been riding a three-game win streak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, UCSB will get the chance to bounce back from last week’s loss and land a serious blow against one of the team’s main Big West rivals. Thursday’s game pushed UCD past the Gauchos and up to second place in the conference at 6-5 and 12-15 overall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pasternack has been working his charges hard in practice this week in order to right the ship, and Thursday and Saturday’s games will test the effectiveness of his efforts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our guys have worked extremely hard,” Pasternack said. “It’s ‘next game.’ That’s the mentality. We lost a game, didn’t play well. They played really well, and now it’s on us to really lock in here and get ready for Thursday night.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The regular season is rapidly approaching its close, and the number of opportunities to move up the bracket for the Big West tournament is dwindling. The Gauchos get two opportunities this week to make a move up the standings and avenge a pair of losses — opportunities the team likely can’t afford to waste.</span></p><div

The Anteaters’ size was too much for the Aggies, whom they outscored 74-30 in the paint and outrebounded by a combined total of 25 rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sow will get his chance to do similar damage on Thursday night in Davis. The sophomore is coming off of a dominant week that saw him set a career high for points with 30 in the Hawai’i game and then followed that up with a 21-point, 10-rebound performance against UC Irvine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Amadou has done a great job,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “He’s had some poor basketball games, and he’s done an amazing job of recovering, and I’m really happy for him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Davis’ lack of size presents opportunities not just for the Gaucho big men, but for the guards as well. Senior Max Heidegger and junior JaQuori McLaughlin both excel at getting inside and finishing at the rim, and they should have plenty of opportunities to do so against an Aggie team that blocks a Big West-worst 1.8 shots a game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they don’t block very many shots, UCD does boast some of the quickest hands on the West Coast. The Aggies average 6.1 steals per game this season and have forced a conference-best 14.2 turnovers per game in conference play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC Davis is number one in the conference at forcing turnovers,” Pasternack said. “That’s their best thing they do. They really do a great job of defending the three and forcing turnovers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other end of the court, UC Davis tends to live and die by the 3-pointer. The Aggies are shooting a stunning 40.1% from 3-point land in conference play, and they lead the Big West with 79 made 3-pointers against conference opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Matchups are very hard [against UC Davis],” Pasternack said. “They’re very small, and they can really shoot the ball. We’re going to be challenged to defend the three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Stefan Gonzalez isn’t just UCD’s top sniper; he’s one of the best shooters in the country. Gonzalez is third in the NCAA with a .479 3-point field goal percentage and makes about three 3-pointers a game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Gonzalez is clicking, and he has been in pretty much every game this season, there’s not much the opposing team can do but relentlessly deny him the ball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez’s fellow senior guard Joe Mooney is UC Davis’ leading scorer with 13.2 points per game, although he’s scored in the single digits in five of his last six games. Freshman point guard Ezra Manjon has stepped up instead with 15.4 points per game in Big West play while averaging 4.2 assists per game over that same time span.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aggies have won two of their last three games, with the most recent win an 87-81 victory over Cal State Fullerton that saw sophomore forward Caleb Fuller explode for a career-high 23 points. UCD’s 4-5 conference record is somewhat middling but is just a game back of UCSB for third place in the Big West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Gauchos, the task on Thursday evening will be to keep the Aggies from doing too much damage from behind the 3-point line and to stay steady after three wins in a row. The winning streak and the feeling of beating two of the Big West’s best in Hawai’i and UC Irvine is undoubtedly intoxicating, but UC Davis won’t be forgiving if UCSB gets too cocky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every single game has a different life of its own,” Pasternack said. “We just have to keep playing team basketball and sharing the basketball and getting assists and defending.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos are far from a Goliath, even with three wins in a row, but they’d still do well to follow that prescription when they take on the David-sized UC Davis team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB plays UC Davis in Davis on Thursday at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Gauchos took a 35-33 lead into halftime but shot just 36% from the field in the second half and allowed Hawai’i to take command with an 11-2 run after halftime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s blowout win over LBSU last week had a similar background story: The Gauchos blew a first-half lead with an ice-cold second half the first time they played the Beach. A similar rebound against Hawai’i will be a tougher proposition than it was against Long Beach, but the precedent is there.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to do a great job of executing on offense,” Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. “Hawai’i’s very good at defending and they really make you move the ball side to side. That’s a credit to their defense and we have to do a great job on offense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Eddie Stansberry leads the Rainbow Warriors with 17 points per game and garnered Big West Player of the Week honors last week thanks to a 22-point performance in a win over CSUN. UCSB kept Stansberry quiet with just 6 points the first time the two teams met, a defensive performance the Gauchos would do well to repeat on Thursday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Stansberry] is a great player,” Pasternack said. “I’m sure he’s going to come out firing on all cylinders, so we’re going to have to do a great job again of defending him, not just with one guy but with multiple defenders.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While UCSB managed to keep Stansberry from doing significant damage back in January, the team instead died a death of a thousand cuts. No Rainbow Warrior scored more than 12 points, but all but one scored at least 5.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That balanced attack proved too much for the Gauchos to match, but the team could have stood a chance had it been able to shoot in the second half. If the LBSU game last week is any indication, the UCSB offense may be rounding into form just in time to avenge that second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday’s game will be at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome and broadcast on Big West TV. One attendee will be picked to get a chance to make a half-court shot to win a free car at halftime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever happens on Thursday, the Gauchos won’t have much time to rest and reload. Reigning Big West champion UC Irvine will visit on Saturday after playing UC Davis on Thursday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters have continued their winning ways in the Big West this season. UCI has lost just one of seven conference games, although the one loss was an upset at the hands of middling LBSU.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irvine had won 16 Big West games in a row before the loss to LBSU, a streak dating back to Jan. 16, 2019. The Beach held the Anteaters to a 33.8% performance from the field and kept UCI in the rearview mirror with wave after wave of scoring runs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loss to LBSU was the first game in a mini swoon for the Anteaters, who beat Cal Poly by just 7 points three days later at home. Those two games aside, Irvine has won every Big West game by double digits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI’s most recent conquest was a 91-61 drubbing of Cal State Fullerton last Saturday, although the team will play UC Davis on Thursday before traveling to UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anteaters don’t have one dominant scorer on offense, but they have several capable bucket-getters. Redshirt sophomore forward Collin Welp leads the team with 13.9 points per game and is second on UCI with 6.6 rebounds per game, despite starting only two games this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior point guard Eyassu Worku plays the most minutes of any Anteater — 28.4 per game — and is second on the team with 12.1 points per game. Worku directs the UCI offense with a team-leading 4 assists per game and has also knocked down 42% of his 3-pointers on just under 4 attempts per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCI leads the Big West with 40.8 rebounds per game and has seven players averaging at least 3 rebounds per game. UCSB, however, allows just 28.9 rebounds per game, also a Big West-best.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday, then, will be a Newtonian clash of force and object. The Gauchos shoot a conference-best 46.8% from the field — which limits rebounding opportunities for opponents — but they’ll still have their hands full trying to keep the Anteaters off the boards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rebounding and victory have often gone hand in hand for UCSB this season, and that formula likely won’t change on Saturday. First, the Gauchos will have to find a way to replicate LBSU’s success and keep UCI’s shooting percentages low and then they’ll have to clean up on the boards in order to be competitive and take down the kings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s game will be broadcast by ESPNU and will take place at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</span></p><div

The team shot almost 60% from the field in the second half and went 6-11 on 3-pointers, all while holding LBSU to 35 points and 40% from the field in the half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s win moved UCSB to 14-8 this season and 3-4 in Big West play.

Freeman finished with a season-high 24 points and seemed almost incapable of missing, going 9-11 on field goals and 6-7 on 3-pointers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman had struggled offensively in the games leading up to Saturday. The former Oklahoma Sooner hadn’t cracked double-digit points yet in 2020, but the turn of the calendar to February seemed to rejuvenate the stretch big .</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only flaw of Freeman’s game on Saturday was foul trouble, but even that was just a small roadblock. Limited to only six minutes in the second half, Freeman still managed to pour in 13 points on 5-5 shooting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos hardly skipped a beat, even with Freeman’s hot hand forced to take a seat. Senior guard Max Heidegger stepped up with 12 points and 7 assists in the second half and finished with a near triple-double of 14 points, 11 assists and 9 rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore big man Amadou Sow dominated the boards all game and finished with 14 total rebounds, 7 on offense and 7 on defense. Sow did most of his damage in the first half, but his presence inside helped open up opportunities for UCSB’s shooters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos helped their own case on offense by taking care of the ball better than they had all year. UCSB committed a season-low 8 turnovers and passed out 22 assists, tied for a season high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ball movement, hot shooting, post presence and a 21-24 team performance at the free-throw line all contributed to the 87-point performance, the Gauchos’ second-best scoring output this season. The 25-point margin of victory was UCSB’s largest of the season, a credit to the defense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach State shot just 36.2% and committed 12 turnovers, which became 15 points for UCSB. The Beach didn’t shoot much better the first time they clashed with UCSB, but the Gauchos were a paltry 32% on their field goal tries that first time around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took UCSB over five minutes to crack double digits, and the two teams stayed more-or-less neck and neck throughout the first half, which ended with the Gauchos up 32-27. Both teams made just around a third of their shots, but Sow’s rebounding and Freeman’s shooting helped UCSB stay just ahead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half was the Matt Freeman show from the first possession. Freeman scored on four of the Gauchos’ first six possessions and tallied 11 points in the first three and a half minutes of second-half action.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aforementioned foul trouble forced Freeman to the bench in short order, but the damage was done. UCSB opened up an 11-point lead in those three and a half minutes, and LBSU never managed to close the gap again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB gets a few days off before hosting two games against the Big West’s best next week. The first is a Thursday matchup against Hawaii at 7 p.m. and the second is a Saturday game against UC Irvine, also at 7 p.m.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Since the sophomore returned, the Matadors are 5-3, with a 2-2 record in the Big West. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those conference losses came at the hands of Cal Poly, which has otherwise struggled in Big West play so far. The Mustangs managed to hold Lamine to just 12 points and blew the Matadors out 74-56. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only did Cal Poly limit Diane to just 12 points on 45% shooting, they also limited him to 26 minutes of action. The forward fouled out with nine and a half minutes to go in the second half thanks to 4 fouls in the second half alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foul trouble has been a trend all season for Diane and especially in the last four games of Big West action. If the Gauchos can get Diane into foul trouble and on the bench, they’ll be facing a severely weakened Matador team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, stopping Diane and the CSUN offense will also require success on the defensive side. To that end, Pasternack plans to rely on a wide array of players and strategies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re going to have a multitude of guys guarding [Diane],” Pasternack said. “From guards to forwards to centers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB defense can’t sell out to stop Diane entirely, however. The Matadors also boast sophomore guard Terrell Gomez, who’s averaging 20.9 points per game and knocking down 41% of his 3-pointers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Gomez is just as dangerous as [Diane],” Pasternack said. “He’s a terrific player and we’re gonna have to do a really, really great job because they have two all-leaguers, two guys going for player of the year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the offensive end, the Gauchos will be trying to shake off their recent malaise. UCSB has scored under 70 points in each of its last three games, including a 63-point performance in a loss to Hawai’i on Saturday that saw the team shoot just 36% in the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos struggled to get the ball moving in Saturday’s game and finished with only3 assists as a team. Ball movement, accordingly, has been a point of emphasis in practice leading into Wednesday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to share the ball,” Pasternack said. “We have to do a better job of not taking the easy shot, but really working the ball around.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Max Heidegger has slowly been working himself back into form after a 10-game absence, and if his 21 points on Saturday are any indication, that process is going well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Heidegger back and bombing away from the outside, the Gauchos are hoping things will open up down low for their big men. The team will also be relying on those big men to pick up their production on the glass.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got away from our team identity, rebounding, against Hawai’i,” Pasternack said. “We were -10, which is the worst we’ve been this year. We’re 11-1 when we outrebound our opponents so that’s what we’ve got to focus on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to get back to their identity on the glass, the Gauchos will have to contend with Diane, CSUN’s leading rebounder. If UCSB can get the forward in foul trouble and off the court, those odds will improve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB hosts CSUN on Wednesday night in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

dropped the Gauchos to 12-6 on the season and 1-2 in Big West play, while the Rainbow Warriors improved to 12-6 and 3-0. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB and Hawai’i went blow-for-blow in the first half, neither team able to crack open a sturdy lead. The Gauchos jumped ahead to start, the Rainbow Warriors swung back and took a 26-18 lead and UCSB closed the half on a 17-7 run to go up 35-33. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos shot 44.7 % from the field and made just one 2 3-pointers, doing most of their damage from inside the arc instead. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin led the way with 10 points, while senior guard Max Heidegger and junior forward Robinson Idehen both chipped in 6 points off the bench.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For whatever reason, the rim was much less hospitable to the Gauchos in the second half. A Max Heidegger layup, almost four minutes into the half, provided UCSB’s first points of the period and stanched an 8-0 Hawaii run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The damage, however, was done. The Gauchos never led again, or even managed to trim the lead down to two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s shooting numbers fell off a cliff to 36% in the second half, while Hawai’i’s stayed stable at 50%. Heidegger was the lone bright spot for the Gauchos with 15 points in the second half, giving him a game-high 21 overall, but his teammates were only able to muster up 13 points combined in the last 20 minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Futile as it was, Heidegger’s offensive performance was a promising sign for UCSB. Saturday’s game was the senior’s second since returning from a 10-game absence and was an impressive return to form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rainbow Warriors, on the other hand, pulled ahead with a balanced attack that saw four players score at least 6 points, but no player scored more than 8 points in the second half. Hawai’i’s balance held true all game: junior guard Drew Buggs led the team with 12 points, but three other players scored at least 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buggs also played the role of facilitator on Saturday and played it masterfully. The junior dished out 12 assists against just 2 turnovers, a sterling ratio for any point guard. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos, meanwhile, struggled to distribute the ball. The UCSB team combined for 3 assists, their lowest total of the season and just the third time they’ve finished with less than 10 assists in a game this season. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawai’i also outrebounded the Gauchos, 33 to 23, on Saturday. Nine of those Rainbow Warrior rebounds were on the offensive glass, compared to just 2 for the Gauchos, giving the hosts a 10-4 advantage in second-chance points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore big man Amadou Sow is typically UCSB’s go-to man on the glass, but he was limited to just over 18 minutes by foul trouble. Sow picked up 2 fouls in both halves, which forced Gaucho head coach Joe Pasternack to rely more heavily on the back up Idehen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s loss was two in a row for the Gauchos, who have struggled offensively in Big West play. The struggle hasn’t been consistent from game to game, as UCSB shot reasonably well but turned the ball over 17 times in the team’s loss to Long Beach State last week, complicating efforts to find a panacea for the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A panacea might be hard to find, but the Gauchos will need to find some sort of patch as Big West play continues if they want to contend. UCSB hosts CSUN on Wednesday night and then UC Riverside on Saturday, two teams above the Gauchos in the conference standings. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

That head of steam turned into a wire-to-wire 63-45 dismantling of Cal Poly on Wednesday night in a statement game for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s win pushed the team’s record to 12-4 overall and 1-0 in the Big West, while Cal Poly fell to 3-12 overall and 0-1 in the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB defense wholly stifled the Mustangs in their strongest performance all season. Cal Poly shot just 28.3% from the field and were only able to muster 17 points in the second half, allowing the Gauchos to walk away with the victory.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior guard Devearl Ramsey had four steals — the most on the team — and set the defensive tone. UCSB created 14 points off of turnovers, which helped the Gauchos pull away early and keep the Mustangs at bay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cal Poly couldn’t buy a bucket against the UCSB defense, but the going was much easier on the other end. The Gauchos shot 51.1% from the field, hit 7 of their 14 threes and had few issues pulling away. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin led the Gauchos with 15 points and 3 three-pointers, to go along with 4 rebounds and 4 assists. Ramsey, somewhat surprisingly, led UCSB in rebounding with 8 boards, the first time the point guard has led the team in rebounding this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos now turn their attention to the Long Beach State team, which will travel north on Saturday to the Thunderdome. The Beach, at 5-12, have had a rough go of it this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of Long Beach’s struggles are a result of a brutal nonconference schedule. The Beach have played the 16th hardest schedule in the country, according to kenpom.com, with losses to several high-profile teams including No. 24 Arizona and St. Mary’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then again, the Beach have also often beaten themselves. LBSU turns the ball over 17.4 times per game, creating 18.5 points off of turnovers per game for the team’s opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach’s ball-security issues can be attributed in some measure to the tough schedule and to their scorching pace (34th in the nation according to Fox Sports), but the fact remains that the Beach make a lot of mistakes and create a lot of opportunities for their opponents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos haven’t been the most effective team when it comes to creating opponent turnovers and turning them into points, however. UCSB forced over 15 turnovers in just 2 of their 7 games in December and won’t have the same physical and skill advantages that LBSU’s more high-profile opponents had. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s matchup will be a clash of playstyles, with UCSB coming in at 330th in the nation in pace according to Fox Sports. Long Beach State will be eager to play fast, and whichever team succeeds in setting the pace will have a leg up on both ends of the court.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite playing at a much slower pace than the Beach, the Gauchos will have their Saturday opponent beat in points per game, 73.7 to 68.6. The Long Beach State team pushes the pace and takes a lot of shots, but they don’t make many of them with a 43.2% rate from the field and those turnovers create a lot of empty possessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Beach does successfully turn one of the team’s many possessions into points, it’s often either sophomore guard Chance Hunter, sophomore guard Michael Carter III or junior guard Colin Slater doing the scoring. Hunter leads the team with 13.9 points per game, and Carter III and Slater are both in double-digits as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunter is also second on the team in rebounding with 5.1 rebounds per game, only behind 6’11” freshman center Joshua Morgan, an impressive feat for a 6’6” player like Hunter. Carter, meanwhile, leads the Beach with 3.1 assists per game but turns the ball over 3.8 times per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Beach State lacks significant size inside, which should present UCSB’s sophomore forward Amadou Sow with offensive opportunities. Morgan is the only Beach player taller than 6’9” Sow, and at 195 pounds is at a disadvantage against the 235-pound Sow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exploiting advantages, whether it’s size or turnovers, will be the name of the game for the Gauchos on Saturday. If UCSB is able to turn Long Beach State’s mistakes and size into stops and points, then they’ll have a good shot at keeping the good times going.</span></p><div

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All season long, UCSB men’s basketball Head Coach Joe Pasternack has been focused on his team’s defense. That was especially true after an 88-69 victory over Menlo College on Nov. 23 that saw the Oaks shoot over 50% from the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the three games since that lackluster performance, however, the UCSB defense has come on strong. So strong, in fact, that the Gauchos have now won four games in a row thanks in large part to defensive performance, with the latest win a 64-60 road victory over Cal State Bakersfield on Tuesday night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Roadrunners shot just 42.3% against the Gaucho defense and turned the ball over 11 times. Bakersfield became the third UCSB opponent in a row to shoot under 50% and shot just 25% from beyond the 3-point line, the worst mark of any Gaucho opponent this year.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only one Roadrunner scored in double digits and the Gauchos held redshirt junior forward Taze Moore, Bakersfield’s leading scorer this season, to a season-worst 3 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The defensive success enabled UCSB to overcome a 38.5% shooting night and 11 turnovers of its own. The Gauchos were especially cold in the second half, when the team went 8-25 from the field, but still managed to win the half 31-29.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB took a 33-31 lead into halftime and never trailed in the second half, but also never led comfortably. The Gauchos’ biggest lead was a 56-50 advantage with a little over four minutes left; the Roadrunners trimmed this lead down to 56-54 less than a minute later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two free throws from sophomore forward Amadou Sow pushed the lead to 59-54 at the 2:38 mark and seemed to put the Gauchos in a position to put the game away. UCSB got stuck at 0:59, however, and the Roadrunners clawed their way to within one with 30 seconds to go on a layup from junior guard Czar Perry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perry was almost the Roadrunners’ entire offense in crunch time, with eight of the team’s final 10 points. The junior had a game-high 23 points on 8-10 shooting, making him the only player the Gauchos just couldn’t stop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin responded to Perry’s layup by going 1-2 from the free throw line, which gave Bakersfield the chance to tie the game with another two-pointer. The Gauchos finally managed to stop Perry, however, forcing the junior into an offensive foul with two seconds left that effectively sealed the game for UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redshirt transfer forward Matt Freeman had one of his best games offensively as a Gaucho with a season-high 19 points and four three-pointers. Freeman is now shooting 50% on three-pointers this season, the best mark on the team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman also knocked down all four of his free throw attempts in the last 10 seconds of Tuesday’s game, which was instrumental in closing the Roadrunners out. Freeman went 7-8 from the line overall in the game, and his 87.5 percentage is also best on the team this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos head back out on the road for their next game, although a little further afield. UCSB will travel to Texas to take on UT Arlington on Saturday for a 12 p.m. PST matchup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arlington has had a remarkably uneven season so far in 2019, at 4-5. The Mavericks won their first two games, lost their next three and have alternated wins and losses losses in the four games since.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of Arlington’s losses have come against ranked teams. The Mavericks got run out of the gym by then-No. 14 Oregon 77-47 in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, but followed that rout up with a heartbreaking 72-66 loss to then-No. 8 Gonzaga.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s unclear which Mavericks team will show up on Saturday, but Arlington will for sure try to win with their defense. The Mavericks have held six of their nine opponents under 70 points and opposing teams are shooting just 39.8% from the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arlington is nabbing 5.1 steals per game this year, with redshirt sophomore guard David Azore and senior guard Brian Warren leading the way with around one steal per game apiece. Azore and Warren have also been leading the Mavericks offense: Azore is averaging a team-best 12.6 points per game to go with 4.3 rebounds per game while Warren is scoring 11.6 points per game and handing out a team-high 4 assists per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six-foot-nine senior forward Jabari Narcis has pulled down 7 rebounds a game so far this season, and his 16 points were an integral part of Arlington’s effort against Gonzaga. Sow stands the same height and gives up just five pounds to Narcis, which should make for an interesting matchup on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arlington is not a special team offensively, which should give the Gaucho defense a chance to come up big again. With four wins and three strong defensive performances in a row, UCSB has the confidence and momentum to take the victory.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

teams, the UCSB men’s basketball team will get a bit of a break when it takes on Menlo College on Saturday afternoon in the Thunderdome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Golden State Athletic Conference lacks the cachet of the Pac-12 or Conference USA, the Oaks come into Saturday’s game as hot as any team the Gauchos have played this year. Menlo is 4-1 this season after losing 73-70 to Cal Maritime on Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the Gauchos are 1-3 after falling 78-67 to Oregon State on Wednesday night.

UCSB shot just under 37% from the field and went 5-27 on 3-pointers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore forward Amadou Sow led the Gauchos in points and rebounds with 14 and 11, respectively, while graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman was 6-9 from the field for 13 points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos had no answer, however, for Beaver forward Tres Tinkle, who scored 27 points, pulled down 11 rebounds and went to the free throw line a game-high 9 times. Oregon State, as a whole, found offense much easier to come by than UCSB did and shot 56.6% from the field despite going 4-15 from beyond the 3-point line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB gets a few days to move on from Oregon State and turn its attention towards Menlo. The Oaks represent something of a reprieve for the Gauchos, at least on paper, and UCSB will likely be the toughest team Menlo plays all season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Oaks are not a particularly tall team, something the Gauchos will look to exploit on Saturday. Menlo’s tallest player who plays significant minutes is 6’7” freshman forward Jake Tranter and 6’6” sophomore forward Corey Le’aupepe leads the team with 6.6 rebounds per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB boasts three significant contributors taller than Tranter: 6’9”sophomore forward Sow, 6’10” junior forward Robinson Idehen and 6’10” graduate transfer forward Freeman. While Freeman is more of an outside threat, Sow and Idehen will both have the opportunity to use their size to their advantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menlo relies heavily on 3-pointers, with distance shots making up about 40% of their overall field goal attempts. The Oaks are shooting 41.8% on those 3-point attempts and will likely rely on their shooting to attempt the upset.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Menlo might be onto something with that strategy against UCSB. The Gauchos are shooting 31.8% from beyond the arc, but their opponents are bombing away at a 40.3% clip.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through four games, the Gauchos have proven vulnerable to the 3-point shot. That’s music to the Oaks’ ears and something Head Coach Joe Pasternack will likely focus on going into Saturday’s game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four different Menlo players — sophomore guard Ross Williams, senior guard Jeremiah Testa, junior guard N’Jai LeBlanc and junior guard Curtis Witt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have taken at least ten 3-point attempts this season, and all have proven to be more than capable shooters. Rice University had a similar array of shooters and used them to break the UCSB defense down last weekend, a result Pasternack would like to avoid this time around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant chunk of Menlo’s successful start to the season came without one of its best and most experienced players, senior forward John Paine. Paine missed the second and third games of the season and is still working his way back into the lineup, but he is already reasserting himself as a major offensive weapon for the Oaks with 13.3 points per game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limiting Menlo’s 3-point shooting will throw a wrench in the gears of the Oaks’ offense and allow the Gauchos to focus much of their remaining attention on Paine. If UCSB fails to do so, they could be in for another rough afternoon in the Thunderdome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB takes on Menlo on Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

in the second half, the UCSB men’s basketball team seemed to feel that they could coast to a Saturday afternoon victory over Rice University — but the Owls quickly proved them wrong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos collapsed in the final 12 minutes, scoring just 17 points to the Owls’ 40. Sophomore guard Payton Moore capped off the comeback with a last-second layup to give the Owls their first lead since 11:10 in the first half and a stunning 82-81 victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All we talked about all week was 10 four-minute wars,” UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said after the game. “That was all we talked about at halftime.

UCSB shot almost 62% from the field and raced into the locker room at halftime with a 47-27 lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost all of the Gauchos’ first-half production came from inside the paint. Senior guard Max Heidegger repeatedly beat his man off the dribble and finished through contact on the rim, while sophomore forward Amadou Sow and junior forward Robinson Idehen overpowered their defenders down low.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger finished with a team-high 21 points, while Sow was close behind with 19 points and 7 rebounds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side of the court, the UCSB defense made open shots scarce for Rice. Sophomore guard Trey Murphy III knocked down a few 3-pointers early on, and the Owls jumped out to a lead in the first few minutes; however, the visitors shot just 32.1% from the field in the first half and rapidly fell behind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that Gaucho defense was wholly absent in the second half. Both teams scored at a steady clip to open up the final 20 minutes, and the Gauchos even managed to extend their lead to 22 points a couple of times, but only Rice managed to keep their initial pace up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Owls missed only 6 shots in the second half, but they were particularly unstoppable in the last 10 minutes. The visitors ripped off a 28-9 run to tie the game at 78-apiece, and it was clear that UCSB had no response defensively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Defensively, we got really exposed,” Pasternack said. “Same thing with UCLA, we can’t play two halves of defense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rice scored more or less anyway they wanted in the second half. Murphy hit a couple more 3-pointers, and it seemed as though there was an open Owl either cutting or dribbling to the hoop on each and every possession.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos, on the other hand, were reminiscent of a battered boxer praying to be saved by the bell — or in this case, the final buzzer. Sow and graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman provided almost all of the team’s offense in the final 10 minutes, but it wasn’t enough to keep the Owls from landing the knockout blow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman scored 11 points in the second half and finished with 15 points, 5 rebounds and 7 assists. It was the graduate transfer’s best game as a Gaucho so far, and his 2 steals in the first half set up some of the early offense.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rice’s senior forward Robert Martin got open inside and converted a layup with 3:16 to go that cut the lead to 76-74, but Sow responded with a strong finish through contact on the other end. The sophomore Gaucho drew a foul on the contact but missed the free throw, keeping the score at 78-74.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Moore layup and 2 free throws from sophomore guard Chris Mullins tied the game up at 78 and sent the large contingent of traveling Rice fans into a frenzy. Freeman coolly responded with a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 1:10 remaining, but that was the only counterpunch the Gauchos had in them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a Rice timeout, Mullins came back on the other end and converted another layup with 41 seconds to go. UCSB milked the clock a bit on the next possession, but Heidegger’s missed fadeaway off the side of the backboard returned the ball to the Owls with nine seconds to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Owls raced down the court, and Moore got inside once again for a layup with just four seconds on the clock. Pasternack had used his last timeout with around six minutes left in the half, forcing junior guard Devearl Ramsey to collect the inbounds pass and race down the court before hoisting a half-court attempt that fell to the right of the hoop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was trying to regroup our guys defensively [by calling the last timeout],” Pasternack said. “I could see it slipping away. Probably needed it at the end, but I wanted to slow their run down and not wait. Obviously, the timeouts didn’t work.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moore was integral to the Owls’ comeback with 17 points in the second half after scoring just 1 point in the first 20 minutes of the game. Saturday’s performance was the sophomore’s best of the season and seemed to take the Gauchos by surprise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was no game plan to stop Payton Moore,” Pasternack said. “We do what we do, and in the second half, he just punked us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos will now have to regroup and get ready to take on Oregon State on the road on Wednesday night. The Beavers are at 3-1 this season with wins over Cal State Northridge, Iowa State and Wyoming and a loss at the hands of Oklahoma.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior forward Tres Tinkle leads Oregon State so far this season in the three main offensive statistics with 21.5 points, 10 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. Tinkle is shooting 45% from 3 and at 6’7’’ will present a difficult task for the Gauchos with his combination of range and rebounding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a team, the Beavers are shooting just over 42% from 3-point land this season. That makes them the best shooting team UCSB has played so far this season, which could be an issue for the Gauchos given that Rice just shot 13-25 from the 3-point line on Saturday.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

So far this season, that’s only been occasionally true.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB is 1-1at this point in the season, with 22 free throw attempts in a win over Jackson State and 9 free throw attempts in a loss to UCLA. When the Gauchos host Rice University on Saturday afternoon, they’ll be aiming for a number closer to 22.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Gauchos need any more evidence that free throws are important, they need not look any further than the last time they played Rice. UCSB topped the Owls 99-89 in an overtime thriller last season thanks in large part to 23 free throws made on 24 attempts, a far cry from this season’s UCLA game. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Owls are 3-1 this season with wins over Penn, Wayland Baptist and Northwestern State and a 91-43 loss at the hands of Arkansas. Penn beat Alabama in Tuscaloosa earlier this season, adding a little extra luster to Rice’s victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rice returns with three starters from last year’s team, but sophomore guard Trey Murphy III, new to the starting lineup this year, has been the team’s most impactful player so far this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Murphy leads the Owls with 14.5 points per game on 45% field goal shooting and 33% shooting from beyond the arc. The sophomore has increased his point total in every game so far this season, including most recently with a 25-point performance against Northwestern State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Trey Murphy is a great player,” UCSB head Head Coach Pasternack said. “He can really shoot the ball. He’s a three-man playing the four-man, he can drive, he can shoot the ball, they iso him a lot and our four men are gonna have to do a great job defending him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior guard Ako Adams is second on the team in scoring with 11 points per game so far this season. Setting aside a game against Wayland Baptist that saw Adams play just 10 minutes and score zero points, the senior is averaging 14.7 points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adams, who has started every game for the Owls since his sophomore year, is one of four seniors on the team. Fellow senior Robert Martin, a forward, is the only other senior in the starting lineup and provides some experience in the frontcourt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin is averaging 5.3 rebounds a game so far this season, second only to 6-8 sophomore wing Drew Peterson and his 7.3 rebounds a game. Keeping both Martin and Peterson off the glass is a must for the Gauchos, who lost the rebounding battle, and subsequently, the war on Sunday against UCLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rice has turned the ball over 16.8 times per game so far this season, third-worst in the Conference USA. That number is inflated by a nightmare performance against Arkansas that saw the Owls turn the ball over 27 times, but the point remains that Rice has struggled with ball security.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos, meanwhile, have struggled to force turnovers in their two games this season, setting up an interesting clash on Saturday. Against UCSB, Jackson State and UCLA both turned the ball over 9 times, which would make for Rice’s most ball-secure game this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we have to do is play 40 minutes of defense,” Pasternack said. “Against Jackson State we only played a half, … and against UCLA we only played in the first half defensively.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Owls haven’t excelled at taking care of the basketball, they’ve done at least a so-so job of keeping opponents away from the free throw line. While Northwestern State did achieve  24 chances from the charity stripe during their matchup, no other team has cracked 15 free throw attempts this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to follow in Northwestern State’s footsteps, the Gauchos will have to play aggressively on offense and focus on getting to the rim rather than settling for jumpshots. Rice presents much less of a size disadvantage for UCSB than UCLA does, which should make interior offense a little easier to come by.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to be more aggressive offensively, attacking the basket, driving the ball, posting up and using our size to our advantage to get to the free throw line,” Pasternack said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB played Rice aggressively last season and got 24 free throws and a win out of it. The situation isn’t exactly the same this season, but if the Gauchos follow a similar blueprint, they’ll put themselves in a position to win again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

UCSB made several comeback attempts, but ultimately fell short and lost 77-61.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loss dropped the Gauchos to 1-1 on the season, and pushed UCLA to 2-0 under new head coach Mick Cronin.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both teams got off to a slow start on Sunday, combining for 8 total points in the first six minutes, but 9 points and 4 assists from senior guard Max Heidegger helped the Gauchos get their offense going. Sophomore forward Jay Nagle and graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman both chipped in 6 points on 2 threes as well, and helped push UCSB out to a lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were never able to widen their lead much, however. Nagle’s second three gave UCSB a 29-23 advantage with just under four minutes to go in the first, but UCLA hung tight and went into halftime down just 34-32.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s inability to build a significant cushion in the first half doomed them in the second half. Just as Long Beach State learned a few nights earlier, it takes a lot of cushion to topple a team like UCLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2-point cushion, such that it was, lasted the Gauchos just under a minute of second half action. Two UCSB turnovers and two Prince Ali buckets reversed the situation and put UCLA up 36-34 with 19:14 left in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos never regained the lead. The Bruins built up an 11-point lead over the following five minutes, largely off the strength of their size and rebounding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB was staring down something of a size disparity from the get-go, but the team managed to keep pace with the Bruins’ big men on the glass in the first half. That changed completely in the second half.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the final 20 minutes of action, UCLA grabbed 21 rebounds to UCSB’s 10. Included in UCLA’s 21 boards were ten offensive rebounds, many of which quickly became second-chance points. The Bruins dominated that category all game with 20 against just 5 for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of those second-chance buckets came in the second half, and enabled the Bruins to take control of the game and coast to victory. Redshirt sophomore center Jalen Hill did the most damage with 22 points and 10 rebounds, 8 of which came on the offensive glass.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s big men couldn’t contain Hill and his teammates, and couldn’t stay out of foul trouble, either. Sophomore forward Amadou Sow and junior forward Robinson Idehen both fouled out in the second half, and Freeman finished with 4 fouls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fouls aside, Freeman turned in a solid performance in his second game in a UCSB jersey. A transfer from Oklahoma, Freeman knocked down 3 three’s and finished with 12 points, second only to Heidegger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heidegger provided almost half of the Gauchos’ second half offense with 12 points, and finished with 21 on the evening. The senior dished out a team-high 6 assists against only 2 turnovers as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCLA might have taken swift control of the game in the second half, but the Gauchos didn’t go down without a fight. They put up several fights, in fact, the last of which saw the lead cut to eight on a Heidegger layup with 4:44 to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as they had done to each comeback attempt before it, however, the Bruins stifled this last gasp with rebounding and post offense. Hill corralled an offensive rebound and put it back up to make the game 67-57, and followed that up with a dunk on the next possession. The lead never again dipped below double-digits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill did the most damage of any Bruin, but he had plenty of help. Sophomore guard Jules Bernard was a dynamo off the bench with 20 points and 8 rebounds, while guards Ali and Chris Smith had 12 and 13 points, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s job doesn’t get too much easier next week. The Gauchos host Rice on Saturday before traveling to Corvallis to take on Oregon State, another Pac-12 opponent, next Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Size will likely be an issue again against the Beavers, but UCSB proved on Sunday they can hang with marquee competition. The trick next time is hanging with them for two whole halves of basketball.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91137\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-12/ucsb-mens-basketball-drops-first-road-game-against-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91137\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-12/ucsb-mens-basketball-drops-first-road-game-against-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-12/ucsb-mens-basketball-drops-first-road-game-against-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-12/ucsb-mens-basketball-drops-first-road-game-against-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-12/ucsb-mens-basketball-drops-first-road-game-against-ucla/","id":1188,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[1187,1186,1185],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":6,"route":"/authors/17"}},"__N_SSG":true}
