Racioppi didn’t let another ball past her for the remainder of the tournament, which saw the Gauchos top Ohio, Vermont, Cal Poly, Penn State and Texas in succession.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, UCSB’s easiest wins were its last two. The Gauchos blew out the Nittany Lions 4-0 in the semifinal and hung a 3-0 shutout on the Longhorns in the tournament final.</p>\n<p>A dominant defense was the common thread between this year’s championship team and last year’s side.</p>\n<p>UCSB surrendered only one goal in the 2016 tournament, which saw the Gauchos defeat UNC in a 1-0 thriller for the title.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s club soccer success goes beyond just the last two seasons. No other team has more than three national titles in the last 11 years. The Gauchos have seven.</p>\n<p>“One of the traditions we like to talk about is our success on the field and what we bring to each game,” Head Coach Todd Heil said. “Back-to-back is great and seven is pretty impressive, but year in and year out we’ve just been very fortunate to have a great group of girls.”</p>\n<p>Such dominance is only possible through passion and commitment on the part of everyone involved in the club soccer program. That starts with the players, naturally.</p>\n<p>“With the club sports mentality, it’s a group of girls that just truly want to be there and want to play the game,” Heil said. “They’re there on their own behest; they’re not there on scholarship. They are what some might call the true student-athletes, and when it clicks and they just want to all be there together, that’s even more special.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the players contribute more to the program than just their on-field performance. They’re the front-line recruiters for the team as well, manning booths and getting the word out in order to bolster the roster each year.</p>\n<p>“A lot of [the recruitment] is on the returning player,” Heil said. “Basically, you’re [creating] the path. If it’s not social media, then you’re working a table at Spring Insight. You’re just trying to get the word out once students actually become students of UCSB.”<br>\nOnce the recruitment work has been done and the season has actually started, things don’t get any easier for the club players.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s soccer club team practices three times a week rather than six times like the Division I team, but it has to balance those practices against a full schedule of academics and extracurricular activities.</p>\n<p>“Our weeks are so busy that the weekends would be a great time to get school work done, but during fall these weekends are filled with games,” Club President Ann Marie Mansholt, a four-year player, said. “This just means that time management is crucial, and we somehow get it done, whether it’s studying on a plane or in the lobbies of our hotels.”<br>\nThe club season starts right alongside school in late September and wastes no time in getting going.</p>\n<p>“We get going the first week of school,” Heil said. “We have regionals the fourth week of school and nationals is basically right around that seventh week of school. That’s cramming in a lot. You’re playing about 15 soccer games pretty quickly.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79948\" style=\"width: 372px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2028394936\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79945\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79948\" data-attachment-id=\"79948\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/ucsb-womens-club-soccer-shines-in-back-to-back-fashion-win-7th-national-title-with-3-0-win-over-texas/wcsoccer_pic2-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WCSoccer_Pic2 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79948\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1-768x1024.jpg?resize=362%2C482\" alt=\"\" width=\"362\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WCSoccer_Pic2-1.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of Jordan Burke</em></p></div>\n<p>It’s a lot to ask not only from the players but from the coaches as well. Heil is the boys’ soccer coach at Santa Barbara High School as well as a club soccer coach, but he manages to balance his responsibilities and keep the team running smoothly.</p>\n<p>“The continuous success starts with our coach, Todd Heil,” Mansholt said. “He has been the coach since the start of this club about 18 years ago. He has built this program from the bottom up and has given this program consistent leadership.”</p>\n<p>While the club team may not get as much academic and structural support from the university as the Division I team does, that doesn’t mean it is on its own. Both Heil and Mansholt made sure to credit the Recreational Sports program for its support of their team and all other club squads.</p>\n<p>As a senior, Mansholt is going out on top. It’s an emotional experience, but she’ll be leaving behind a program with a deep tradition of success and a bright future.</p>\n<p>“I believe this team can continue success into the future by keeping the close bonds we have formed and keeping true to our style of soccer,” she said. “Now that this younger group has a taste of winning back-to-back national championships, I believe they will keep working harder than ever to win another one and keep having a blast while doing so.”</p>\n<p>That ethos of success and hard work balanced with fun is what makes the UCSB women’s club soccer team, and all club sports, special.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB women’s volleyball team didn’t waste much time this past weekend. One night after taking Cal State Fullerton in straight sets, the Gauchos found themselves on the other side of a sweep against UC Riverside, splitting their two weekend matches against the bottom two teams in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Friday’s result, the 3-0 (25-16, 25-22, 25-17) decision over Fullerton, wasn’t much of a surprise. After all, the Gauchos swept the Titans earlier this season at the Thunderdome in even more lopsided fashion.</p>\n<p>The Riverside sweep, on the other hand, was a much more startling result. UCSB, just like with Fullerton, had little trouble sweeping the Highlanders the first time around, but the rematch was a different story entirely.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Riverside controlled the majority of all three matches on its way to a 3-0 (25-20, 25-18, 25-20) victory over UCSB, its first win over a non-Fullerton Big West opponent in 13 tries.</p>\n<p>The split weekend slid the Gauchos to 8-19 on the season, and 7-8 in conference play. That’s good enough for fifth place in the Big West, a half game back of UC Davis with one match against UC Irvine left to try and close that small gap.</p>\n<p>Prior to this past weekend, UCSB had hoped to maybe catch the Anteaters for third place, but Saturday’s loss to Riverside rendered that dream unattainable.</p>\n<p>On Friday, however, the dream was still alive. The Titans scored the first point of the match on a Katelyn Nielson kill, but that would prove to be Fullerton’s only lead of the match. UCSB dominated from that point forward, cruising to a 25-16 win in the first set.</p>\n<p>The final tally of the second set, 25-22, was slightly closer than that of its predecessor, but the Titans never really threatened the Gauchos at any point. UCSB led 20-14 at one point, and simply held off the hosts down the stretch to walk to the set win.</p>\n<p>Eager to wrap things up, the Gauchos put forth a more dominant performance in the third and final set. Thanks to a handful of Lindsey Ruddins kills, as well as a couple each from Chloe Allen and Kija Rivers, UCSB controlled the set from the first point, and clinched the match with little worry.</p>\n<p>As is tradition, Ruddins led both teams in kills with 26 Friday night, including the match-sealing kill to end the third set. 15 digs gave the junior outside hitter her tenth double-double of the season, by far the best on the team.</p>\n<p>Ruddins didn’t wait long to improve that mark, either. The junior notched her eleventh double-double one night later against the Highlanders with 20 kills and 14 digs in another strong performance.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside, however, proved to be more Ruddins-resistant than Fullerton. The Highlanders held the rest of the UCSB attack quiet, aside from Chloe Allen’s nine kills on .391 hitting, and secured the victory with some efficient attacking.</p>\n<p>Despite entering the game with a hitting percentage of just .181, Riverside flexed a mostly-error free attack on Saturday night. Led by Mickayla Sherman’s 19 kills on .312 hitting and Brooke Callahan’s 13 kills on sparkling .579 hitting, the Highlanders hit .344 as a team, their best hitting percentage in Big West play this season.</p>\n<p>Two Riverside runs, a six-point spree in the first set and a nine-pointer in the second, determined Saturday’s match. Both runs moved their respective sets from tightly contested to Highlander-dominated, something Riverside made sure not to squander.</p>\n<p>Those two runs proved to be too much for the Gauchos to overcome, especially after the Highlanders slowly pulled away in the third set for the clinching victory. Riverside simply just didn’t mess up very often, giving UCSB few chances to capitalize on mistakes and turn the match around.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos close their season out on Tuesday night in Irvine against the Anteaters at 7:00 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79853\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-19/ucsb-faces-3-match-road-trip-to-close-out-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79853\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-19/ucsb-faces-3-match-road-trip-to-close-out-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-19/ucsb-faces-3-match-road-trip-to-close-out-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-19/ucsb-faces-3-match-road-trip-to-close-out-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-19/ucsb-faces-3-match-road-trip-to-close-out-the-season/","id":4953,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4952,4951,4950],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes Goal-Oriented Approach Into Road Trip","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NEW-WomenVolleyballUCI-11.10.17-SichengWang-1-print.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The final two weeks of the season are here and the UCSB women's volleyball team is hoping to make a quick run to improve its position within the Big West standings.

We are also striving to lead the conference in three statistical categories.”</p>\n<p>Within conference play, the Gauchos are first in digs per set (15.59) and second in both blocks (2.24) and aces (1.73) per set, giving them a serious chance to fulfill Coach Lantagne Welch’s wishes to finish atop the conference in all three categories.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Doing so will require strong performances from every player that dons a UCSB uniform this weekend but especially the team’s middle blockers.</p>\n<p>“We are looking for Nicole [Omwanghe], Charlie [Robinson] and Chloe [Allen] to make a strong impact in the front row,” Lantagne Welch said. “We want to serve tough all weekend [as well].”</p>\n<p>UCSB will strive to achieve each of its goals when it faces Cal State Fullerton on Friday and UC Riverside on Saturday as part of its season-ending three-game road trip. Santa Barbara leaves with a 7-18 overall and 6-7 Big West mark, good for fifth in the conference.</p>\n<p>Road trips have been something of a struggle for the Gauchos this year, who are 1-7 this season when playing outside of the Thunderdome or Rob Gym.<br>\nUCSB’s most recent road match at Cal Poly was another loss, but Lantagne Welch saw plenty of improvement nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Our last road match could quite possibly be our best match of the year,” she said. “I think we solved [our road struggles] on the last road trip and take that same preparation into these games.”</p>\n<p>Seemingly always prepared is the Gauchos’ star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins.</p>\n<p>The sophomore has had an amazing season, and she currently leads the nation and Big West in kills per set (5.78), while also leading the conference in points per set (6.33).<br>\nHer 462 kills are the most in the conference and rank 13th in the nation.</p>\n<p>After a week of play in which she recorded a .331 hitting clip along with averaging 2.22 digs and 0.67 blocks per set, Ruddins was awarded her third Big West Women’s Volleyball Player of the Week honor this season.</p>\n<p>In addition to the offense Ruddins brings, the fact that UCSB will be facing the worst two teams in the Big West this weekend certainly won’t hurt either.</p>\n<p>Both Fullerton and Riverside have just one win in conference play this year, and both wins came at the other’s expense.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the Gauchos can’t afford to get overconfident. It’s been a few weeks since UCSB has seen either team, so there’s still plenty of time to improve and prepare for the rematch.</p>\n<p>“Our team will have the confidence, but at the same time we need to respect our opponents and realize that they have improved and to expect it to be much tougher this time around,” Lantagne Welch said.</p>\n<p>Much like UCSB, the Fullerton offense is mostly built around one attacker.</p>\n<p>In the Titans’ case, that’s junior outside hitter Madeline Schneider. Schneider has 317 kills on a 3.30 kill per set pace; the Gauchos managed to hold her to just five kills back on Sept. 23.</p>\n<p>A repeat of that defensive performance will go a long way toward securing a UCSB win on Friday night. Avoiding middle blockers Aniya Henry (71 blocks) and Summer Kerins (68 blocks) would be similarly helpful.</p>\n<p>Against UC Riverside, the Gauchos’ attention will be more dispersed in response to the Highlanders’ more balanced attack. Junior outside hitter Ahuna Kaiulani leads Riverside in kills with 226, but she’s not far ahead of the other five Highlanders boasting triple-digit kills.</p>\n<p>Junior setter Chelsea Doyle has handled the majority of the facilitating work for Riverside with her 860 assists, but her 251 kills and 18 service aces, both second on the team, have been important for the Highlanders as well.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are still in striking distance from the third-place spot on the end-of-the-year Big West podium, but securing their spot will likely require an impeccable close to the season. That process starts on Friday in Fullerton.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays CSUF on Friday, Nov. 17, at 7 p.m. and UC Riverside the following night, Nov. 18, at 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

For a team with nine underclassmen, that’s a big deal.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have a chance to showcase its continued development and maybe pick up a couple wins this weekend. Santa Barbara will play host to UC Irvine on Friday and then UC Davis on Saturday for Senior Night during its final home matches of the season.</p>\n<p>The two consecutive losses have knocked the Gauchos (6-17, 5-6) down to fifth in the Big West standings, directly behind the two teams they’ll play this weekend. Just two wins in the Thunderdome, and UCSB will likely find itself back in the top half of the conference.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine (21-4, 9-3) sits in third place in the Big West, three and a half games ahead of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Five Anteaters have triple-digit kills so far this season, but no attacker has more than 300. It’s a balanced attack, coordinated primarily by junior setter Ali Koumelis and her 883 assists.</p>\n<p>“I expect to see a diverse and balanced offense,” Lantagne Welch said. “They have been getting solid production across the board with their experienced outside, their lefty right-side, and they have a really quick attacking middle.”</p>\n<p>UC Irvine has won its last two games, both 3-0 decisions, against Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside. Three games back from Cal Poly, the Anteaters have an outside chance of grabbing a conference championship but must first find a way to overcome the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Following Friday, UC Davis comes to town for UCSB’s Senior Night. The Aggies are 15-11 overall and 7-6 in the Big West, directly above the Gauchos.<br>\nUCSB took down the Aggies while on the road back on Oct. 17, but that was a different UC Davis team. UCD has won its last four matches and will look to give Cal Poly its first conference loss the night before it visits Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We can take the things we did well [in the first match against UCD], the confidence that we prevailed and, of course, the things that were a little off to improve this time around,” Lantagne Welch said. “Davis is a better team this time around, but definitely we are better now, too.”</p>\n<p>Saturday night’s match will be preceded by a Senior Night ceremony for UCSB’s two seniors, defensive specialist Sydney Bast and outside hitter Chanel Hoffman. Bast and Hoffman have served as the Gauchos’ veterans throughout this up-and-down season and earned high praise from their head coach.</p>\n<p>“Chanel and Syd are first, and most importantly, great people,” Lantagne Welch said. “They are people you just want to be around. They are my first two recruits ever here at UCSB and have embraced their roles as leaders on this team. They speak up and share experiences and bring extra to the team every day. They truly put the team before themselves, and it has helped the team all year long.”</p>\n<p>Playing in their last-ever home matches as Gauchos, Bast and Hoffman will be motivated to finish strong. Their teammates will be similarly motivated to send their seniors out on top, which could prove to be key on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“The team will want to give everything they have for Chanel and Syd,” Lantagne Welch said. “They are a huge part of this program and you just want to put everything out on the floor for them.”<br>\nThe underclassmen have been the focus of this season, but it is those preparing to end their time as Gauchos who will have the spotlight this weekend.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face UCI Friday, Nov. 10, and UC Davis Saturday, Nov. 11. Both matches will take place at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 9, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-09/ucsb-prepares-for-final-home-matches-will-celebrate-seniors-saturday-night/","id":4962,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4961,4960,4959],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Volleyball Fall Short in Mustang Territory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WVball_vsCSUN-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This season's second installment of the Blue-Green rivalry ended with UCSB experiencing some inconsistencies while on the road.

UCSB led 19-15 late in the first set, but the Mustangs (22-2, 12-0) snatched what would have been a crucial victory away with a 12-6 run, winning the set 27-25 in extra points.</p>\n<p>Stung by the painful first-set defeat, the Gauchos flew out of the gate again in the second set with an 8-1 run. Cal Poly once again battled back, closing the gap at 17-17 and later took a 24-21 lead with a chance to win the set and likely control the match.</p>\n<p>Three straight Gaucho points staved off a potential second set loss, however, and another three-point run a little later was capped off with a Lindsey Ruddins kill that allowed UCSB to knot the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Ruddins, as usual, was the Gauchos’ leading attacker. The sophomore outside hitter posted 26 kills, and added nine digs and four blocks to balance out her statline.</p>\n<p>The final two sets of the matchup were about as tight as the first two. They just didn’t happen to work in UCSB’s favor either time.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held a late 19-18 lead after seesawing back and forth with the Mustangs for most of the third set, but that was as good as it got for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly took the next five points in a row, mostly on attack errors by UCSB, and finally won the set 25-21 to crack open a 2-1 lead in the match.</p>\n<p>That third set was the Gauchos’ worst offensively. They hit a match-low .189 for 14 kills. Their late errors were what allowed Cal Poly to surge late, a disappointing result for UCSB after leading for most of the set.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, the fourth set looked remarkably similar to the first and third sets. Just as in those earlier periods, the Mustangs won on the strength of a scoring stretch after the Gauchos started hot.</p>\n<p>This time around, UCSB didn’t trail until a Raeann Greisen kill gave Cal Poly a 15-14 lead. Once the Mustangs had the lead, they didn’t give it back up.</p>\n<p>A five-point run pushed the hosts out to a 23-16 lead, large enough to sweat out the Gauchos’ 7-2 run to close out the set and take the match.</p>\n<p>The fourth set was UCSB’s best on the attack, as they hit .289 and posted 16 kills. Cal Poly just happened to be better, with a hitting percentage of .366 and 19 kills.</p>\n<p>Sophomore middle blocker Charlie Robinson was second on UCSB with 12 kills, her best attacking effort since the team’s Sept. 29 match against CSUN. Robinson’s five total blocks was a team-best, just ahead of freshman middle blocker Nicole Omwanghe and Annie Hasselmann.</p>\n<p>Hasselmann, as UCSB’s setter, had one of her best games of the season. The junior had 54 assists and nine digs to go with her four total blocks.</p>\n<p>Four different Mustangs finished with more than ten kills, a balanced attack that UCSB was simply unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>Torrey Van Winden was the leader with 20 kills, but her sister Adlee was close behind with 13 of her own, giving the family a very strong night on the attack.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home this coming weekend with two games in the Thunderdome at 7 pm, the first against UC Irvine on Friday and the second against UC Davis on Saturday for Senior Night.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Santa Barbara is only one of four teams that have even taken a set from the Mustangs in that span.</p>\n<p>If it is going to upset the Mustangs, UCSB will need a much more consistent and well-balanced attack than what it had last time.</p>\n<p>After that sparkling first set, the Gauchos hit -.057 and .000 in the following two, which will never be sufficient against any team, let alone a powerhouse like Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We were able to keep Cal Poly below their attack average for the match,” Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch said. “That will be one key. We also need to attack at a much higher clip.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, as usual, was a one-woman wrecking ball against Cal Poly, and the Gauchos will likely need something similar to a repeat of her 21 kills, eight digs and five blocks in the rematch.</p>\n<p>Since that match, the redshirt sophomore outside hitter has been on fire, averaging 24 kills per match along with 12.75 digs per game, earning some Big West and National Awards along the way.</p>\n<p>However, Ruddins isn’t the player Santa Barbara needs to worry about.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Gauchos will need high performances from other young guns to keep up the firepower.</p>\n<p>“We had three players that didn’t really produce offensively last time,” Lantagne Welch said. “If we can get at least two more going to have four producing, that will be important.”</p>\n<p>More specifically, Welch is looking for sophomore outside hitter Chloe Allen, sophomore middle blocker Charlie Robinson and freshmen middle blockers Kija Rivers and Nicole Omwanghe to step up and produce against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Adding that attack depth would do wonders against the stout Mustang defense, but it hasn’t quite clicked for the Gauchos so far this year.</p>\n<p>Allen is coming off a 13-kill performance against Hawaii and seems fully recovered from a midseason injury.</p>\n<p>Robinson and Omwanghe have shown flashes throughout the season, with Robinson’s 129 kills placing her second on the team, but they have yet to sustain their success for an extended period.</p>\n<p>All that attacking, however, won’t do much if the Gauchos can’t contain the Cal Poly attack, led by Adlee and Torrey Van Winden.</p>\n<p>The sisters smashed through the UCSB defense back in early October, combining for 39 kills and 48 total points.</p>\n<p>“[The Van Windens] are both great players and sure will get some kills,” Lantagne Welch said. “What we have to prevent is either one of them taking over. Keep them to reasonable numbers.”</p>\n<p>Not happy with her team’s defensive performance last weekend against Hawaii, Welch has made that area of the game a focus in practice leading up to the Cal Poly match.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warriors, another Big West powerhouse, never hit below .200 in any of the four sets on Saturday, something that UCSB won’t survive a repeat of against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, the Gauchos will get a second crack at Cal Poly and another chance to pull off the major upset.</p>\n<p>All it’s going to take is excellence in every facet of the game, this time for more than one set.</p>\n<p>UCSB travels to San Luis Obispo to take on Cal Poly on Friday night at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 2nd, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79491\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79491\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-aiming-to-end-no-23-mustangs-undefeated-streak/","id":4966,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4965,4964,4963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Three-Game Win Streak Ended by Rainbow Wahine in Four-Set Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-prev.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-prev.jpg?resize=682%2C546&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to an even 5-5 record in conference play following its second loss of the season to Hawaii in four sets.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There’s little room for error against good teams and the UCSB women’s volleyball team learned that lesson the hard way Saturday evening in Rob Gym, as they fell to Hawaii in four sets (25-20, 25-22, 19-25, 25-17) thanks to some slow starts and defensive breakdowns.</p>\n<p>The loss killed the Gauchos three-game winning streak it carried into the match and dropped them to 6-16 overall, 5-5 in the Big West.

Annie Hasselmann and Charlie Robinson had two aces apiece, and the team as a whole never let the Rainbow Wahine make things interesting.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79359\" style=\"width: 288px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wvball-vshawaii-171028-dustinharris-05-web/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79359\" data-attachment-id=\"79359\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/wvball-vshawaii-171028-dustinharris-05-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=1366%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1366,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-79359\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web-683x1024.jpg?resize=278%2C417\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball-vsHawaii-171028-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?w=1366&amp;ssl=1 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79359\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Charlie Robinson swipes the ball across the opponents block. <em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“I thought the second and third sets we played really well,” UCSB head coach Nicole Welch said after the game. “We hit over 20 percent in both those sets and we put ourselves in a position to win. That’s when we started rolling.”</p>\n<p>In the next set, however, Hawaii returned the favor. The visitors came flying out of the gates and took the first seven points of the set, pushing the Gauchos onto their heels from the outset.</p>\n<p>The onslaught continued mostly unabated for a while, as the Rainbow Wahine ran out to a 16-3 lead thanks to a barrage of kills. UCSB managed to stem the flow of blood at that point, and mus red two separate five-point runs to close the gap a little bit, but the deficit was ultimately too large to overcome.</p>\n<p>“Volleyball is a funny game, it comes in waves,” Nicole Welch said. “We were just a little rough early and we had to steady out. You’d think you’d be ready and fired up, but it was just a bit off to start the match.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii managed to hit above 20 percent in all four matches, a major contributing factor to their win on Saturday. Sophomore McKenna Granato led the Rainbow Wahine attack with 21 kills, a typical result for the standout outside hitter, and added 17 digs for a solid double-double.</p>\n<p>“Probably our biggest disappointment (Saturday) was our defensive effort,” Welch said. “That’s been really strong the last week or so and we really didn’t do a good job. We weren’t following our scouting report like we wanted to.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho defense might not have been clicking the way Welch wished, but the team’s service game was almost impeccable. UCSB had a season-high 14 kills, with Hasselmann’s six leading the way.</p>\n<p>“(Hawaii) has a really good middle, so part of our strategy was if we get them out of system, we don’t have to deal with her,” Welch said. “Obviously we wanted to serve aggressively and we were going to be okay with a few errors if we went at them really hard.”</p>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins led all players Saturday with 23 kills, and the redshirt sophomore chipped in 16 blocks as well for a double-double of her own. It was an excellent performance by any measure for the outside hitter, but one that the reigning National and Big West Player of the Week has managed to make almost ho-hum, a testament to her season-long run of dominance.</p>\n<p>Outside hitter Chloe Allen, who missed eight matches with an injury in the middle of the season, seemed back to full form Saturday evening. The sophomore posted 16 kills, her second-highest total of the season, and provided the Gauchos with a formidable second weapon.</p>\n<p>“Chloe struggled the last week and she really came to life (Saturday),” Welch said. “That’s important for our team, and for our team moving forward, so that was a great plus.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next match is versus Cal Poly at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, November 3 in San Luis Obispo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/gauchos-three-game-win-streak-ended-by-rainbow-wahine-in-four-set-loss/","id":4959,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4958,4957,4956],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Revamped Gauchos Win Third Straight to End the Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-08-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"This is a new UCSB women’s volleyball team.

The Gauchos now sit atop Long Beach, UC Davis and CSUN, the three teams Santa Barbara has beaten during the team’s current win streak.</p>\n<p>Just a little over a week ago, UCSB was in a very different place. The Gauchos were coming off of a 3-1 thrashing at the hands of Cal Poly for their fourth loss in a row, and were staring up at the majority of the Big West.</p>\n<p>That feels so long ago now.</p>\n<p>“We’re just continuing to improve,” Head Coach Nicole Welch said after the match against CSUN. “We’re getting better, and we also got a couple players back that were out, so we had to deal with a lot of adversity.”</p>\n<p>In what should be a surprise to no one who has paid attention to the Gauchos this year, outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins was UCSB’s premier attacker in both of the weekend’s matches. The redshirt sophomore had 27 kills against Long Beach State and another 20 against CSUN, both team-highs.</p>\n<p>“(Lindsey) has been spectacular all week,” Lantagne Welch said. “We ask her to do a lot, and she really gave us a lot. She’s getting better at seeing the block and making really good choices, and it’s fun to see that evolve.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s stellar weekend went deeper than just Ruddins, however. Freshman Nicole Omwanghe put up a strong performance in both matches, in different aspects of the game. Omwanghe notched 11 kills, second-best on the team, against Long Beach and tied for first with seven total blocks against Northridge.</p>\n<p>Setter Annie Hasselmann was the other Gauchos with seven blocks on Saturday night, but her game was diverse as well. Hasselmann orchestrated the UCSB offense all match with 28 kills, one match after racking up a career-high 47 against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>As a whole, however, Welch wasn’t thrilled with her team’s passing even despite the successful results.</p>\n<p>“Our passing was not very good,” Lantagne Welch said. “I’m not (going to) sugarcoat it, we didn’t pass well but we actually passed better here than we did in (CSUN’s) gym because offensively we were able to sustain it.”</p>\n<p>Welch might not have liked how her charges passed, but it certainly didn’t seem to affect the Gauchos too negatively.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against Long Beach State was mostly a close battle throughout. UCSB battled back from an early deficit to take the first set, blew a small lead in the second set, and then led for the majority of both the third and fourth sets.</p>\n<p>The match against CSUN was a similar mix of drama and ease for the Gauchos, who won the first set with minimal worry. A victory in the second set, however, took an extended comeback from UCSB, who at one point trailed 17-9 and later 22-18.</p>\n<p>Welch’s worries about her team’s passing aside, the Gauchos looked like a team reborn over the weekend, something that they’ll look to continue into the future. UCSB is staring at a difficult slate of upcoming games, as they’ll take on Hawaii, then Cal Poly and finally UC Irvine in the next two weeks.

Compare that to the Aggies, who had three players above ten kills and another with eight, and UCSB’s lack of attack diversity is stark.</p>\n<p>That didn’t matter on Tuesday night, however. Ruddins was all the offensive power the Gauchos needed, finishing with her second-highest kill total in a four-set match all season. The redshirt sophomore also led UCSB with 15 digs in her sixth double-double match of the season and her second in Big West play.</p>\n<p>Counting Tuesday night, Ruddins has led the Gauchos in kills in 14 of the team’s 19 games, and has done so in every Big West match thus far. Tuesday night’s result was just one of the more extreme occurrences of what has become a major trend for UCSB.</p>\n<p>To be clear, though, the win over the Aggies was not just a one-woman show. Libero Emilia Petrarchi also registered double-digit digs with 10. Petrarchi has finished with at least 10 kills in every game so far this season, a streak that’s landed the junior in the top-50 nationally in digs per set. She enter the weekday match No. 42 in the nation with a 4.94 average.</p>\n<p>Annie Hasselmann had a game-high 40 assists in her role as UCSB’s setter, the player who sets Ruddins up to post her wild statlines. Hasselmann put up a well-balanced statline of five kills, five digs and a service ace to go with her pile of assists, serving as a sort of Swiss Army knife for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB hit at a .242 percentage, the team’s highest rate since its loss to Cal State Northridge on Sept. 9. It was the ninth time the Gauchos cracked the .200 threshold all season. Unsurprisingly, all four of the Gauchos’ wins have come in games they’ve hit at a clip above that mark.</p>\n<p>UC Davis was only a beat behind UCSB in hitting percentage, as the Aggies hit at a .238 clip. That .004 gap, along with the Gauchos’ seven service aces, helped make the difference. UCD had more kills than UCSB in the final set, but the Aggies’ eight errors to Santa Barbara’s four doomed the hosts.</p>\n<p>They might have only needed four sets to take the win, but the Gauchos were never truly comfortable on Tuesday night. Their largest lead was five, which the Aggies promptly turned into a one-point deficit over the next four points.</p>\n<p>The final set was intense and went back-and-forth, with the Gauchos managing only an 18-14 lead as their largest advantage. Just as they had done when down five, UCD quickly cleaned up the deficit, this time tying the match up at 18.</p>\n<p>Both teams played continuously exchanged points down the stretch of that fourth set. Davis managed to take a 23-22 lead, its first advantage since it led 4-3 early on, but UCSB won four of the next five points to clinch the match.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is a back-to-back against Long Beach State on Friday, followed by Cal State Northridge on Saturday night. Both games will begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome, and will give the Gauchos two chances to avenge earlier conference losses to both opponents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79172\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79172\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-18/womens-volleyball-ends-its-4-match-skid-with-win-over-uc-davis/","id":4957,"author":{"id":17,"name":"Spencer Ault"},"related":[4956,4955,4954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to End Losing Streak at UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2017-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FILEPHOTO-WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FILEPHOTO-WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-01-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's volleyball team has lost four games in a row and will look to change that against fifth-place UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB and UC Davis women’s volleyball teams are going in opposite directions.</p>\n<p>After losing their last four games, the Gauchos are quickly sinking in the Big West.

It was a disappointing result for Head Coach Nicole Welch’s squad, but there were positive elements to build off of leading into Tuesday’s match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ passing, one of Coach Welch’s points of emphasis leading into Saturday’s match, was much improved against the Mustangs, and UCSB was able to take the first set from a juggernaut Cal Poly squad. The visitors ran off the next three to leave the Thunderdome with a win, but it certainly wasn’t all doom and gloom for the hosts.</p>\n<p>Of course, a hitting percentage of .119 won’t be enough to come away with a win on Tuesday, just like it wasn’t on Saturday. UCSB has cracked .200 in only eight of its 18 games this season, and odds are the Gauchos are going to need to make it nine if they want to have a chance against UCD.</p>\n<p>The Aggies have taken advantage of the Big West bottom-feeders recently, with all three of their consecutive wins coming against the three worst teams in the conference. A win over the sixth-place Gauchos would keep that run going.</p>\n<p>With five players boasting over 100 kills so far this season, the UCD attack is about as balanced as UCSB will see this season. Freshman outside hitter Mahalia White is top of the bunch with 231 kills at a 3.08 per set clip, impressive numbers for a true freshman.</p>\n<p>Junior outside hitter Emily Allen is second to White with 199 kills but possesses a more well-rounded game than her younger counterpart. Allen is tied for third on the team with 14 service aces, and her 209 digs are good enough for second on the Aggie team.</p>\n<p>If White and Allen aren’t enough, UCD can also depend on junior outside hitter Brianna Karseboom, sophomore outside hitter Lauren Matias or junior middle blocker Kelechi Ohiri, all fellow members of the 100-kill club, to bring the thunder on the attack. The depth extends to the setter position as well: junior Maddie Merlino (422 assists) and freshman Paloma Bowman (367) are both reliable passers and conduits for the offense to flow through.</p>\n<p>Davis has hardly been a team of world-beaters this year, but they’ll enter Tuesday’s match with a lot more steam than UCSB. Where the Aggies simply will be looking to maintain their winning ways, the Gauchos must strive to mine the good out of their recent losses while leaving the bad behind.</p>\n<p>The clock is running out on UCSB’s season, but a victory on Tuesday would add a little more much-needed time.

Cal Poly won the first point on a Savannah Niemen kill after an extended rally featuring several saves for both sides.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs charged out to an early lead thanks to a couple UCSB errors but returned the favor with three of their own in short order. Lindsey Ruddins put the Gauchos ahead 15-14 with a powerful kill off an assist from setter Emilia Petrachi, but Cal Poly didn’t go quietly.</p>\n<p>The two teams traded kills back and forth for the next few minutes, although UCSB was able to build a 22-19 lead, putting themselves at the doorstep of a surprise first-set victory.</p>\n<p>Two kills from Torrey Van Winden and another from Raeann Greisen evened things back up, however, putting the heat back on the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Neither team was able to build the requisite two-point advantage, instead of exchanging kills as they pushed past the 25-point mark. Star outside hitter Ruddins contributed a handful of kills, while setter Annie Hasselmann caught the Mustangs off guard with a surprise spike to give UCSB a 26-25 lead.</p>\n<p>Torrey Van Winden once again tied the set up after Hasselmann’s kill with one of her own, but the ensuing Ruddins kill pushed the Gauchos out ahead once again. Van Winden responded with an attack error, securing a 28-26 set victory for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Hyped up on their strong start against likely the best team they’ll play all season, the Gauchos jumped out to a 7-5 lead in the second set. That’s when the Mustangs woke up. Cal Poly won the next 13 points, and eventually pulled out a 25-15 set victory.</p>\n<p>The third set looked remarkably similar to the second. UCSB led 4-3 early, but then watched the Mustangs run off the next nine points. The rest of the set was fairly back and forth, but that was all Cal Poly needed to coast to a 25-16 victory.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final set didn’t have a similar Cal Poly run, but the result was largely the same as the prior two sets. Rather than ride a sudden explosion to victory, the Mustangs simply wore the Gauchos down on their way to a 25-15 clinching win.</p>\n<p>Ruddins, as has been the case throughout the season, led UCSB in kills with 21, the only Gaucho in double digits. Hasselmann set up the bulk of those kills, finishing with 31 assists.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s sibling duo of Torrey and Adlee Van Winden proved to be too much Van Winden for UCSB to handle. The sisters combined for 39 kills, 21 for Torrey and 18 for Adlee, who had seven blocks as well.</p>\n<p>No other Mustang cracked 10 kills, although setter Taylor Nelson did post a double-double of 47 assists and 10 digs. As a team, Cal Poly hit at a .279 rate, far outstripping the Gauchos and their .119 clip.</p>\n<p>“I thought we had a good effort and we just have to improve,” Welch said. “We have had a lot of adversity this season but we have to take the hand we are dealt, focus on improving. We are putting the effort in and now we just want to execute.”</p>\n<p>UCSB must now turn its attention to UC Davis, as the Gauchos travel to Davis to take on the 11-9, 3-4 Aggies for the first time this season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Cal Poly is returning to the AVCA National Top 25 for the first time since 2008, when the Mustangs were No. 22.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The visitors will enter the Thunderdome as winners of their last 11 consecutive games, including wins over then No. 20 Wichita State and defending Big West champion Hawai’i.</p>\n<p>Things are not quite as favorable on the Gaucho side of the equation as UCSB lost its last three matches in addition to having already lost nine of its last 10 sets played.<br>\nSanta Barbara will look to bounce back from being swept in four of its last five contests. Even with such results, the season is far from over.</p>\n<p>Two wins against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton to open up Big West play gave the Gauchos a bit of a cushion to afford to lose their last three games, but they don’t have much left. A loss to Cal Poly would push UCSB underwater, with a difficult path back up to the .500 mark in the conference.</p>\n<p>To beat the Mustangs, the Gauchos must focus on at least limiting the attacking power of the high-flying sibling duo of Torrey and Adlee Van Winden.</p>\n<p>The Van Windens are Cal Poly’s best outside hitters with a combined 498 kills this season. Torrey’s 278 kills gives her the edge on her younger sister’s 220, but Adlee has an advantage in service aces with five more, 22 to 17.</p>\n<p>However, Cal Poly is more than just a sideshow.</p>\n<p>Two different attackers, seniors Raeann Greisen and Savannah Niemen, both boast over 100 kills and kill per set ratios of over two. Senior setter Taylor Nelson keeps the Mustang machine in motion with her 12.03 assists per set, which is fourth best in the nation.</p>\n<p>“[Cal Poly has] a great setter and a great offense,” UCSB head coach Nicole Welch said. “And we just have to have everybody do their part because they’re going to have some “wow” kills and we have to be okay with that and take care of the ones we can handle.”</p>\n<p>The array of attacking options, plus the setting abilities of Nelson, has provided the push behind the Mustangs’ torrid start to the season.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly appears motivated to break through after two-straight third-place conference finishes, and the Gauchos now stand squarely in their path.</p>\n<p>“Playing Cal Poly is always going to bring out a lot of excitement and aggression from our side,” UCSB head coach Nicole Welch said. “We just want to play clean volleyball, and be better this week than we were last week.”</p>\n<p>After managing just one win in 12 non-conference tries, it seemed as though UCSB had found a higher gear when the team won its first two Big West games.</p>\n<p>Three-straight road losses – to Cal State Northridge, UC Irvine and Hawai’i – have brought the Gauchos back to Earth, but there’s still time to make noise with 11 conference games remaining.</p>\n<p>“When we struggled on that road weekend, for CSUN and Long Beach, our passing kind of broke down,” Welch said. “That’s one of our strengths, so we’ve been working to get that better, and it was much better against Hawai’i and we played a much better match.”</p>\n<p>That count includes Saturday’s match against Cal Poly, likely UCSB’s toughest opponent of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need standout performances from all their top players in order to avoid being trampled by the Mustang stampede.</p>\n<p>Top on the list of standouts is redshirt sophomore outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins. Ruddins’s average of 5.42 kills per set is top in the Big West, and second-best in the nation. Junior setter Annie Hasselmann has set Ruddins up for the majority of those kills, and has a total of 467 assists this season.</p>\n<p>Junior defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi has filled her role perfectly as well, piling up a team high 317 digs at a rate of 5.20 per set. That’s the 28th best rate in the nation and the best rate in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Beating a juggernaut like Cal Poly, however, requires near-perfect execution from every player that touches the court, not just the traditional torch-bearers.</p>\n<p>That’s been lacking from this year’s iteration of Gauchos, but that’s what it will take to stop the skid and breathe new life into the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly on Saturday evening at 5 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily

The redshirt junior guard was forced to sit all last year thanks to NCAA transfer rules but was a dominant force once she got on the court this year.</p>\n<p>Toler was at the center of the comeback with 12 points and five rebounds in the second half alone, and her three-pointer served as the climax of a 32-11 UCSB second half run.</p>\n<p>Seemingly awakened by UCSB’s surprise surge, the 49ers fought back, going 3-4 from the field while turning up the defensive intensity once again. Toler and LBSU guard Madison Montgomery went back and forth, trading baskets as the clock ticked down.</p>\n<p>Toler drew two shooting fouls with under a minute left and knocked down two of her four free throws. It wasn’t enough to give the Gauchos the lead, but it was enough to bring them within one shot of the win.</p>\n<p>UCSB got that one shot, a corner three-pointer from junior guard Sarah Porter, but the ball hit the lip of the rim and fell off. The miss gave Long Beach the win and the bid to the NCAA Tournament, a program first for the 49ers.</p>\n<p>Despite not winning the match, the game between UCSB and LBSU was an instant classic to all those who attended and definitely lit a fire in Porter, Toler and the rest of this squad to change this script next year.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 8 of the June 8, 2017,

Despite their many early draft picks, Cleveland hasn’t seen a winning season since 2007 and the playoffs since 2002.</p>\n<p>This example of mediocrity shows us fans one thing: It’s time to abolish the NFL draft.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I’d like to abolish the NBA and NHL drafts as well, while we’re at it, but for now I’m willing to settle for just the NFL.</p>\n<p>As currently constituted, the NFL draft incentivizes losing and denies incoming players any sort of agency when it comes to their salary or workplace. All that and the draft doesn’t even really improve parity of a league that has seen many of the same teams make the playoffs year in and year out.</p>\n<p>Under the rules of the NFL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement, rookies are the best deals in the league. That’s because their contracts are constrained by the rookie wage scale, which keeps their first-year salaries artificially low so teams could get a great investment.</p>\n<p>Per the terms of the CBA, each team has a rookie pool it can spend on its draft picks, with the size of the pool descending as the picks get lower. Spotrac estimates that the Browns will only be able to offer the first overall pick a contract worth a total of $30 million over four years.</p>\n<p>That’s a whole lot less compared to former first overall pick Sam Bradford’s $76 million contract given to him by the then St. Louis Rams after drafting him in 2010, which is, understandably, upsetting to this year’s pick (Myles Garrett, if the Browns are smart) since he would earn probably double without the rookie wage scale.</p>\n<p>In fact, the rookie wage scale only exists because teams went overboard with their rookie deals prior to its implementation, such as in the case of Bradford, who only spent four years in St. Louis throwing for only 11,065 yards, 59 touchdowns and 38 interceptions for a very average 80.1 quarterback rating.</p>\n<p>This wage scale makes it so that rookies are the most cost-effective commodities in the NFL. Oakland Raiders defensive end Khalil Mack, for instance, who won the Defensive Player of the Year award last season, is still on his rookie deal, a four-year contract worth $18 million, per Spotrac. Von Miller, the player Mack beat out for DPOY last season, currently has a six-year $114.5 million contract. In 2017, Mack provided the Raiders with Von Miller-level production for just 15 percent of the price.</p>\n<p>No wonder teams like the Browns choose to tank. Only through the draft can teams find elite talent that costs as much as a middling veteran.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the draft system, NFL teams have a strong incentive to tank in order to secure a high pick. In my mind, any system that encourages losing is a broken system that requires major reformation.</p>\n<p>That reformation doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, it’s as easy as simply making incoming players free agents and creating a set rookie-free agency period.</p>\n<p>This change would wipe out any incentive to lose and would allow all teams to compete to sign the best rookie talents. There would be no rookie wage scale to artificially depress the wages of players like Khalil Mack and players would at last have the ability to choose where they want to start their careers.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the new rookie system would work like college recruiting. Teams, starting with the opening of the rookie-signing period, would work to court the top rookies of each class with fat contracts and promises of playing time, and each player would be able to choose from a variety of suitors.</p>\n<p>The existing salary cap would still be in place to act as a restriction on any one team’s ambitions during the rookie free-agency period.<br>\nSure, the Cowboys might be able to attract more rookie interest than other teams, but they’d only be able to sign as many top rookies as they could fit under the salary cap.</p>\n<p>Bad teams like the Browns would still have somewhat of an advantage in the new order, given their large amounts of cap space. All that space would come in handy when competing for the top rookies. Myles Garrett might love Texas, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to turn down additional tens of millions of dollars the Browns or 49ers can offer him.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the new rookie system would prioritize and reward smart teams.</p>\n<p>There are undervalued gems like Julian Edelman and Antonio Brown in every draft, players who in the new system would be available for cheap. While the Cowboys might go around pulling in one or two big names with big deals, other teams could snap up lots of these low-cost, high-value players. It’s what the Patriots and Steelers have been doing for years.</p>\n<p>Shifting from a draft to a rookie free-agency period would be a massive, but necessary, shift. It’s high time that the NFL and the NFLPA give rookies some actual power upon entering the league.</p>\n<p>Abolishing the draft would do that while simultaneously eliminating losing incentives in the NFL.

The last name Boehle appeared three times on the 2017 UCSB men’s volleyball roster, as Hayden, now a junior, and Davis, a freshman redshirt, defied the odds and embraced the timing to join their older brother.</p>\n<p>“It started getting a little better when [Hayden and Davis] started getting recruited,” Parker said. “I was like, ‘Wow, this might actually happen’… And now here we all are. It’s pretty crazy.”</p>\n<p>The 2017 season, which recently ended with the Gauchos going 10-16 overall and missing out on the MPSF postseason tournament, didn’t go exactly as the Boehles might have hoped. Davis never actually got to see the court at the same time as his brothers, as he followed in Parker’s footsteps by redshirting his freshman season.</p>\n<p>That said, being on the same team and on the same campus washed away some of the stings for the Boehle trio. Years of playing and living together created a bond that goes beyond that of normal teammates, something that shows on the court.</p>\n<p>“We know we have our backs,” Davis said. “We know we’re there for each other. When we’re down, we pick each other up. You just know that you have your best friend on the court with you.”</p>\n<p>Parker, Hayden, and Davis didn’t just stumble upon volleyball by accident. Michael Boehle, their father, is in his 19th year as head coach of the boy’s volleyball team at Loyola High School, currently the top team in the nation. All three Boehle boys played for their father there, but their volleyball roots go even deeper than just high school.</p>\n<p>“We all started playing when we were super young,” Hayden said. “We have a little grass court in our backyard, so we started probably when we were around eight to 10.”</p>\n<p>Michael Boehle, naturally, played a pivotal role in cultivating his three sons’ love for the game. The elder Boehle played beach volleyball professionally back in the day and has won six CIF Southern Section titles at the helm of the Loyola squad. A resume like that gives a dad a lot to teach his kids about the sport.</p>\n<p>“He’s probably the most important person in my career in terms of volleyball,” Parker said. “He taught me the game. He showed me how to compete and how to lead.”</p>\n<p>Volleyball isn’t just a boy’s thing in the Boehle family, however. Parker, Hayden, and Davis have a younger sister named Ella, who is currently a junior on the volleyball team at Notre Dame Academy in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“It’s been pretty funny watching her grow up and be able to compete with us in the backyard,” Davis said. “She used to have to watch from the sidelines, but now she can hold her own with us.”</p>\n<p>There’s only one non-volleyballer in the Boehle clan: Lisa Boehle, mother of UCSB’s sibling triangle. That doesn’t stop her from joining in on backyard matches, though.</p>\n<p>“She’s probably the only one in our entire family who can’t play volleyball,” Parker said. “We give her a hard time, but she’ll go out there and she has fun with it. She’s a great sport.”</p>\n<p>As might be expected, the shared volleyball upbringing has left the Boehle brothers with some similarities as players. All three consider ball control one of their greatest strengths as well as volleyball IQ.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76901\" style=\"width: 391px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76901\" data-attachment-id=\"76901\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/hayden-boehle-swings-over-the-top-of-the-block-eric-swenson-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/FEAT-03-11-MensVballLewis-EricSwensonNexus-17-print.jpg?fit=1863%2C1863&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1863,1863\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Hayden Boehle swings over the top of the block.

Hayden plays outside hitter for the most part, while Parker and Davis both play at the libero position. That pattern carries over to communication, as Parker and Davis both outtalk the middle sibling on the court by a significant amount.</p>\n<p>Indeed, all three brothers noted an every-other pattern in their family. Parker and Davis look and act alike, while Hayden and Ella share some major characteristics between each other.</p>\n<p>“Hayden’s a lot like my sister,” Parker said. “It’s kind of like me and Davis and then Hayden and my sister; the two pairs have a lot of similar traits. My sister kind of acts like Hayden did when he was in high school, and then I see a lot of things that Davis does that I used to do back then.”</p>\n<p>“We look alike,” Davis said of his similarities to Parker. “Literally, there will be times where we think the same thing without knowing it and be like, ‘Wow, that’s kind of crazy.’”</p>\n<p>Parker and Davis do bear a major resemblance to one another, with one small difference: Davis’ broken nose. That’s thanks to none other than Hayden, who smashed a ball right through Davis’ hands in a backyard volleyball match.</p>\n<p>Anyone with siblings can tell you that such injuries are just a part of life growing up, and Davis certainly doesn’t seem to hold a grudge against his brother for the incident. At least Gaucho volleyball fans had better hope he doesn’t since they’ll be sharing a court come next season.</p>\n<p>Hayden and Davis will carry on without Parker, who played out his last year of eligibility this past season.
