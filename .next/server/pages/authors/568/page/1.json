The news was applauded at home by raucous Americans outside the White House, at a Phillies-Mets baseball game and in small towns everywhere. The victims of September 11, 2001 have finally received justice. But even justice cannot provide complete closure for the families torn apart by Osama bin Laden’s crimes. “[I have] a feeling of happiness, but not jump-up-and-down happiness,” said September 11 widower Charles Wolf. “The idea of closure is something that really, really — it doesn’t exist, to tell you the truth.”</p>\n<p>We must not let our exuberance distract us from protecting our families, spouses and friends from future potential attacks. Even Sunday’s arrival of justice cannot replace the victims’ loved ones forever lost from their lives. Osama bin Laden’s and his followers’ crimes have victimized families in Kenya/Tanzania (1998), America (2001), Spain (2003) and India (2008). Sunday’s justice assuaged the pain inflicted not just upon America, but upon humanity worldwide. It was a somber day of justice delivered by America to families around the world.</p>\n<p>However, preventing future innocents from suffering is a much more demanding duty than executing a military mission. America and its allies must continue to dismantle, disrupt and defeat Islamist extremists. More importantly, America must continue to strengthen mutually beneficial relationships with all Muslims. No amount of air-drone strikes can defeat an al-Qaeda with an endless recruitment stream. Events like the Iraq War have only increased the number of terrorists working to kill Christians, Jews and Muslims in places like Madrid and Mumbai. Prevention is one of the most difficult duties, but it is also the most imperative duty because no amount of justice, not even Osama bin Laden’s death, can replace a loved one lost to terrorism.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37595\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37595\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-03/prevention-replaces-justice-priority/","id":6201,"author":{"id":568,"name":"David Kornahrens"},"related":[6200,6199,6198],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/568"}},"__N_SSG":true}
