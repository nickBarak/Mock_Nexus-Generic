I love my country, I love this country, I love other countries too, I love the world,“ Boogie said.</p>\n<p>According to Boogie, the series aims to uplift everyone, including those who are affluent and don’t experience many societal issues present today.<br>\n“I don’t see them tearing down, I see them lifting up and being uplifting,“Boogie said. “If somebody wants to take them that personal, that’s their personal prerogative. That’s my whole point of this entire series: solutions.”</p>\n<p>Boogie said he wants his art to provide viewers with new perspectives to prevalent issues.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69586\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69586\" data-attachment-id=\"69586\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/print-night-4-5-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bipartisan Art 4-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-69586\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C588\" alt=\"Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Print-Night-4-5-8.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69586\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“Of course, yeah, it opens up hearts, minds, bodies and souls to a whole new perspective that they either didn’t care about, or they do care about and they’re just so engulfed in the one way versus the 100 million other ways that are out there,” Boogie said. “Critical thinking, that’s all I ask for.”</p>\n<p>Boogie said the installment was in part a collaboration between him and Nirmal Mulye, the commissioner of the paintings.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, he gives some input but he puts in a good 20 percent vs. my 80 percent. The artwork is all my concepts,“ Boogie said. „He wanted a broader perspective of exposing the truth, exposing what’s really going on out there. He comes from a background of nothing, to basically starting his own businesses out here in America, and doing a lot of interesting things politically-wise.”</p>\n<p>Boogie said people are capable of finding solutions to the political, social, economic and religious divisions present in America.</p>\n<p>“I know we’re doing it, but [people are] using money and politics to push it in a certain direction versus ‘yo man, we need to do something about that or something drastically bad is going to happen,” Boogie said. “So that can go for a lot of these topics whether it’s immigration laws, education, religion … it’s endless bro”</p>\n<p>Boogie believes that should people throughout the world overcome their differences, solutions can be created and enacted.</p>\n<p>“Of course the world, ya know, I think everybody should be on the same page, but it’s not always gonna work like that. There’s so much diversity and different perspectives. If we can just create certain solutions that mold with that diversity, we should be good, ya know? Nothing’s gonna be perfect. Let’s just use some critical thinking with a little bit of precaution. Let’s be discerning.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, April 7 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69604\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69604\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/arbor-art-piece-takes-on-politcal-divisions/","id":2525,"author":{"id":150,"name":"Noah Sayres"},"related":[2524,2523,2522],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/150"}},"__N_SSG":true}
