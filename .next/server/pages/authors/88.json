Now, Carlton-Carew can add fashion designer and human rights advocate to her resume.</p>\n<p>The T-shirts were created by Carlton-Carew to promote the upcoming premiere of her documentary series, titled “America Show Me Your Hands,” which will be released on YouTube within the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a mini docuseries that will analyze certain social issues going on within America and what Americans think we should do to fix those issues that are occuring within our environment or our community,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really just about holding each other accountable for our future.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the meaning behind the phrase “America Show Me Your Hands,” Carlton-Carew said she associated it with a mother catching her child sneaking a cookie from the cookie jar and asking them to show her their hands.</p>\n<p>“It’s more engaging that way, it’s in a loving way; I want people to be transparent with each other because I want people to have conversations [about social issues],” she said.</p>\n<p>The series will be comprised of short 15-minute films. It will spotlight relevant social and political issues circulating the country including sexism, racism, healthcare, affordable education and housing, among other topics.</p>\n<p>The first episode will address xenophobia, the dislike or fear of people from foreign countries, a topic that is one of personal interest to Carlton-Carew, whose parents are both from Sierra Leone, West Africa.</p>\n<p>A large portion of the episode will highlight the effects of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) on its recipients.</p>\n<p>“Temporary Protected Status allows certain people from certain countries to come to America if they’re seeking asylum, or their country experienced natural disasters or if it is unsafe for them to be there,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew, whose mother came to the United States under TPS in the 1990s as a result of the Sierra Leone Civil War, experienced firsthand the confusion that arises among the recipients when their status is terminated.</p>\n<p>Prior to President Trump’s administration, when a country that was originally granted TPS was deemed safe once again, the government would notify the recipients but then fail to enforce any action to send them back to their native country.</p>\n<p>They also would not provide them with the steps necessary to apply for citizenship in America, according to Carlton-Carew.</p>\n<p>Currently refugees from Haiti, El Salvador, Nepal and Honduras who have sought refuge in America to escape natural disasters and violence within their countries have been notified that they need to leave between 2019 and 2020 or face deportation, according to Carlton-Carew.</p>\n<p>Through “America Show Me Your Hands,” Carlton-Carew aims to promote transparency and accountability between Americans in regards to these intense topics.</p>\n<p>“I want empathy; I want people to be able to understand each other’s situations. The only reason why I am where I am today is because Americans in my community didn’t look at my mother and I as strangers … they embraced us as Americans should do and they made sure that we felt welcome,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>The first episode will consist primarily of Carlton-Carew’s own story in regards to xenophobia, along with news clippings and photos of children from Honduras and Nepal that she received from a photographer who traveled there.</p>\n<p>The following episode, tackling affordable housing, will feature testimonials from college students who recognize the issue in their society and have begun taking steps to effect change in their community.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew wanted to create the film series during her first year at UCSB. However, it was only recently that she decided on a specific format and film topics and began to act on her ideas.</p>\n<p>“I started getting more involved in politics, and given our political climate I thought this was the most appropriate time. I couldn’t sit on this idea any longer –– I had to pursue it,” Carlton-Carew said.</p>\n<p>Her decision to become involved in A.S. was largely a result of her desire to see more film major representation within Senate.</p>\n<p>As first pro-tempore and off-campus senator, Carlton-Carew aspires to not only be a liaison between the student body and their senators but also to promote increased opportunities for student filmmakers.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew hopes to reach young adults with her T-shirts and documentaries in an effort to empower them.</p>\n<p>“I just want to empower young people to take charge of their future. By interviewing them, it puts them on a platform to engage with other people who might find [their stories] interesting.”</p>\n<p>As her following grows, Carlton-Carew, who designs the merchandise with her mom, aims to expand her products to include both hats and laptop stickers.</p>\n<p>“I want people to [see my shirt] and think about what it means,” Carlton-Carew said. “This is our future … America, show me your hands.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Each featured category will also have its own sub-section such as poetry, prose, drawings, paintings and sculptures, Woo said.</p>\n<p>“Um…” Magazine’s editorial team hopes to have print editions of their content by Winter Quarter 2019, according to Woo.</p>\n<p>While the magazine does plan on having consistent writers on their team, Woo said the majority of the content they wish to include will be submitted by students themselves, which will hopefully showcase students’ own personal struggles and stories.</p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to submit content will be allowed to do so, according to Woo.</p>\n<p>“The magazine would prioritize [marginalized] people… but won’t exclude anyone who wanted to submit content,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We hope to give voices to those [marginalized] groups and opinions that don’t see as much light without feeling it necessary to censor or change what they have to say regardless of who’s listening,” the magazine’s Gofundme page states.</p>\n<p>Woo’s hope is that the magazine will turn into a community rather than just a publication.

They also draw pictures that convey their emotions in a healthy and metaphorical way, Morgan said. <em>Courtesy of Michael Morgan</em></p></div>\n<p>For the program, Morgan brings together eight UCSB students and eight incarcerated teenagers from Los Prietos Boys’ Camp (LPBC), a juvenile detention facility in Santa Barbara County. He uses theater, dance and art techniques to address issues related to class and culture.</p>\n<p>The class spends six weeks rehearsing their own rendition of Homer’s <em>Odyssey </em>from June 25 to August 4. At the end of the course, participants perform at Center Stage Theater in downtown Santa Barbara, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The program grew out of a class called “The People’s Voice,” which is also taught by Morgan and is offered during Summer Session A.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the class was to create a partnership between UCSB undergraduates and the community,” Morgan said. “It’s theater with a social justice bent.”</p>\n<p>The class is six weeks long and meets Tuesday through Thursday for about four hours each day, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>This program, which is the first and only of its kind, was started in 2011 when Morgan was looking for a way to bridge the gap between “privileged” and “non-privileged” people in the community.</p>\n<p>He said he wanted to create a space where they could interact in a way that promoted deeper communication and understanding between both sides, which is the basis for<em> The Odyssey Project</em>.</p>\n<p>“Coming from … my own background, I understand some of the difficulties people have to face if they’re not always privileged,” Morgan said.</p>\n<p>Morgan, who has been a lecturer at UCSB since1992, said he chose to focus on <em>The Odyssey </em>for his program because he felt it had a storyline that both students and troubled teens could relate to.</p>\n<p>“They become the heroes and heroines in their journey home to Ithaca,” he said.</p>\n<p>The students and incarcerated teenagers that participate in this program write stories about the struggles they currently deal with. They also draw pictures that convey their emotions in a healthy and metaphorical way, Morgan said.</p>\n<p>Morgan is the primary professor of the course, but also gets help from a mime teacher, mask maker, hip-hop choreographer, rap artist and costume designer.</p>\n<p>The location of the class alternates between UCSB and LPBC, which is located in Los Padres National Forest. This allows UCSB students to receive more context about the world and what the life of an incarcerated teenager is like, Morgan said.</p>\n<p>“There’s this location exchange, but also there’s a kind of cultural exchange because we have … the free and the incarcerated in a dialogue,” he explained. “The UC students benefit from [the program] because … [the teens and students] start to bond with each other.”</p>\n<p>Youth who are admitted into LPBC stay there for either 120 or 180 days, according to the LPBC website.</p>\n<p>“The goal of LPBC is to return youth to the community as responsible and productive members of society,” the website states.</p>\n<p>Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 are admitted into LPBC and are expected to attend the camp’s school while they are there, according to the website.</p>\n<p>Morgan said one of his main hopes is that the theater program will inspire teens who graduate from LPBC to go to college afterwards.</p>\n<p>“I usually take youth age 16 to 17. It’s an important transition in their life because … if they continue to violate [the law] basically they go to adult prisons,” Morgan said.</p>\n<p>There have been numerous accounts in which incarcerated teens work toward getting into college after completing the <em>The Odyssey Project,</em> according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>“[This program] show[ed] me that we could mature ourselves. We could work, not be lazy. We can go to college, have a good job and get good money instead of being on the streets and selling drugs. That’s not going to get you anywhere,” said Diego, a youth who attended the program in 2015.</p>\n<p>Morgan said he believes the performance the students and teenagers put on at the end of the course encourages community members and political leaders in Santa Barbara to address these teenagers in a more compassionate way.</p>\n<p>Relatives and friends of the actors, as well as community groups and leaders, attend this typically sold-out show, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The people in the crowd can “really make a difference” in the lives of the teenagers who perform, Morgan said.</p>\n<p>“Once [the students and teenagers] do that show… they’re throwing a ball to the public saying … ‘They also need to step up to us, we’re a part of that society,’” he said.</p>\n<p>This year, Morgan expanded this project to a maximum security correctional facility in Ventura County. The men at this facility range in age from 17 to 22. Due to safety concerns, the practices and performance are held within the correctional grounds.</p>\n<p>This “abbreviated” version of the program is four weeks long and is currently underway, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge in organizing the class and performance is “getting the word out” and getting students from UCSB to participate in this kind of work, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>Morgan has begun to write up a “training manual” for this course that includes the strategies employed so that other people can start similar programs as well. He is also producing a documentary to spread awareness about the project.</p>\n<p>The possibility of continuation for the project will be determined in following years by enrollment numbers, funding and the amount of help from other staff members, according to Morgan.</p>\n<p>The next performance of <em>The Odyssey Project </em>at the Ventura location is scheduled for June 8.</p>\n<p><em>A

all the work that came with it lived up to her expectations.</p>\n<p>“I felt like I had a lot of insight coming into office … I made sure I knew what I was getting myself into,” she said.</p>\n<p>Her position as UC Santa Barbara’s external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) required her to advocate on behalf of the student body to the University of California Regents, UC Office of the President and other partner organizations with Associated Students (A.S.).</p>\n<p>Hsu told the <em>Nexus</em> she believes she successfully addressed all of her campaign platforms during her year in office.</p>\n<p>She ran on a platform of advocating to legislators for the “rights, resources, and representation of students across the state and nation.”</p>\n<p>During her time as EVPSA, Hsu focused on preventing a tuition increase for the 2018-2019 school year that the UC Regents were planning to impose in response to the lack of state funding.</p>\n<p>Hsu went on a number of advocacy trips throughout the year to advocate on behalf of UCSB students to encourage the UC Regents to listen to student needs including advocating for bills regarding sexual assault, violence and harassment on campus.</p>\n<p>Because of the work Hsu and other student advocates have been doing to prevent this increase, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-29/uc-regents-postpone-vote-on-tuition-hike/\">postponed the vote</a> to raise in-state tuition until the end of May and have instead begun partnering with students to advocate for more funding from the state, Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Hsu, along with UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang, A.S. President Hieu Le and other university members went to Sacramento to meet with legislators and lobby for “budget asks and what [A.S.] determines to be priorities.”</p>\n<p>The group asked legislators for $140 million to address “deferred maintenance, over enrollment [for the 2017-18 school year] and buying out the tuition increase.”</p>\n<p>The latter was in response to Governor Brown’s proposed budget for the UC, which was significantly less than the Regents expected.</p>\n<p>The results of their efforts will be seen in June when the legislators create a budget for the UC and submit it to the House and Senate.</p>\n<p>In addition to lobbying for students, Hsu promised to “advocate for the establishment of a campus-based Middle Class Scholarship for UCSB students as a response to the elimination of the CA Middle Class Scholarship.”</p>\n<p>Initially, Brown planned to eliminate it, but later decided not to following public and legislative backlash.</p>\n<p>Since the scholarship was never eliminated a replacement was not necessary to implement, Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also fulfilled her goal of bringing all candidates running for California Governor to UCSB to speak with students.</p>\n<p>Governor Candidate Delaine Eastin visited UCSB on Earth Day, Antonio Villaraigosa will be visiting in a few weeks, and both John Chiang and Gavin Newsom are planning to visit before the June 5 primaries, according to Hsu.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s final platform item stated she would “collaborate with key state and student organizers to work on a system-wide campaign to reclaim the cost of higher education during the 2018 election.” Hsu said she has worked with Reclaim California’s Higher Education Coalition throughout the school year to create an informational video, released in October, that explains how people of all backgrounds can achieve higher education.</p>\n<p>“In some shape or form I have responded to all my platorm points,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said she is most proud of helping unite students voices at UCSB with state legislators who can make changes to the higher education system, specifically in regards to their fight for increased budgets.</p>\n<p>“It’s always been a struggle of whether these powers or institutions or higher authorities will take students seriously,” she said. “I think this year the work that UCSB students have done really shows that we are a force to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Hsu said the money the EVPSA’s office received for the 2017-2018 school year went to funding their advocacy trips and events the office hosted throughout the year, including the GOP tax panel last fall, which featured Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>“This panel was set to inform people about how [the GOP tax] would affect both undergraduate and graduate students alike,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu also partnered with Rose Le, the EVPSA office’s mental health coordinator, to organize a panel for the science, technology, engineering and mathematics students on campus to aid them in maintaining their mental health amidst the stresses of their heavy class load.</p>\n<p>Nushi Yapabandara, the Re-Ignite coordinator for EVPSA, praised Hsu and the rest of the team for the work they were able to accomplish this year.</p>\n<p>“[The EVPSA is] one of the most productive A.S. exec offices and I am going to miss being able to work with such down-to-earth people in the ‘real world,’” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara and Hsu partnered together to work on projects including the establishment of permIGNITE, an organization on campus that works to “empower the marginalized voices that proudly exist within the UC campuses and beyond,” according to the EVPSA’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the biggest challenge that both she and her team faced over the year was time.</p>\n<p>“Everyone else works on this regular calendar year January through December, but student leaders work May to May which is odd,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hsu said the unusual time differences were difficult because students live such different lives than regular government officials.</p>\n<p>Hsu’s elected successor was fourth-year global and Chicanx studies double major Mayela Morales, who was later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified from her position</a> by A.S. Elections Board on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>As she transitions out of her position, Hsu wants the student body to know about all the hard work that both she and the rest of A.S. do throughout the year.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is really a space for students to be their own advocates and … to feel empowered on the issues that they care about,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/","id":2268,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2267,2266,2265],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"C.A.P.S.

This allows for flexibility among both students and staff schedules, according to Honegger.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain free counseling for students, long-term counseling is not offered at UCSB, according to Honegger. Students who desire long-term counseling are typically referred to clinicians within the community that can provide more in-depth support.</p>\n<p>“Some students who have a greater need [for more frequent counseling] are seen for longer; it depends on their financial resources and their level of need and what other alternative services are available out there,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>“Some universities like Stanford … offer long term therapy. [However] the moment you want longer term services, you [are] converted to utilizing your insurance,” he added.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. currently has one psychologist for every 967 students and is aiming to expand to have one psychologist for every 750 students, according to Honegger.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.’ desire] is to hire more clinicians and hopefully with that we’ll be able to serve more people and more efficiently serve them,” he said.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.] believes very strongly that mental health resources should be available to all students … [because of this] it’s hard to have long term therapy options,” he said.</p>\n<p>A future in which long-term counseling is offered at UCSB is a possibility, Honegger said. However, that would require C.A.P.S. to have a “bigger budget, a bigger building, and … more clinicians.”</p>\n<p>Honneger said he believes most students are satisfied with the current short-term model C.A.P.S. follows.</p>\n<p>“For the most part, students just want help getting through a rough time and don’t necessarily want the norm to be long term, extensive, and in-depth therapy,” he said.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. concentrates on assisting students seeking help from professionals in building self-confidence, reducing stress and solving problems among other things, according to <a href=\"http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu\">C.A.P.S.’ website</a>.</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S.] serves a pretty large percent of the student body,” Honegger said.</p>\n<p>In the future, C.A.P.S. hopes to hire a social worker or a family therapist to do initial assessments of the students prior to providing counseling or psychological services.</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. is open Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Thursdays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Students can also contact the office directly at (805) 893-4411.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83017\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/c-a-p-s-director-explains-lack-of-long-term-counseling/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83017\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/c-a-p-s-director-explains-lack-of-long-term-counseling/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/c-a-p-s-director-explains-lack-of-long-term-counseling/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/c-a-p-s-director-explains-lack-of-long-term-counseling/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/c-a-p-s-director-explains-lack-of-long-term-counseling/","id":2266,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2265,2264,2263],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Organizers Move to Pass Prop 68, Which Would Fund I.V.

It is a right, along with … clean air, clean water, and protection from climate impacts,” Creasman said in a press release.</p>\n<p>The legislation will be used to combat the negative effects of California’s natural disasters including the Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara County last December and aid in relief for the Montecito floods, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>A large portion of the bond would fund the implementation of parks in disadvantaged neighborhoods as well as improve the facilities in existing parks, including those in I.V., according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is the lowest income area in the entire county. That sets us up to have priority access to have a lot of the grants that are going to be made available if this bond passes,” Lebell said.</p>\n<p>I.V. would be eligible to receive one or more grants that could total up to $200,000 for park improvements. If the proposition is passed, this money could become available close to the end of the year, according to Lebell.</p>\n<p>This bond would help California’s economy by increasing job opportunities within national park service in fields including environmental planning, construction and tourism, according to Katalina Vang, California Public Interest Research Group’s (CALPIRG) outreach coordinator at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>CALPIRG is a student-run environmental and political organization on campus at UC Santa Barbara that is advocating for Prop 68 to garner voter support.</p>\n<p>“Prop 68 is actually addressing global warming issues straightforwardly instead of abstractly and we finally are receiving solutions from government officials on how to solve these environmental issues,” Vang said in an email.</p>\n<p>The proposition’s passage would allow for future generations to better conserve the natural resources and guarantee a world that has usable resources, according to Vang.</p>\n<p>“We need to ensure we build a foundation of saving our environment before it gets worse,” she said.</p>\n<p>Despite the number of political leaders and organizations that are in support of the proposition, several public figures openly oppose proposition 68 including Senator John Moorlach, Andrea Seastrand, President of the Central Coast Taxpayers Association and Jon Coupal, President of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.</p>\n<p>Moorlach argued that the bond will do more harm than good because the government would need to raise taxes in order to pay off the money that would need to be borrowed for the measure.</p>\n<p>In an article written by Coupal, he refers to the Legislative Analyst Office report on Prop 68 that estimates that it will take $7.8 billion to pay off the bond: $4 billion in principal spending and $3.8 billion in interest rates.</p>\n<p>“It will take approximately $8 billion to pay off the $4 billion of borrowed funds. That means you can expect a tax increase. And your children can expect a tax increase. And your grandchildren can expect a tax increase,” Moorlach said in a press release.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

in which survivors of sexual violence can begin to heal,” according to the organization’s website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization’s main goal is to raise awareness for sexual assault through “activism, advocacy, and survivor empowerment,” said Emily Umana, TBTN’s finance coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planned Parenthood, Counseling and Psychological Services and the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center set up booths during the rally to give out buttons, coloring books and further information on their respective organizations, offering help to anyone who has experienced sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaker Kat Alexander, founder and chief executive officer of “Report It Girl,” a web platform aiming to give survivors of sexual assault a platform to speak out, recounted her personal experiences to the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She described how being a survivor of both rape and incest impacted her life and urged the men and women at the event to be honest with themselves about the tragedies they have endured.</span></p>\n<div

said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander spoke about the need for survivors of sexual assault to speak up about what has happened to them and about how surrounding oneself with a community of people is crucial. She explained that approaching traumatic experiences head-on instead of pushing them away is important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to know that there was at least one person out there who had even remotely gone through what I had been through,” she said. “Grief is a totally appropriate response if you have experienced trauma.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander asked the students listening to get into groups with their friends and share ways in which they were going to decide to address the negative emotions that arise within their own lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I come from an area where [sexual assault] wasn’t talked about,” said Linnea Loeb, second-year biology major. “It’s important to have a presence so people know not only that they’re not alone, but that they have allies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really cool to have an organization focused on women empowerment and women acting for women,” said Layla Hernandez, a second-year English major who attended the rally.</span></p>\n<p>In an email this Saturday, Jane Diep, TBTN co-chair, said the organization prefers to emphasize intersectionality and makes efforts to be inclusive of all sexual assault and interpersonal violence, not just women, because “people of all genders experience [sexual assault].”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization hung teal and purple bandanas around UCSB’s campus for sexual assault awareness month and in preparation for the event, according to Umana.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want this rally to increase awareness and participation to combat rape culture and interpersonal violence. We hope to have individuals inspired and understand what they are fighting for,” Umana said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to their annual spring rally, TBTN meets weekly to discuss how they can combat rape culture and make UCSB and I.V. safer for women.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article previously referred to Loeb as a TBTN member. Diep, a TBTN co-chair, has informed the Nexus that the organization’s executive board does not recognize Loeb as a member. This article now uses “survivor” to refer to people who have been sexually assaulted, where before it used “victim.”</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Senate Bill 320, which is scheduled to go to a vote in the State Assembly this year, will determine whether Mifeprex will be required at all California public university Student Health centers, including UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to review the FDA’s report in response to concerns raised to Congress about the safety of the drug in light of the 2016 changes, according to Marcia Crosse, a director in the GAO’s Health Care Team.</p>\n<p>The GAO is a department of the U.S. Congress that oversees decisions made by the executive branch, which includes the FDA, Crosse explained.</p>\n<p>The GAO began their research of the report in April of 2017.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> previously reported that <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/abortion-pills-may-be-available-to-california-college-students-with-passage-of-bill/\">the bill was approved</a> by the California Senate in January. If the bill is approved by the Assembly and signed by Governor Jerry Brown, all California public universities will offer the pills by Jan. 1, 2022.</p>\n<p>Support for this bill comes largely from the Women’s Foundation and the Tara Health Foundation that, along with other anonymous backers, are fully funding the implementation of SB 320 into public universities, according to a press release by the Tara Health Foundation and the Women’s Foundation.</p>\n<p>“Once a student has decided to end a pregnancy, they shouldn’t be forced to go off campus to see a provider they don’t know,” Surina Khan, CEO of the Women’s Foundation of California, said in a press release.</p>\n<p>The National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a non-partisan council, also released a report on March 16 that confirmed that the Mifeprex pill is safe and effective.</p>\n<p>In a study published by NASEM, 96.7 percent of abortions performed by Mifeprex before 63 days of gestation were effective, and 93.1 percent of abortions performed between 64 to 70 days after gestation were effective.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82245\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Abortion-Pill-Graphic.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1878116968\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82234\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82245\" data-attachment-id=\"82245\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/abortion-pill-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Abortion-Pill-Graphic.jpg?fit=2315%2C1036&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2315,1036\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Abortion Pill Graphic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Abortion-Pill-Graphic.jpg?fit=250%2C112&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Abortion-Pill-Graphic.jpg?fit=888%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-82245\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Abortion-Pill-Graphic-1024x458.jpg?resize=888%2C397\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Abortion-Pill-Graphic.jpg?resize=1024%2C458&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Abortion-Pill-Graphic.jpg?resize=250%2C112&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Abortion-Pill-Graphic.jpg?resize=768%2C344&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Abortion-Pill-Graphic.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82245\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Stephany Rubio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“[The study] confirms what research has shown for decades—that medication abortion can be safely and effectively provided in a variety of settings,” said Senator Connie Leyva, the author of SB-320. “I urge my colleagues in the Assembly to consider these findings and swiftly pass SB 320.”</p>\n<p>These changes, which were implemented in 2016, include a change in the dosing regimen from 600 mg, approved in 2000, to 200 mg. The gestational time limit changed from 49 days to 70 days, according to the report by the FDA that was published on March 29, 2016.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the new label, the drug can also be administered by a health care provider rather than a physician, which the old label required. Post-treatment includes an assessment of the patient 7-14 days after the drug is taken, rather than a formal examination conducted by a physician, according to an article published by the <a href=\"http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/sally-rafie-pharmd/2016/04/abortion-pill-label-change-what-pharmacists-need-to-know\">Pharmacy Times.</a></p>\n<p>The waiting period to take Misoprostol, the medication taken after Mireprex, changed from 72 hours to 24-48 hours. The dosage of Misoprostol was also changed from 2 tablets (400 mcg) to 4 tablets (800 mcg).</p>\n<p>“[People] argued that the FDA were missing instances [in their review of the drug] where patients might have died because they were not using one of the [proper] monitoring systems that monitor the safety of drugs,” Crosse said.</p>\n<p>The Sentinel System is the monitoring system used by the FDA to determine the safety of medicine by analyzing health information made available by physicians online, according to the FDA website.</p>\n<p>After an investigation of the FDA’s approval of changes, the GAO found that the attacks by the critics against the proper use of the Sentinel System were invalid because the Sentinel System applies only to drugs distributed through pharmacies.</p>\n<p>“MifePrex is not distributed through pharmacies so information on it would not be available in the Sentinel System to allow it to track safety concerns,” Crosse said.</p>\n<p>Mifeprex does have another mechanism to track its safety concerns, and Crosse confirmed that Mifeprex has a low rate of serious medical events that occurred as a result of women taking the drug.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An original version of this article stated that SB 320 will allow all public universities to provide the abortion pill.

id=\"caption-attachment-82091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Coalition for a Better UC presented to A.S. their campaign to extend Cal Grant aid to summer sessions, claiming it is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school. <em>Will Tran /Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition for a Better UC launched a campaign in the fall of 2017 focused on passing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assembly Bill 3153</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which will extend financial aid from Cal Grant into summer sessions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign is expected to end in June of 2018 when the State Assembly will vote on the bill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coalition is requesting that the funding for this aid increase come from Governor Jerry Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s fund, which will amount to  $13.5 billion by the summer of 2019 avoids raising taxes for the extended aid, according to Eddy Chikukwa the president and founder of the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California’s Office of the President (UCOP) estimated the total cost of summer tuition for all the UCs, Cal States and community colleges would be $148 million a year, which is 1 percent of Brown’s Rainy Day Fund.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa, a third-year political science and philosophy double major, said he was inspired to start this campaign when he began working for the UC Santa Barbara Office of Financial Aid earlier last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Directors for the Cal State campuses are meeting in April to discuss and potentially approve the Bill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The board] saying they’ll legitimize it, means 23 Cal States and the 450,000 students they represent said they’re [in support of] this. It’s a really big deal for negotiating leverage with legislators,” Chikukwa said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chikukwa, the coalition organizers alongside the University of California Student Association (UCSA) and the UC Regents will be going to Sacramento from March 24 to March 26 to present the bill to state legislators and ask for support. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Associated Students (A.S.) passed a resolution on March 7 supporting this campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was presented by Mayela Morales, legislative outreach director for the Coalition, and Justice Dumlao, a third-year global studies major and communication director for the Coalition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Irvine’s A.S. passed their own resolution on Feb. 15 sponsoring the Coalition’s campaign, and UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC Merced are among others that are discussing their involvement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most telling signs that someone is going to graduate [in four years] is income level,” Director of Student Outreach for the Coalition, Chadwyck Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a study done by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) in 2015, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California will see a decrease of 1.1 million college graduates by 2030 due to lack of financial aid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chikukwa and the rest of the Coalition began promoting the idea of extending the Cal Grant into summer sessions in order to increase the amount of students that graduate out of UC’s and Cal States within four years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The Coalition’s] whole motive was to educate people first, and then build legislative support,” said Chikukwa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the bill more appealing to legislators, the Coalition is asking students to sign a petition in support of it, according to Moore,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a fourth-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to show [the legislators] that students are behind this and are watching every step of the way,” Chikukwa said.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cal Grant is expected to include undocumented students as well as offer more financial aid to students from middle income families, added Chikukwa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Coalition’s platform that was presented to the A.S. claims that the campaign is a small step in the efforts to keep students from marginalized backgrounds in school and to “ultimately create free higher education institutions</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We students need to take this matter into our own hands. Taking out loans.. only increases the over $1.3 trillion of student debt nationwide,” said Morales, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fourth-year global and chicanx studies double major</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “I’m very optimistic that this bill will be approved.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article inaccurately reported that the funding will be officially coming from Governor Brown’s “Rainy Day Fund,” and has been corrected to show that the Coalition for a Better UC is recommending it come from Brown’s Fund</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/students-fight-for-bill-to-extend-cal-grant-into-summer/","id":2308,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[2307,2306,2305],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Light Fixtures To Be Installed in I.V.

Community Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anisq’Oyo’ Park, Children’s Park and Estero Park are among other proposed locations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould explained that electrical boxes have already been installed in the ground at People’s Park by Embarcadero Hall and I.V. Clinic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underground trenches to power two electrical panels have also been constructed that run from two cement access points in the ground.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gould, the electrical panels are scheduled to be installed in April and will allow bands to come and perform at People’s Park without needing to bring in a generator for power.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The electrical lines installed will also help bring light to Perfect Park, which is located next to People’s Park, Gould added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funding for these new improvements will be coming from Measure O that was on the ballot last May for I.V. voters for the 2017 Santa Barbara County Elections. Lebell said the measure was a response to the expiration of a “consolidated bond” established in 1999 that taxed each bedroom in I.V. an extra $28 a year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the bond was paid off, instead of allowing this tax to expire, the IVRPD held a special election in June of 2017 that proposed keeping the tax at the same rate for an additional 10 years, but this time to have the money go toward park improvements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measure O gives the IVRPD about $250,000 a year to apply towards park enhancements, Lebell said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD is also hoping to install new lighting on the basketball courts at Estero Park, located off of Camino Del Sur. This would “allow community members to play after sunset,” IVRDP Chairman Jacob Lebell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell said the new lighting proposals are “a response to the community’s desire for improvements.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the years, improved lighting has consistently ranked among Isla Vistan’s infrastructural issues that they would most like to see addressed and improved,” Lebell said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this time, no concrete decisions have been made for expanding lighting, other than what has already been installed in People’s Park.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82051\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a

it was changed for the preservation of local wildlife. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD Board convened on Feb. 22 to address comments and concerns from the staff about said dog park and to finalize a location, according to the IVRPD Special Meeting Agenda. The project is proposed to begin in Spring Quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Board member Pegeen Soutar, the original proposed location for the park was Anisq’Oyo’ Park, next to I.V. Drip. However there were concerns that the presence of dogs could potentially disrupt the park’s pond and the birds that reside there. Because of this, they decided to move the park to Seuno. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soutar, who was accompanied by her own dog, Honeybear, revealed that both she and Jacob Lebell, the Chairman of the IVRPD board, are leading the project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell referred to the park on Sueno as a “fairly nice park, but very underutilized.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the park consists of a big grass field with a children’s play structure and a couple of picnic tables. The IVRPD is currently considering the possibility of transferring the play structure to Children’s Park once the dog park is established, Lebell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renovations to the park will be made, including surrounding the perimeter with a fence and possibly a “double-gate” to make it easy for dogs to get in and out. Lebell also expressed the IVRPD’s desire to eventually expand the area out in front of the park to include “more and nicer picnic tables.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to convert one of the parks to a dog park was proposed by Lebell after he took notice of the increased amount of dogs in Isla Vista since students have begun to be allowed to have emotional support animals. He also realized that a number of I.V. residences do not have yards that are equipped for dogs to run in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD has also discussed the possibility of including a drinking fountain for the dogs and structures like a hollowed log for the dogs to play on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lebell’s vision of the park would eventually include a reduced cost or free dog training classes there in an attempt to create a place where “there could be a more centrally located place for dog information.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board will be reaching out to the houses in the neighboring vicinity once the project is underway to let them know the changes that will be occuring. The park would have a curfew, like most dog parks, to ensure that people and their dogs do not utilize it past daytime hours. However, a specific time has not yet been decided on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board currently does not have a definitive timeline for the finalized project. Lebell said the plan may be minorly delayed, depending on how impacted local construction companies are by the recent fires and flooding in the Montecito area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lebell, the park’s main purpose would be to create a place where dog owners could organize together and let their dogs run around freely and socialize.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81742\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81742\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ivrpd-to-establish-community-dog-park/","id":4329,"author":{"id":88,"name":"Katie Wolf"},"related":[4328,4327,4326],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/88"}},"__N_SSG":true}
