LBSU jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead after its first two turns at bat, but the Gauchos were able to equalize in the bottom of the second after sophomore outfielder Amanda Ziegler launched a two-run bomb to left with one out. It was the younger of the Ziegler sisters’ first home run and RBI of the year after she posted four homers and 28 RBI during her freshman campaign.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[The Ziegler home run] was awesome,” Beristianos said. “It’s always great to see an underclassman come through in situations like that. I was very happy for her.”<br>\nBoth sides went scoreless through the third, fourth and half of the fifth until UCSB broke the game wide open in the fifth’s later half. With two on and two out, freshman infielder Keilani</p>\n<p>Jennings lifted a three-run shot to right — her fourth of the year — to put Santa Barbara up 5-2. No runs would be scored for the game’s remainder, leaving the Gauchos with a win which was not only their second win in 18 games, but the first time they had put up five runs or more since March 26. Cobb was credited with the win after giving up only two runs on seven hits while fanning five.</p>\n<p>“We just did the little things,” Beristianos said. “We got runners on base, moved runners and got bunts down. We put the ball in play and made the defense play.”</p>\n<p>The second game featured a pitcher’s duel between Cobb and fellow sophomore ace Taylor Petty, with no runs being scored outside of the third inning. In that deciding frame, it was Cobb who blinked first, hitting the first batter she faced which eventually led to that runner scoring on a single by senior outfielder Ashley Weber. Cobb allowed no more Long Beach runs for the game after that. UCSB answered its next turn at bat with two consecutive RBI singles from senior infielder Jessica Ziegler and sophomore outfielder Brooke Putich, putting UCSB up 2-1. Petty left the game in the fourth in favor of junior Brooke Turner, who proceeded to leave the Gauchos hitless for the rest of the game. Cobb was equal to the task, and earned her fifth win of the year after giving up only one run on seven hits.</p>\n<p>Despite having its first conference series victory of the year assured, UCSB again placed Cobb on the mound to face Turner after the Gaucho sophomore had already pitched 14 innings the day before. In a pitcher’s duel worthy of remembrance, Cobb and Turner continued to trade scoreless innings until the end of regulation and still the scoreboard read 0-0. Having now pitched 21 consecutive innings, conventional wisdom would dictate pulling Cobb in favor of either senior MeLinda Matsumoto or Lindsey Correa, but the team stood by their ace and in return, their ace did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>“We definitely wanted to keep her in,” Beristianos said. “She was keeping [Long Beach] off-guard, doing so well out there we just wanted to stay until she ran out of gas.”</p>\n<p>Cobb pitched two more scoreless innings until finally in the bottom of the tenth, the Santa Barbara offense broke though Turner. Sophomore outfielder Jamie Adishian began the inning with a single, then advanced to second on a sacrifice by Jessica Ziegler. Putich grounded one straight to the pitcher in the next at bat, but reached first safely as Turner tried unsuccessfully to throw out Adishian running to third. With runners on the corners and one out, all UCSB needed was a deep sacrifice to win, and Beristianos obliged them. Beristianos sent one high to center field for the sacrifice RBI, which scored Adishian from third and completed the Gauchos’ first sweep of Long Beach since 2001. For her part, Cobb earned her third win in a row, equaling the number of wins this weekend that she had in her previous 15 starts, while holding LBSU scoreless on six hits Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We had fought and fought and fought, and we just hadn’t gotten our breaks, so we were ready to battle and keep on fighting,” Beristianos said. “To get the results that we did [this weekend] was awesome.”</p>\n<p>UCSB completes its 2010 home schedule next weekend when it hosts a three-game set with Pacific, with games on Saturday and Sunday at noon, 2 p.m. and noon respectively. As always, admission for students is free.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21620\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21620\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-02/sb-strikes-gold-49ers/","id":147,"author":{"id":302,"name":"Miles Yim"},"related":[146,145,144],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Softball Hosts Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After suffering its third series sweep at the hands of a Big West opponent, the UCSB softball team returns home to Campus Diamond this weekend to entertain Long Beach State in a three-game set.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After suffering its third series sweep at the hands of a Big West opponent, the UCSB softball team returns home to Campus Diamond this weekend to entertain Long Beach State in a three-game set.

The 49ers have only earned one series win in conference this season (a road series against Northridge), and recently dropped two of three against Cal Poly. Sophomore ace Taylor Petty’s team-best ERA of 2.50 is one of only three in the Big West under 3.00, and her 119 strikeouts are a league best. With a record of 9-12, Petty (who competed regularly against Gaucho sophomore pitcher Krista Cobb in high school) has kept Long Beach in games despite defending an offense that only averages just over three runs per game. As for that 49er offense, freshman infielder Nalani St. Germain leads her team with 25 RBI and a .274 average with an impressive eight home runs.</p>\n<p>As for the Gauchos, UCSB saw its 13-game losing streak snap against the Highlanders two weekends ago — only to see that momentum snapped by a Northridge series that saw them lose on walk-offs twice. Despite the disappointing results, Santa Barbara did see its pitching staff perform better, posting a 2.90 ERA over the series.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Regardless of recent events, the Gauchos will need to continue that excellence if they are to stay competitive with Long Beach.

Cal State Fullerton is the only Big West team with worse numbers in those categories, and the Titans swept Santa Barbara (in a series that included two mercy-rule victories) to open Big West play.

Then in the two games she pitched against CSUN, she allowed only seven runs on 12 hits. It remains to be seen if seniors Lindsey Correa and MeLinda Matsumoto — whose ERAs are both around 4.60 — can improve along with the sophomore.</p>\n<p>Key to improving the pitching staff will be the Gaucho’s offense, which has been anemic at best. UCSB has been outscored 242-101 this year and displays only three hitters with averages above .240. Best among those three has been senior infielder Jessica Zeigler who, with her .324 average, leads the team with 47 hits in 145 at-bats. Junior infielder Jessica Beristianos leads the team with 14 RBI, and sophomore outfielder Brooke Putich, who is tied for second on the team with hits and runs with 31 and 15 respectively, has shown flashes of greatness at times.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins the weekend against Long Beach with a doubleheader that starts Saturday at noon. The teams will conclude their series with another noon game on Sunday. UCSB will then stay at home for a three-game hosting of Pacific. As always, admission is free for students.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-21555\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-30/21555/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-21555\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-30/21555/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-30/21555/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-30/21555/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-04-30/21555/","id":179,"author":{"id":302,"name":"Miles Yim"},"related":[178,177,176],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/302"}},"__N_SSG":true}
