With people staggered from wall to wall without an inch of space left, all eyes were fixated on the figure that stood before us. A flickering hue of purple shined onstage, outlining a crooked snapback and slim physique. With the music slowly rising in volume and the audience bustling with an intense roar of excitement, the artist grabbed the mic and declared “I go by the name of RL Grime. Santa Barbara let me see those hands!” The bass dropped.</p>\n<p>24-year-old Henry Steinway, otherwise known by his stage name, RL Grime, is a popular electronic artist and producer from Los Angeles, CA. Famous for his addictive mixture of both electronic dance music and hip hop-sampled trap, RL Grime is a favored artist in the EDM-infatuated culture of our generation. So it’s no surprise that the entirety of his nationwide Void Tour, which kicked off in October, has been a major success. Santa Barbara welcomed him with open arms this past Thursday, Feb. 5.</p>\n<p>RL Grime is part of WeDidIt Collective, which includes artists such as Shlohmo and Ryan Hemsworth. His entrancing original tunes and stimulating remixes have gotten millions of plays on SoundCloud. The list includes originals such as “Tell Me” and “Core” and remixes of Big Sean’s “Kingpin” and Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa.” His 2008 EP <em>High Beams</em> debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Electronic chart and at No. 8 on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Albums chart. <em>Void</em>, his 2014 debut studio album, is just another step towards the artist’s growing world of electronic possibilities. It seems that no matter how the L.A. native chooses to demonstrate his musical talents, his devoted fan base continues to expand.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Presented by REDEYE and EPIC events, Velvet Jones became the destination for hundreds of EDM lovers. Tommy Kruise and Lunice warmed up the venue with their refreshing hip hop remixes, pumping up everyone for the sold-out night. When RL Grime finally hit the stage, college students who were otherwise stressed with papers and midterms filled with nothing but happiness and enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>The young artist remained stationed behind his elevated podium, giving off a mysterious vibe throughout the set. The lighting primarily came from behind, casting a dark shadow over him to set off the vibrant shades of red, green and purple. In rare moments, a light shined directly onto RL Grime, exposing his zealous expression and intriguing appearance. In front of his wide podium was the shape of a gravestone — the iconic symbol of the WeDidIt collective.</p>\n<p>“Scylla,” a <em>Void </em>favorite, opened the set. Instead of easing the crowd into some of his more regularly rhythm beats, RL Grime jumped right into the good stuff — the type of “good stuff” that everyone came to see him for. “Scylla” was perfect for this, stunning the audience with enrapturing beats and base drops that cast a rebellious spell over everyone. Its lower-toned attributes and fast-paced theme created a turbulent atmosphere which translated into a vicious monster-fighting scene in a film. Velvet Jones exploded with pandemonium.</p>\n<p>RL Grime continued to bless the crowd with mind-blowing bass drops, hip hop snippets and trap vibrations. Songs such as “Core” and “Heard Me” set the venue on fire. People began crowd-surfing and standing on the ledges along the edges of Velvet Jones, and the intensity of the bass shaking the walls increased everyone’s fervor. Remixes of Beyonce’s “711,” YG’s “My Ni**a,” Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa” and TNGHT’s “Acrylics” created extreme devoutness to the music. RL Grime truly has a way of making an audience feel invincible.</p>\n<p>With a set that lasted over an hour and a half, RL Grime did not let his devotees down for a single second. Towards the end, he came out from behind his podium and made his way to the front of the stage, announcing that he had one more song in store before the end of the night. As he made his way back behind the podium, the beginning of “Tell Me” started playing and everyone knew that the best part of the night was about to happen. As the music built up and the bass was about to drop, RL Grime counted down from three and Velvet Jones erupted one last time. He added in an interesting remix of the tune before once again playing the beloved and well-known drop for which the L.A. native is known. As I headed home, the strong melody still rang in my ears.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60640\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60640\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-08/rl-grime-creates-turbulence-at-sold-out-velvet-jones-show/","id":7005,"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto"},"related":[7004,7003,7002],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Three Albums To Listen to on a Rainy Day","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With a heavy downpour of rain hitting Santa Barbara this past week, many of you (like myself) may have understood the bad weather as the perfect opportunity to skip class and stay inside.

While most people enjoyed their self-made days off by snuggling up and watching Netflix, others did not have this luxury. Nope — some of you brave ones actually sacrificed dry clothes to attend class. For those of you who were unable to participate in this clichéd rainy-day-Netflix-binge, there is a remedy. I present you with a list of three albums that make up the perfect soundtrack for your rainy day adventures. Whether you are biking to class or running from place to place trying to stay dry, these albums are guaranteed to enhance the bittersweet sensation that comes with a typical rainy day.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Grace</em> — Jeff Buckley</li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_59112\" style=\"width: 211px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4458_2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2050069363\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59111\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59112\" data-attachment-id=\"59112\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/three-albums-to-listen-to-on-a-rainy-day/4458_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4458_2.jpg?fit=807%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"807,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4458_2.jpg?fit=202%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4458_2.jpg?fit=807%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59112 size-medium\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4458_2-201x250.jpg?resize=201%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of rockpaperphoto.com\" width=\"201\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-59112\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>rockpaperphoto.com</em></p></div>\n<p>I cannot count how many times I’ve listened to this album on a gloomy day. Whether you are familiar with Jeff Buckley or not, there is one important thing you must know about his work: It never ceases to reach within the unexplored depths of your heart.</p>\n<p>Every time you give this album a listen, you will realize that it will affect you in a different way. While one instance may cause you to remember a bad episode of heartbreak, another will make you completely reevaluate your perception on life.

Other songs, such as “Hallelujah” (yes, you know which song I’m talking about) and “Lilac Wine,” achieve this effect in a similar way — exploring the dark side of love while also carrying a unique sense of optimism.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><em>The Queen is Dead</em> — The Smiths</li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_59113\" style=\"width: 175px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MI0001370134.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2124915161\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59111\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59113\" data-attachment-id=\"59113\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/three-albums-to-listen-to-on-a-rainy-day/mi0001370134/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MI0001370134.jpg?fit=264%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"264,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MI0001370134.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MI0001370134.jpg?fit=264%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59113 size-medium\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MI0001370134-165x250.jpg?resize=165%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of allmusic.com\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MI0001370134.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MI0001370134.jpg?w=264&amp;ssl=1 264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 165px) 100vw, 165px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-59113\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>allmusic.com</em></p></div>\n<p>You can never go wrong with the Smiths. The sound of Steven Morrissey’s soothing English accent as well as the band’s mellow instrumentals are simply addictive. Their sound is filled with melancholy, addressing themes of love and heartbreak that go nicely with a lonely stride in the rain. The Smiths have a way of making me either happy or sad, and perhaps that’s why I keep listening to them — I can never truly decide. They have this compelling way of making me want to confess my love to someone while also making me cautious of the potential pain that could follow.</p>\n<p>The best, and undeniably most popular, song on the album is “There is a Light That Never Goes Out.” I remember the first time I listened to this tune, and I will never forget the way the chorus resonated with me: “To die by your side / is such a heavenly way to die.” It’s like a double-whammy, piecing together both death and love in the same sentence. For this very reason, The Smiths go hand-in-hand with gloomy weather.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><em>In Between Dreams</em> — Jack Johnson</li>\n</ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_59116\" style=\"width: 176px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/jack-johnson.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"550918771\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59111\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59116\" data-attachment-id=\"59116\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-07/three-albums-to-listen-to-on-a-rainy-day/musician-jack-johnson-performs-during-his-concert-as-part-of-his-to-the-sea-tour-in-brasilia/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/jack-johnson.jpg?fit=2333%2C3500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2333,3500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"REUTERS\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Musician Jack Johnson performs during his concert as part of his To The Sea tour in Brasilia May 25, 2011.

Unlike Jeff Buckley or The Smiths, Jack Johnson has the magical ability to turn a rough day into a happy one. One thing that has always drawn me to Jack Johnson is his flavorful use of optimism in both his lyrics and his sound. His songs are refreshing, gratifying and hopeful — an instant mood-changer.</p>\n<p>A little bit of Jack Johnson is exactly what a rainy day needs: that extra sense of happiness and comfort. “Banana Pancakes” especially adds to that needed good-feel vibe. Starting off with the sound of the rain, this song is undeniably meant to be listened to on a rainy day. So, if you need that extra push to make it through those unwanted showers, Mr. Johnson is your guy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

wish you were here.” These are the legendary lyrics we have become familiar with over the course of our lives. If your childhood was anything like mine, you also have nostalgic memories of growing up to the sweet and powerful tunes of English psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd. Even if you didn’t consciously listen to Pink Floyd, you’d probably recognize the striking sounds of the band’s most popular songs, such as “Wish You Were Here,” “Comfortably Numb” and “Another Brick in the Wall, pt. 2.” After nearly 20 years of silence, the group released its final album on Nov. 7.</p>\n<p><em>The Endless River</em> isn’t necessarily an album of new, original and never-before-heard songs. Instead, the music comes from the 1993 Division Bell sessions, in which David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason (three of the five original band members, the others being Roger Waters and Syd Barrett) played casually together at Britannia Row Studios in London and the Astoria houseboat recording studio moored along the River Thames. The tracks that were created through this collaborative effort are the basis that forms the band’s final album.</p>\n<p>Although noticeably comparable to Pink Floyd’s ethereal space sound, the tracks that make up <em>The Endless River</em> are unlike any of their renowned songs. Instead, the album is composed of all instrumental songs with the exception of “Louder than Words.” Gilmour’s wife Polly Samson wrote the lyrics for this last track.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Each part makes up a track on the CD, adding up to a total of 18 tracks. “Louder Than Words” came out the as the only single off the album during the beginning of October. Because of Wright’s death in 2008, the album serves as final means of showcasing the musical talent and creativity of Pink Floyd’s three lasting members.</p>\n<p>Although it has been critiqued for not being an actual “album,” and rather a re-publishing of songs already in existence, I think <em>The Endless River</em> is an admirable collection of music that gives Pink Floyd lovers a taste of the band’s illustrious instrumentals, one last time. The music flows beautifully from part to part, and moves me in a way that only Pink Floyd seems to be capable of doing. For instance, “It’s What We Do” (Side 1, Pt. 2) is composed of calming and sensational drum and keyboard rhythms that are downplayed by high-pitched guitar solos. The sounds are built up towards the end of the track, and transition into the next piece entitled “Ebb and Flow” (Side 1, Pt. 3). The rhythm and sound remains continuous as the former track ends and the latter track begins. Only several seconds into “Ebb and Flow” does the rhythm from “It’s What We Do” fade away.</p>\n<p>It is eclectic, combing the sonic experimentation techniques of the guitar, keyboard and drums to create powerful rhythms and harmonies. While soothing and slowly-paced tunes incline me to close my eyes and relax, electric and upbeat qualities make me want to get up and run marathon. It is these factors that remind me why Pink Floyd’s inspirational tunes have transformed audiences across generations.</p>\n<p>Although “Louder Than Words” complements the closing of the album nicely, it is not one of my favorite tracks, as the lyrics minimize the potential of the song. With lyrics including “We bitch and we fight/diss at each other on sight” and the chorus comprising of “The sum of our hearts/the beat of our parts/is louder than words,” I think the song would have been more exceptional without vocals. I feel like these lyrics are a little bit pretentious and do little to compel the listener — the opposite for which Pink Floyd has always been praised. Therefore, I prefer to focus on the compelling instrumentals that I have grown to adore Pink Floyd for over the course of my lifetime.</p>\n<p>My favorite track is “Anisina” (Side 2, Pt. 4) because it is one of the most melodic pieces on the album. Instead of including random keyboard sounds and abstract guitar riffs, this tune is consistent in its entirety. Although it is instrumental, its persistent drum and piano melodies are catchy. Its instrumentals build up during the middle of the piece and are further dramatized by the dynamic sound of the saxophone. Because it is more formally patterned, its predictability draws me in in a way that no other track does. A compelling guitar solo finishes the song and leaves me feeling both optimistic and powerful.</p>\n<p>Whether you still actively listen to Pink Floyd or are only able to recount a handful of bittersweet,             rock ‘n’ roll-filled memories, <em>The Endless River</em> is a work of art that should be listened to as a tribute to the renowned group of musical geniuses. Although incomparable to the authentic hits and musical brilliance of the group’s previous releases, this final album acts as the cherry on the cake for the entirety of Pink Floyd’s journey as a band.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAGLgnFfZeY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58872\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-27/a-taste-of-the-past-pink-floyds-final-album/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58872\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-27/a-taste-of-the-past-pink-floyds-final-album/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-27/a-taste-of-the-past-pink-floyds-final-album/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-27/a-taste-of-the-past-pink-floyds-final-album/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-27/a-taste-of-the-past-pink-floyds-final-album/","id":7034,"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto"},"related":[7033,7032,7031],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yellow Red Sparks Fly as The Kinds Join In at Muddy Waters","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Making my way past the shelves of knick-knacks and through the powerful aroma of coffee sizzling in the air, I found a cramped spot in the crowded coffee shop to catch two shows — The Kinds and Yell...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Making my way past the shelves of knick-knacks and through the powerful aroma of coffee sizzling in the air, I found a cramped spot in the crowded coffee shop to catch two shows — The Kinds and Yellow Red Sparks. As a first-timer at Muddy Waters Coffee House, which is just a mile away from the bustling excitement of State Street, I immediately felt at home. Its dim lighting, art-filled walls, funky light fixtures and vintage couches gave the venue a cozy and relaxed feel. Enthusiastic members from all over the Santa Barbara and greater SoCal area welcomed the two Cali-based bands to the scene last Friday night, Oct. 17 as a part of the New Noise Conference and Music Festival.</p>\n<p>YELLOW RED SPARKS</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57737\" style=\"width: 355px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"712349381\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57736\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57737\" data-attachment-id=\"57737\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/yellow-red-sparks-1012-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 7D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1337478691\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"17\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57737\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?resize=345%2C230\" alt=\"Courtesy of wptsradio.com\" width=\"345\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yellow-Red-Sparks-1012-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>wptsradio.com</em></p></div>\n<p>The first band, Yellow Red Sparks, is a four-piece collective from Irvine, Calif., composed of Joshua Hanson (vocals/songwriter/guitar), Darren “Goldy” Goldstein (drums), Sarah Lynn Nishikawa (bass) and Mike Harris (keyboard).

This tune quickly drew in a crowd to the main area of the coffee shop, with attendees bopping their heads and swaying their bodies to the rhythm. Slowing down the mood of the locale, their second song “Buy Me Honey” revealed a more melodramatic theme. They continued to play songs off their self-titled album, including the popular “Scents and Sensibility” and “Monsters with Misdemeanors,” as well as new songs not yet released.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite parts of the show was their rendition of Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” Hanson asked the audience to sing along to “help break some ice,” which ended up bringing the crowd even closer together. The combination of Hanson’s dulcet voice with the melodic group vocals of the audience created a beautiful and dreamlike atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The band’s cinematic/indie folk tunes and sentimental melodies fused together to produce uplifting and heartfelt anthems. Their fun stage presence also added to the intimacy of the set, making me feel lucky that I was able to be a part of something so inimitable. Closing out with a song titled “Seven Seas,” which the group announced will be coming out next month, the Yellow Red Sparks left a positive vibe behind in Muddy Waters.</p>\n<p>After their set, I caught up with them on the sidewalk outside of the venue. When I asked how Yellow Red Sparks came to be, they had an interesting story to tell. “Basically, I was just doing coffee shop stuff and Goldy took some of my songs and added drums to it,” Hanson explained. From there, Goldy introduced Hanson to Nishikawa, an upright bass player who Goldy was teaching drums to at the time. The trio formed a band, and later added the fourth member, Mike, who the group affectionately calls the “newbie.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the significance of their band name, Hanson laid out the dynamics for me. “The band name initially comes from our song entitled ‘Yellow Red Sparks,’ which is also a part of our self-titled album. To me, the phrase means passion, with the mellow color of yellow colliding with the vibrant color of red.”</p>\n<p>Adding to this comment, Goldy mentioned that “the term mirrors the emotional push-and-pull that comes with relationships — both the loving and the heated parts.” These opposite emotions, which we all can identify with, were felt through the set as their songs encompassed expressions of both joy and melancholy as a way to meticulously depict all realities of what it means to be human. I could sense this up-and-down pattern as the band moved from song to song, feeling hopeful through one moment and feeling somber through the other.</p>\n<p>These ideas tie in with the main themes of the band’s lyrics. “Our songs are about human stuff,” said Hanson in a whimsical manner. “They’re all about struggling with relationships and the challenge of maintaining faith and hope throughout it all. I like to call it the human struggle.”</p>\n<p>I could tell that Hanson was deep in his thoughts by the way he stared at the concrete beneath him, hands in his pockets. For a second he collected his thoughts, a slight frown on his forehead. Suddenly he looked up and continued, “The goal for us is to affect people with music. We don’t just want it to be something that people bop their heads to, but to be something that makes people feel something.”</p>\n<p>A genuine look on his face, Hanson left me with this message: “We want to connect with people and take that as far as we can, whether that’s to a hundred people or to thousands of people. As cliché as it sounds, we just want to change people’s lives through music.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57739\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1148114756\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57736\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57739\" data-attachment-id=\"57739\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/kinds/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?fit=479%2C319&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"479,319\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kinds\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?fit=479%2C319&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57739\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?resize=356%2C236\" alt=\"Courtesy of independent.com\" width=\"356\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?w=479&amp;ssl=1 479w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kinds.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57739\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>independent.com</em></p></div>\n<p>THE KINDS</p>\n<p>The headlining band, The Kinds, is a local group from Santa Barbara, Calif. Formed by Khasy Modisette (vocals/guitar), Nathan Modisette (bass), Anders Bergstrom (guitar/back-up vocals) and Erich Riedl (drums), the band hit the sweet spot for many locals and non-locals that have been anticipating the performance for months. While the band has played the New Noise Festival before, this was their first time headlining for the event.</p>\n<p>They opened their performance with one of their most popular songs, “Been a Long Time.” This song combined the soothing rhythm of the guitar with the compelling female vocals of the lead singer, which immediately set a warm tone for the show. Elements of indie, folk, rock and country were apparent throughout their songs, fascinating the crowd with irresistible forms of musicianship that nobody could quite walk away from.</p>\n<p>While their set included emotionally-striking songs that were a little on the slow side, they also included high-energy tunes that got the whole crowd to dance. The faster songs included empowering guitar solos and catchy melodies, while the slower ones transformed the venue into a wistful scene. While every song was unique on its own, each tune brought out romantic and heart-felt themes about love and equality.</p>\n<p>The showmanship of the combo also created a folksy mood that perfectly complimented the relaxed feel of the coffee shop. Band members smiled often, sipping on beers. They even described one of their songs, entitled “Runaway”, as a “beer drinking song,” and quickly turned this anecdote into a drinking game by encouraging the crowd to take a sip from their brews during certain lyrics.</p>\n<p>I stuck around after their set and had a chance to interview Modisette and Bergstrom as they were packing up their equipment. The lead lady singer told me about the creation of The Kinds, which sprang to life about five years ago. “Nate and I were playing together for a while when one of our close friends introduced us to Erich. Out of the blue, Anders showed up and starting playing with us,” said Modisette. “It all worked together really well, and the creation of the band was just kind of instant.”</p>\n<p>From there, The Kinds have focused on playing local shows with more casual intentions. “Part of the reason why I love playing with this ensemble is that everybody is on a professional level, but we just do it for fun,” explained Bergstrom with a gleeful look on his face. “This is our passion, and being able to play and have a great time doing it is really why we’re here.” From what I could tell, the convivial response from their close-knit Santa Barbara supporters is all The Kinds really need.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other bands, The Kinds have no desire to get signed. Apart from having daytime jobs and families to take care of, they come together as a band to focus most of their attention on enjoying the act of music-making. In regards to making it big, however, getting signed is one of their last priorities.</p>\n<p>“It’s almost not even a consideration. It just doesn’t seem like us,” said Modisette. Nodding his head, Bergstrom laughably commented that each member comes “from different facets of the music industry, and there was this interesting moment that we realized that we could be as good as anybody but not be as stressed as everybody else.” All in all, The Kinds are just a good-hearted, small-town band who wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>\n<p>As the night came to a close, it was certain that The Kinds’ nonchalant take on music and folksy tunes had once more left a warm impression on the guests of Muddy Waters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_haD3tnFRKo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57736\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57736\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-31/yellow-red-sparks-fly-as-the-kinds-join-in-at-muddy-waters/","id":7077,"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto"},"related":[7076,7075,7074],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tour Bus Interview With G-Eazy Before Sold-Out Hub Performance","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As I walked up the narrow steps of the white tour bus that was stationed behind the Hub, my eyes glazed at the lavishness of the interior of the vehicle.

In front of me was a lengthy figure sitting on crocodile-leather seats, wearing tight black skinny jeans, a plain black tee and a slick leather jacket. He stood up and extended his arm out to me to introduce himself. “Gerald,” he said, a sincere grin on his face. He offered me a drink and we sat down, turned to each other. Although I tried to play it off and act cool, I couldn’t help but tremble with nervousness at the surreal thought that I was about to interview G-Eazy for his sold-out show at the Hub.</p>\n<p>25-year-old Gerald Gillum, otherwise known as G-Eazy, is a popular rapper, songwriter and producer from Oakland, CA. His 2014 debut studio album entitled <em>These Things Happen</em> peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 chart, as created by a skyrocketing demand for the young artist’s addictive hip hop beats and lyrical control. Having just launched his nationwide “From the Bay to the Universe” tour, the Oakland rapper hit Santa Barbara on only the fourth day — Oct. 24.</p>\n<p>G-Eazy discovered his passion for rapping at the age of 14. He explained the strong sense of determination he felt when he realized that rapping is what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. “I just figured that if I’m going to do this, I want to do it and take it as far as I can go. I want to be a legend.” From what we can see today, this motivation has brought him to a successful music career.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>He continued to pursue his dedication to music throughout college. Having graduated from Loyola University New Orleans with a degree in music industry studies in 2011, G-Eazy is well-experienced with balancing both music and school. “Moving to New Orleans brought in my horizons,” he said. “I met my manager there, as well as other driven, like-minded people. I feel like college really helped give me that extra push I needed to get me to where I needed to be.”</p>\n<p>Gaining inspiration from notable artists such as the Beatles, Drake, Kanye West, Tupac and E40, G-Eazy combines hip hop and R&amp;B melodies with oldies and rock ’n’ roll. “I draw little pieces from music and use those influences to create my own songs,” he explained, sipping on a cup of hot coffee. “I’ll really like how this kick-drum sounds in this song, or the way this particular synth sounds, or this kind of a cord-progression, or this kind of a melody. I just take little pieces from a bunch of different places and pull it all together.”</p>\n<p>Despite G-Eazy’s catchy tunes and hooking rhythms, there’s a lot more to artist’s songs than their musical components, and that’s where his lyrical abilities come in. An admirable lyricist, G-Eazy aims to showcase his helter-skelter-type life. “My songs are about lifestyle,” he said with a kind nod. “They’re about my reaction, my perspective and my outlook on the world.”</p>\n<p>G-Eazy’s lifestyle is definitely not a normal one. From traveling around the country to promoting his latest album, a break is the last thing on the rapper’s mind. When describing his current tour, he was excited to tell me how well it was going — even on its fourth day in. “This is the best tour yet, by far. It’s just an honor to be able to tour with somebody like E40 — he’s a legend and I grew up listening to him, so it’s a privilege to share a bill like that.”</p>\n<p>Feeling rather like a mere outsider looking in, I had to ask how it felt to have reached number three on the Billboard 200 chart. “It’s all validation,” he said. “When I work in the studio, it’s this lonely process of creating something. All you can do is just hope it works. You just hope that what you’re making is going to resonate with people and you hope that they’re going to respond and like it. And when stuff like sold-out shows or being on the charts happens … that’s the return. It’s like ‘oh shit, this worked.’” He seemed proud of what he was saying — confident in his journey as an artist and what he is capable of accomplishing.</p>\n<p>As the interview was coming to an end, I asked if he had any advice for UCSB students wishing to step into the music industry. While at first he comically replied “don’t do drugs,” he continued on a more serious note. “Start whatever it is you want to be before you graduate — don’t wait until after college. It takes a lot of years on the runway to get the plane off the ground,” said G-Eazy. “College is kind of like this safe bubble — you think it sucks, but the real world really sucks. I would take all my free time in college working on music so that by the time I finished, hopefully that plane would be off the ground and I could be doing music full time.” From what I can tell, his strategy worked.</p>\n<p>Before I knew it, my time with the rapper came to a close as he was called to do a sound check. The line outside the Hub nearly extended to Storke Tower, with many UCSB students ready to have one of the best nights of their lives. G-Eazy performed songs such as “Downtown Love,” “Lady Killers,” “Let’s Get Lost” and of course, “I Mean It.”</p>\n<p>While the crowd didn’t have that one-on-one experience I was lucky enough to have, G-Eazy was just as inviting and enrapturing onstage in the Hub as he was in the interview. Soon enough I realized that the Oakland native’s charisma and ability to connect with people is exactly why the world just can’t get enough of him.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57513\" style=\"width: 566px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"536306097\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57508\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57513\" data-attachment-id=\"57513\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/geazy5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?fit=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"780,520\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?fit=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-57513\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?resize=556%2C370\" alt=\"Courtesy of hopelessthunder.org\" width=\"556\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?w=780&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/geazy5.png?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>hopelessthunder.org</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/images1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1496610293\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57508\"><br>\n</a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57508\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57508\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-28/tour-bus-interview-with-g-eazy-before-sold-out-hub-performance/","id":7633,"author":{"id":749,"name":"Alexandra DeSanto"},"related":[7632,7631,7630],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/749"}},"__N_SSG":true}
