Crocker Professor at USC Gould School of Law, discussed the importance of art in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement in a lecture titled “Race, Rap, and Redemption: The Role of Art in Promoting Racial Justice” at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) Thursday evening.</p>\n<p>During the lecture, Armour explored how art forms such as gangster rap, shed light on important issues including racial profiling, police brutality and mass incarceration. Armour has been a member of USC’s faculty since 1995 and studies several topics regarding relationships between racial justice, criminal justice and law enforcement. The lecture is part of MCC’S “Race Matters” series, which focuses on the role of racism and race in our society.</p>\n<p>Armour began the lecture by outlining racial profiling and the various social injustices it causes. According to Armour, the indignity and embarrassment of being racially profiled can be likened to “murdering an individual’s spirit.” Amour said the case of Sandra Bland, a Black woman who died in police custody in July, illustrates the damages of racial profiling.</p>\n<p>“Before Sandra Bland died, she was spirit-murdered,” Armour said. “Whoever took her life, whether it was by her hands or their hands, she had been spirit murdered to lead up to that suicide.”</p>\n<p>According to Armour, influential figures in the black community perpetuate negative attitudes toward Black men, such as Bill Cosby lecturing young black men on “pulling up their pants” and “naming their kids right.” Armour also said he employs the word “nigga” to emphasize problematic issues in the Black community.</p>\n<p>“The reason why I use that term to talk about social issues is because it gets at a mentality in the Black community that is very ugly and needs to change,” Armour said.</p>\n<p>Armour said the first time he gave the “Race, Rap, and Redemption” lecture was in USC’s Bovard auditorium to discuss the Stanley Tookie Williams case. During the event, guests used dance and music to express their opinions of the trial.</p>\n<p>“If you want to reach people at a visceral level, I find that art is the most effective way to get people to begin to empathize with people they might otherwise not find anything in common with at all,” Armour said.</p>\n<p>According to Armour, rap is a form of art that addresses racial profiling and police brutality in a way most other music does not. Amour said rap groups Public Enemy and NWA showed the perspective of Black persons in police brutality cases.</p>\n<p>“This is profound stuff in the profane. You have coarse brutal language to describe a coarse brutal reality,” Armour said. “It was a political oppositional discourse as profane as you can imagine.”</p>\n<p>According to a member of an African-American women’s sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha Charlotte A. Gullap-Moore, one reason for the prevalence of racial insensitivity is the lack of Black history education in U.S. schools.</p>\n<p>“The more education you have the more currency you have,” Moore said. “The reason why Public Enemy was so relevant was because they educated themselves on Black history, which is not disseminated in the school system.”</p>\n<p>Moore said Black history education should be introduced to schools beginning in primary school.</p>\n<p>“This is a process that should be implemented since kindergarten, not just for Black people but for all people because then it will limit cultural insensitivity,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said the “Race Matters” lecture series will continue throughout the school year.</p>\n<p>“We have great programs and I couldn’t be more thrilled with the calendar,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “This lecture [Race Rap and Redemption] was a way to kick-off the incoming year in a really critical, academic, engaging way.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article previously stated Charlotte A. Gullap-Moore is a representative of an African-American women’s sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. While Gullap-Moore is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha did not attend the lecture on behalf of the sorority.

UCSA meets monthly, and in its October meeting discussed the goals of the Student Advocacy, Governance, and Engagement (S.A.G.E.) fee, Million Student March, developing the role of Student Advocate to the Regents (StARs) and communications with the UC Office of the President.</p>\n<p>S.A.G.E. is a proposal that would establish a UC-wide, voluntary opt-out fee of six dollars per student to fund UCSA and is set to be established at the upcoming November Regents meeting. The Million Student March is a movement that demands tuition-free public college, cancellation of all student debt and a minimum $15 wage for all campus workers which will take place at campuses across the nation Nov. 12. StARs are UC students who attend Board of Regents meetings held every other month to converse with regents and to present student concerns, and UCSA hopes to increase the presence and influence of StARs at the meetings.</p>\n<p>UCSA President and fourth-year peace and conflict studies major at UC Berkeley Kevin Sabo said UCSA is funded by student associations across the UC campuses, and for individual UC’s to receive the benefits of UCSA at the state level the associations must pay their membership dues. According to Sabo, the SAGE fee would better connect students and decision makers.</p>\n<p>“Really what S.A.G.E. does is there is a lot of difficulties with students being able to get access to decision makers,” Sabo said. “With S.A.G.E., the UCSA would be able to really eliminate that barrier of accessibility and get students before those decision makers.”</p>\n<p>Sabo said students who are interested in going to Sacramento to lobby may have troubles paying for transportation and other expenses. According to Sabo, S.A.G.E. will allow UCSA to “spend more effectively.”</p>\n<p>“They have to front the cost to participate and then wait several weeks, even months, to get reimbursed,” Sabo said. “S.A.G.E. is really about stabilizing the organization, giving a better, more predictable outlook on what revenues are going to be like so we can budget for things like taking students to lobby on things like student loan debt or the Perkins Loans.”</p>\n<p>UCSA campus action vice chair and UCSB fourth-year global studies major Dana Patterson said the Million Student March is a “unique opportunity” to address the growing problem of student debt in the United States. According to Patterson, tuition freezes are not enough.</p>\n<p>“Every person in our community is affected by student debt,” Patterson said. “Student debt is greater than credit card debt … It has tripled in the last 10 years … education needs to be free, mainstream, and make politicians talk about it.”</p>\n<p>According to Patterson, the board meeting was “100 percent a success,” and UCSA passed a resolution for the UCs to contribute to the efforts of the Million Student March on individual campuses. Patterson said she encourages students across the nation to participate in the Million Student March at their campus.</p>\n<p>“This is for every student to get involved, and I encourage any who wants to join this movement to come,” Patterson said.</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley graduate student Iman Sylvain said StARs are allowed to provide comments at UC Regents Board meetings and meet with Regents in private settings such as in break rooms or while getting lunch.</p>\n<p>“We have a wonderful program that gives students a back door access to the ability to really interface genuinely with the Regents, because they are kind of an elusive group,” Sylvain said.</p>\n<p>Sylvain said StARs representatives are able to advocate for issues relevant to UC students.</p>\n<p>“We’ve talked about student homelessness, we’ve talked about renewing the act for sexual assault prevention training for faculties, we also talked about mental health and the cost of living has been huge,” Sylvain said.</p>\n<p>According to Sylvain, UCSA is working on developing more personal relationships with Regents through StARs in order for the Regents to better understand the student perspective.</p>\n<p>“For example, the housing crisis — you can see that, you can see students sleeping in their cars or showering at the gym,” Sylvain said. “The Regents are very removed from the on-campus situation … So we are trying to engage [the Regents] in different ways.”</p>\n<p>According to Sylvain, UCSA is “only” scheduled to meet with the UC Office of the President three hours a year.</p>\n<p>“We are definitely pushing for the president to take more meetings and to have more ongoing conversations with them,” Sylvain said. “What are the ways to be in constant communication with the Office of the President?”</p>\n<p>Sylvain said UCSA advocates for a “genuine” shared government between administration, faculty and students.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t we have a vote — why don’t we have a say when it comes to decision making?” Sylvain said. “We want more than just our ‘foot in the door;’ we want a seat at the table.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65330\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-meeting-addresses-student-debt-improving-communication-between-students-and-regents/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65330\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-meeting-addresses-student-debt-improving-communication-between-students-and-regents/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-meeting-addresses-student-debt-improving-communication-between-students-and-regents/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-meeting-addresses-student-debt-improving-communication-between-students-and-regents/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-meeting-addresses-student-debt-improving-communication-between-students-and-regents/","id":3614,"author":{"id":152,"name":"Erica Schweitzer"},"related":[3613,3612,3611],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/152"}},"__N_SSG":true}
