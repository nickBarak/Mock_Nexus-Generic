Or, you could just watch the video of his Batcave session, which works too.</p>\n<p>Kuperman sauntered into the <em>Daily Nexus</em> to record a Batcave live session looking like your everyday typical chilled-out rocker — not-quite-tattered-but-still-slouchy shirt, black earrings, a random assortment of necklaces and bracelets, a droopy baseball-esque cap worn backwards and, of course, holding a skateboard in one hand. Kupe is essentially the personification of the word “chill;” he easily lounges on a chair in the office while draping his arm across the back, casually joking around with a lazy smile on his lips. It’s hard to picture him getting worked up about anything, until that is, he picks up his guitar. All of sudden, a wicked gleam overtakes his eyes and he deftly busts out a few complicated-sounding chords while waiting for the videographer to set up his equipment, without breaking a sweat. His fingers seem to have a mind of their own and his gaze flutters from the guitar, to the walls, to the camera, all around as the rest of his body accommodates the melodies emanating from the instrument — complete with foot tapping and head bobbing. And we haven’t even started the actual session yet.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When we finally sat down for an interview, Kupe effortlessly assumed his natural, laidback persona again, sinking into the couch while mindlessly tapping his foot. Again, the topic of music seems to stir him from this relaxed state into something more passionate. Not surprisingly, music has been a most of Kuperman’s life. “Since I was, like, a little one, my dad turned me onto a bunch of music he was listening to at the time, a lot of rock music.” It wasn’t until he was around eleven, after having played the saxophone for a short while, that he first picked up a guitar and formed an informal band with some friends, attempting to emulate popular rock giants such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Guns ‘n’ Roses. His interest in slap guitar came a bit later, after seeing a fellow guitarist Andy McKee on the Internet. “I remember on YouTube, there’s this video of Andy McKee playing this song called ‘Drifting.’ It was full of this crazy stuff, he was like slapping the guitar and doing all these crazy rhythmic things and I just thought like, ‘Wow that’s cool.’”</p>\n<p>If you watch this video and think, “Man, that looks like such a difficult style of music to perform, it must’ve taken him so much formal training to get the hang of it!” you’d be only partially right. While it did take Kuperman some time to master the style — “It was like learning how to play the guitar again, almost” — he never actually learned how to formally play slap guitar. Instead, he just sat down one day and started messing around with rhythmic and percussive elements until it blossomed into the impressive showing you see here today. “I think it’s just guitar playing with just a little extra something thrown in. Probably just comes from guitar players when they’re not playing with other people wanting to, and being able to, create a full sounding thing by yourself.” Not exactly an easy task, so it understandably took him a while to figure out the “rhythmic difficulties” involved.</p>\n<p>Foot tapping away, with what I now began to realize was a characteristic wild look in his eyes, Kupe began to excitedly tell me about how slap guitar style “opened up a new door of guitar playing.” He continued, “people find themselves so limited on one instrument, like you can only do this or this, standard stuff. But like, you know, this is an instrument and when it comes down to it, this is a thing that makes noise and sound and you can get so much out of it.”</p>\n<p>Luckily, the smaller, raw nature of the Isla Vista music scene, which welcomes talent of all shapes and sizes, suits David’s interests just fine. “That’s my ideal show: dingy show, relatively small place, but packed with people because then there are no rules and, like, it kinda has more character to it.” What he brings to I.V. is a unique, bluesy slap guitar style that can liven up even the dullest open mic or small house show. But that’s not the only form of music Kuperman hopes to perform here in I.V. “I’m forming a band right now, and this is me playing electric, which is very different from my acoustic playing. Basically my other musical half, my like, blues-rock alternative kind of playing — very loud and crude, but like energetic stuff.” This band will definitely bring an exciting underrepresented blues-rock sound to I.V. — once he finds a drummer that is, which has been the biggest roadblock he’s faced so far.</p>\n<p>Between electric guitar and acoustic slap guitar, it’s clear to see that, while slap guitar is what David calls, “my core, that’s my soul, some of the music I write that I really call my art,” he prefers performing his electric rock music. “It’s the performance, it’s the energy, like, it’s rock and roll, that’s more what it’s about.” Don’t worry though, you’ll still be able to catch Kupe jamming out with his slap guitar music around Isla Vista (and this Batcave session) pretty regularly, but he’ll soon be playing some loud, bluesy, alternative rock music with his to-be-determined band. If you just can’t wait, look his name up, “David Kuperman” on SoundCloud, or search him on YouTube to listen and watch a few of his original song compositions. Besides that, catch him tearing up the streets of I.V. at a house show near you soon enough, or pop into an open mic whenever you’re free — chances are you’ll spot him going nuts on a poor acoustic guitar, delivering some interesting and rock-inspired slap guitar melodies.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOjdsnQyMvU&amp;feature=youtu.be</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67582\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67582\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-24/david-kuperman-batcave-session/","id":6816,"author":{"id":726,"name":"Brenda Munive"},"related":[6815,6814,6813],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Azeem X Underbelly Return to Santa Barbara","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AzeemxUnderbelly_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AzeemxUnderbelly_by-Riley-Esguerra-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Walking into the dimly lit room at SOhO in downtown Santa Barbara Thursday night was a bit like walking into a reunion with old friends.

Groups of people were scattered across the room or sitting at tables anticipating Azeem Ward’s first public performance with Timmy Linetsky — otherwise known as Underbelly, who is a current student at UC Santa Barbara and Ward’s co-headliner for the night — in Santa Barbara since he graduated last spring. “We met one night at an open mic right after he blew up. We jammed once or twice and then spent the whole summer planning tour dates in Europe,” said Underbelly. The duo travelled all over Europe this summer, bringing their unique fusion of beatbox flute and jazzy hip-hop electronic bass music to people who had watched Ward’s senior flute recital last year when he became an overnight internet sensation in the United Kingdom. This concert was Ward’s discreet homecoming, and many of his close friends were in attendance. “I was really worried no one would come because we could have promoted it better, but a lot of people ended up being here,” said Underbelly. The night began with a DJ set, which the crowd met with mild enthusiasm, up until the last song where a break-dancer took over the floor with dangerous-looking dance moves.</p>\n<p>As soon as Azeem Ward and Underbelly set up on stage, the pit flooded with the bodies of excited college students. Not long after, a surprise special guest — rapper DGA, who has been close friends with Underbelly since high school — took the stage. Their first song was a funky collaboration between the two of them, where Ward showed off his signature beatbox flute. The crowd’s response to hearing Ward’s unconventional music was overwhelmingly positive. “The crowd had a lot of hype considering the size. People really respond to Ward, they are genuinely into it, not in a condescending way,” said DGA. “People know this is kind of funny because its flute, but they also know it’s really good.” The trio soon started playing groovier and groovier songs, such as a flute remix of “Sexy Back” by Justin Timberlake.</p>\n<p>The night then took a more sensual turn when Underbelly announced that he and Ward were about to play some slower, sexier tunes. If the audience was not aware before, they instantly became believers in the fact that the flute could create some sexy beats as Ward continued to deliver smooth note after smooth note. Frequent beat changes and seamless runs defined Ward’s covers and original music, keeping the crowd mesmerized.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Before the tempo changed from slick and slow to sleep-inducing, Ward and Underbelly reintroduced DGA onstage. The arrival of DGA prompted Ward to announce to the relaxed crowd that he was about to play some of his harder songs. The audience quickly learned what his “hard songs” were high intensity party songs that rekindled the previously calmer energy in the venue. However, it wasn’t until Ward and Underbelly played the first note of their famous cover of Darude’s “Sandstorm” did the crowd completely lose any inhibitions they may have had, grooving and dancing along to the beats. Ward’s flute melodies coaxed the more whimsical personality traits of a few of the concert goers to surface — some boys mimed having a tea party on the venue floor as everyone proceeded to wildly dance and mosh around them.</p>\n<p>Throughout the night, the crowd remained completely supportive of their fellow Gauchos Ward and Underbelly. The night progressed as if Ward was playing at a friend’s house show rather than a venue in downtown Santa Barbara. “I expected to see a lot of friends from back home, but I didn’t expect many other people to come since we had to promote this ourselves,” said Ward. “This show was a lot of fun, when you have a connection with people it’s easier to play.” The crowd even broke into the famous UC Santa Barbara “Olè Gaucho” chant, to which Ward adorably shuffled to onstage right before taking a group picture with anyone who could fit into the camera frame.</p>\n<p>Although this small, intimate concert didn’t garner as much attention or press as Ward’s grand senior flute recital, Ward preferred the cozier setting. “My recital was a lot of pressure, this one was a lot more fun,” Ward said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

concluded with their Block Party at the Funk Zone featuring Gardens &amp; Villa and Run the Jewels, on Sunday, Oct. 18. Bustling food trucks lined the venue, which spanned a small outdoor stretch of parking lot.</p>\n<p>The audience was fairly heterogeneous. In one corner of the venue, a visibly annoyed high school student tried to escape his hovering mother. In another section, an elderly couple slowly crept towards the main stage. Most of the young adults congregated at the beer garden.</p>\n<p>Gardens &amp; Villa took the stage. Immediately, the crowd synced up with Garden’s keyboard-heavy indie pop music. Crowd members couldn’t look away from the psychedelic light show onstage and grooved along to Chris Lynch’s slight raspy but ethereal vocals.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Lynch unexpectedly punctuated Garden’s colorful set with his flute. Projections of spindly spiders on the wall accompanied the Lynch’s flute.</p>\n<p>Before Run the Jewels went on, some fans rushed to the front to ensure that anyone who was less than six feet tall had a very difficult time seeing anything other than a sea of shoulders and heads. Adam Schmidt, a second-year computer science major, UCSB’s College of Creative Studies said, “The sound guy came up and did sound checks for 15 minutes which were punctuated by his ‘Yeahs’ and ‘Alrights,’ sounding like a slightly more decipherable Lil John record stuck on repeat.” The man onstage instead “seemed to be doing his job of hyping pretty well, as soon the fans were cheering loudly for Run the Jewels,” Schmidt said.</p>\n<p>Finally, RtJ MCs El-P and Killer Mike made their grand appearance, in the process driving some fans into a frantic mosh pit in the middle of the audience. The duo opened up not with one of their own songs, but instead led the crowd in a rousing rendition of a “We Are the Champions” sing-along, while El-P proclaimed that he had gained superpowers from all of the weed he smoked before the show.</p>\n<p>Run the Jewel’s set had no shortage of vulgarity — middle fingers and drug references were staples throughout the night — but the duo did not hesitate to voice their political opinions or call out fans who they felt were restricting anyone else’s enjoyment. Killer Mike and El-P made their disapproval of the government clear, and told a daring photographer who saw fit to climb the railing that he had to move because “[the photographer’s] dick is in kids’ faces.” These instances where the duo spoke what was on their minds served to amp the crowd’s excitement to a higher level than it already was.</p>\n<p>To add to the energy, the chemistry between the rappers was palpable. “Honestly I heard they were really good performers before and they pretty much kept up with that reputation; the energy was really good and they were hilarious,” Chet Manley, a UC Santa Cruz graduate student, said. “Killer Mike and El-P are adorable together; they totally had like a bromance thing going on.” The end result was that nobody in the crowd ever stopped moving — the guys in the mosh pit went from pushing each other around to punching each other in the face, and everyone else quickly forgot any inhibitions they may have had about dancing in front of strangers.</p>\n<p>Eventually, after a much requested encore, Run the Jewels finished their set and left the stage, leaving everyone in the audience with dazzling memories and sore bodies. “In essence, Run the Jewels captured the spirit of the crowd and ran f*cking laps with it … Well worth 25 dollars and far cheaper than a diamond necklace,” Schmidt concluded.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65777\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65777\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-26/new-noise-block-party-features-run-the-jewels-and-gardens-villas/","id":6878,"author":{"id":726,"name":"Brenda Munive"},"related":[6877,6876,6875],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tijuana Panthers Rock New Noise","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tijuana_Panthers_Press_Photo_2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tijuana_Panthers_Press_Photo_2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Velvet Jones in downtown Santa Barbara is a venue that attracts a diverse group of music lovers — anyone ranging from angst-ridden teenagers to adults attempting to relive their glory days.

At every corner there were guys who looked like they were part of a band and girls who wanted to seem as though they had a diverse taste in music. The lights were dimmed, so it was difficult to see the giant poster of Johnny Cash flipping everyone off or the expressions of the adults hanging around the bar pounding away their beers.</p>\n<p>The crowd itself was relatively calm; most of the audience talked at a quiet murmur, while everyone else was absorbed in their phones. This ambiance changed once the first band, Royal Suns, came out. After that, the atmosphere progressively became more excited. Once the Aquadolls came out singing “Tweaker Kidz” off their newest album, the audience’s energy level elevated to the point where some people began to dance to Melissa Brooks’ bubbly voice and the upbeat instrumentals. Joseph Olivo, a high school student, decided that this was the perfect time to go crazy, despite the fact that everyone else in the crowd was content with simply swaying to the beat. “This is my eighth time seeing them. The whole band is just amazing,” he said as he stood panting and sweating through his Summer Twins long-sleeve baseball t-shirt.</p>\n<p>Not even Joseph was prepared for how insane the crowd became once the headliner, the Tijuana Panthers, took the stage. The second the band played the first note of “Creature,” everyone in the audience erupted into a giant mosh pit that remained a constant fixture throughout their set. Suddenly, the area in front of the stage was flooded with a medley of rowdy teenagers and older adults aggressively dancing as the Tijuana Panthers played back-to-back tracks from all three of their albums.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The band took minimal breaks, pausing only to politely refuse an audience member’s enthusiastic suggestion to “Take it off!” Luckily, the crowd was not discouraged and continued to vigorously move around the pit; there was not one body that stayed still during their entire set. The only time the audience went crazier than usual was when the band began playing songs from their very first album. Phil Shaheen, the drummer for the Tijuana Panthers, agreed, “I think the old ones from our first record—they, like, always get a good reaction. Everyone sings along and stuff; it seems like the tendency is to go hard.” As the night wore on, the air inside the venue became thicker and thicker with the sweat of both the audience members and the band, to the point where everyone was drenched.</p>\n<p>Because of how rowdy the crowd was, some of the sweat that clung to people’s bodies didn’t always belong to them. Sadly, after about an hour-long set the band bid the audience farewell. Naturally, no one in the crowd wanted to accept that their wild night was coming to a close, and an urgent cry for an encore quickly arose from all areas of the venue. Not the type to disappoint their fans, Tijuana Panthers dutifully came back onstage and played three more songs before finally saying goodbye. Chad Wachtel, the guitarist, was sweet enough to stay behind to converse with some of the audience members and take picture with them, while the rest of the band seemed in a hurry to pack their equipment onto their truck. Surprisingly, their eagerness to tear down their set was due to the fact that the band members had to drive back to their hometown in Long Beach, CA. “I mean, I’m going back to work tomorrow morning,” Shaheen said. “You gotta do something unless you’re huge — you gotta make ends meet somehow.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara can most definitely expect another appearance by the Tijuana Panthers. “We’re for sure coming back,” bassist Daniel Michcoff said. “We’re aiming for [the Santa Barbara bowl].”</p>\n<p>Their promise to come back is definitely great news to new fan David Kuperman, a second year communication and philosophy major at UC Santa Barbara. “My friend dragged me to the show, but I’m very glad I went. The music was fantastic, well-organized and high energy. I would definitely come see them again,” Kuperman said</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQqQ9kfZUn0</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/tijuana-panthers-rock-new-noise/","id":6925,"author":{"id":726,"name":"Brenda Munive"},"related":[6924,6923,6922],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/726"}},"__N_SSG":true}
