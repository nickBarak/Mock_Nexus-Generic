The Executive Board also jointly proposed to tack on additional changes that would allow Elections Committee to disqualify candidates for ethical reasons.</p>\n<p>Elections Committee Chair Hannah Yen said the revisions were made after the committee conceded that imposing a limit on the recruitment period was not realistic.</p>\n<p>“In the recruitment section, recruitment is no longer having restrictions,” Yen said. “We don’t want to punish people. And realistically, if it’s happening, then we want to allow for that in the code … We are trying to do the best we can to accommodate what we think is best for the students and for you all.”</p>\n<p>However, second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja said dropping the additional changes would result in the committee not holding parties accountable for their actions.</p>\n<p>“It sounds like you’re addressing that there is a problem and basically just conceding to that,” Ahuja said. “I’m kind of confused about how this actually solves anything.”</p>\n<p>Yen said her goal is to make the elections process as open to student involvement as possible.</p>\n<p>“Different violations come up, different campaign strategies come up,” Yen said. “So we are always trying to make the process as fair and impartial as possible, and as open as possible and accessible to students.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President Sophia Armen said the Executive Board’s proposal would give Elections Committee the power to disqualify students for the use of A.S. funds for personal affairs, the deliberate and public misrepresentation of the association and other ethical issues.</p>\n<p>Student Advocate General Yoel Haile said the responsibility to ensure that candidates were indicted for ethical violations fairly would lie with the Judicial Council.</p>\n<p>“We believe this to be the baseline … of what kind of ethical parameters should elected folks be held to. We’ve thought very long and hard about this,” Haile said. “If the Judicial Council finds that the student is responsible for violating these codes as the baseline, that Elections Committee be empowered to disqualify that student.”</p>\n<p>Many Senators brought up concerns with the proposal. Off-Campus Senator Kyley Scarlet said it should be in the hands of the students to judge the character of each candidate, rather than the association.</p>\n<p>“Shouldn’t the student body be the ones deciding the moral standards of their leaders, not this code?” Scarlet asked.</p>\n<p>Yen said the Elections committee does not endorse the Executive Board’s proposal.</p>\n<p>“The Committee does not want this in our code because we do not feel that this is part of our charge,” Yen said. “I hope that you take into account the fact that this is not something we wanted.”</p>\n<p>Rhandy Siordia, External Vice President of Local Affairs, said the new ideas came about as a result of issues that have occurred in past elections.</p>\n<p>“This is indeed a response. It would be a response to historical precedent,” Siordia said. “Has [an infraction like the ones mentioned in the proposal] happened in the past? Yes.”</p>\n<p>After hours of debate, including a ‘working meeting’ in which the Senate abandoned the restrictions of the official meeting process and talked through the ideas in a circle on the floor, Senators passed the changes proposed by Elections Committee, but did not approve the ethics requirement proposed by the Executive Officers.</p>\n<p>After the Senate passed a resolution that would support CALPIRG in an effort to repeal the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Citizens United v. FEC, three Senators exited the room abruptly, leaving the Senate without the requisite number of members present to adjourn the meeting. Next week, Senate will resume where it left off in this week’s agenda.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/a-s-senators-consider-changes-to-elections-campaign-process/","id":3111,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3110,3109,3108],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Student Organizations Will Compete for Funds Created by A.S.

Groups will compete for the funds, with the two best project proposals receiving $5,000 each.</p>\n<p>A.S. Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez, the architect behind the legislation, said the federal failure to invest in innovation initially inspired him to propose the fund.</p>\n<p>“NASA has no funding now. The United States is ranked 22nd in science and technology. That’s appalling,” Martinez said. “We can’t compete with countries on the rise like India and China when it comes to this kind of stuff.”</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, having student government support the sciences would help rekindle the innovative spirit of the United States.</p>\n<p>“$10,000 isn’t a lot, but it helps a bit,” Martinez said. “It helps contribute to people wanting to do something outside of the classroom and hopefully be like, ‘Maybe I can work on this for the federal government in the future.’”</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, president of UCSB’s Residence Halls Association, added that STARK allows A.S. to support and reach out to science and engineering students.</p>\n<p>“Students who work in the science-technology field on campus are really underserved by A.S.,” Abboud said. “A.S. does a lot to benefit certain groups, but one of the groups that A.S. hasn’t aided to — as much as other groups — is the science population.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the lack of dissent the bill faced from the Senate signified the widespread acknowledgement of its importance.</p>\n<p>“We don’t see a lot of engineers and we don’t see a lot of hard-science people in A.S.,” Martinez said. “A.S. has no form of grants that we give to projects. It’s time that we do that. It’s time that we reach out to those people who want to do hands-on projects … There was no opposition [from the Senate]; I think that shows that people understand the issues at hand.”</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau, who serves as an off-campus Senator for A.S. and officially proposed the bill to the Senate, pointed out the advantages that STARK could have for students attempting to pad their résumés.</p>\n<p>“I really think that this is a great direction that A.S. is going into, because … we’re also helping career paths,” Lau said. “Really when it comes down to it, your résumé is kind of everything.”</p>\n<p>Lau said she hopes to eventually expand the idea to other fields of study, making student government funds more accessible for academic pursuits.</p>\n<p>“It would really help to expand it to even writing groups — people who are English or art majors who want to publish art magazines and writing magazines,” Lau said. “It’s a great avenue to have money specifically for students to do things that will benefit their future.”</p>\n<p>However, Abboud said he feels that it is most important to address science-focused organizations, since these groups are most underrepresented in A.S.</p>\n<p>“We kind of already do fund different things … I don’t think that we should create another fund specifically for them,” Abboud said. “It’s better to have a specific one for science and technology, because they don’t feel right now that A.S. helps and caters to them … It’s good to put that institutional backing to the science groups.”</p>\n<p>Raul Martinez plans to contact every Office of Student Life organization that is science-related within the next week as the beginning steps of the $5,000 competition. The bill will go into effect next year.</p>\n<h6><em> A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the February 6th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50149\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50149\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-06/student-organizations-will-compete-for-funds-created-by-a-s-senates-stark-bill/","id":3109,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3108,3107,3106],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

In addition to other topics, student representatives debated the benefits and drawbacks of oil company divestments, while also measuring the fiscal downside to divesting from companies that emit fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Emily Williams, who acts as the statewide affairs coordinator for Environmental Affairs Board, requested the senate’s support in divesting from businesses with larger carbon footprints.</p>\n<p>Williams said the board is pursuing the support A.S. since they plan to take their proposal to the Board of Regents. She said it is necessary for the senate to set an example in such environmental efforts since UCSB holds such a strong reputation as a ‘green’ campus’.</p>\n<p>“It is almost hypocritical, in a way, for us to be invested in fossil fuels,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Raul Martinez, chair of Finance Board, questioned the fiscal impact of EAB’s proposal, saying it is inevitable the university turn to these companies.</p>\n<p>“Companies, firms, non-profits — they all have investments in portfolios and most of them have chairs in Exxon or Mobile. The reason is because it pays dividends,” Martinez said. “If you don’t have a company that pays that kind of dividend … that money needs to come from somewhere.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Martinez said such financial losses could translate into higher costs for students.</p>\n<p>“So either there are going to be cuts, or tuition is going to increase, or whatever they want to do,” Martinez said. “Universities need revenue now more than ever.”</p>\n<p>As the discussion wore on, off-campus senator Alex Choate asked how the senate could find the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p>“So I was wondering — is there another away that we can incorporate this, remaining socially responsible?” Choate said.</p>\n<p>In response, Martinez said senate members should take concerns for human rights into greater account than environmental concerns.</p>\n<p>“I’d rather be invested in companies that are in oil and energy, so long as they don’t violate human rights,” Martinez said. “This is going to sound really bad … but I’d rather be socially responsible to the students than to the environment.”</p>\n<p>However, Williams said ecological issues are equally important since they overlap with various other social issues.</p>\n<p>“By degrading the environment, it affects frontline communities,” Williams said. “People … whose water is polluted, who are experiencing more and more cases of asthma, of cancer — these are real things that are happening.”</p>\n<p>The plan would not be costly since the UC Regents would ensure transitional costs not reach the pockets of students, according to Williams.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson disagreed, saying past Regents decisions have not represented students.</p>\n<p>“I am going to have to disagree with you a little bit when you say that the regents prioritize the students first,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Without reaching any conclusion regarding the divestments, senators shifted their focus toward A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>Senators Tuquan Harrison and Hayley Gilbert proposed a plan to restrict the elections recruitment period to two weeks to allow for more “transparency.”</p>\n<p>However, some senators said restricting recruitment time would make it more difficult for party members to find the most qualified students, amongst other concerns.</p>\n<p>The senate agreed to table the bill for one week so they could eventually reach a more informed decision.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of January 31st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Kaur earned the position by merit of her status as the next runner-up by number of votes in last spring’s A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>Several members of on-campus organiza- tions came to the public forum portion in sup- port of revisions to the A.S. constitution, which would include additional training requirements for senators in order to better prepare them for dealing with sexual harassment-related issues.</p>\n<p>Alex Moore, Co-Chair of Take Back the Night, offered his support for the new requirements. He argued that a trick- le-down education approach would greatly benefit the general student body by setting an example for other campus organizations.</p>\n<p>“It’s great to start a change in the culture from leader- ship down,” Moore said. “I highly encourage you to add the requirement.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair Danielle Bermudez echoed this sentiment, adding that an informed population of students would go a long way towards preventing sexual crimes.</p>\n<p>“Education — that’s the first step to ending sexual vio- lence,” Bermudez said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students President Sophia Armen addressed the Senate about a UC system-wide campus climate survey called “Answer the CALL,” which is designed to gauge various measures the campus atmosphere in order to bet- ter prevent discrimination and hate crimes. Armen said she would like to see a 40 percent response to the survey, which was distributed to every student through U-Mail, but so far, only about 10 percent of the student body has responded.</p>\n<p>Armen said she believes low participation results may be a result of the uncertainty surrounding survey’s purpose. “Part of the reason why there has been an initial student reluctance … is because of [students wondering,] ‘What are we going to do with the data?’” Armen said.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Armen stressed the importance of filling out the survey by the deadline of January 25th in order to add representative student input to potential university changes.</p>\n<p>“Whether or not you do take it, they are going to use the information,” she said. “If you don’t take it, it’s not going to represent you.</p>\n<p>Following Armen’s report, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Nadim Houssain spoke before the Senate about financial concerns for the University of California system and potential structural changes to the institution.</p>\n<p>Houssain said Proposition 30’s passage helped make Governor Brown’s recently proposed state budget a little more optimistic for the UC than it has been in years past.</p>\n<p>“Thanks to the passage of Prop 30, the government has followed up on its promise to contribute 250 million dollars to the UC system,” Houssain said.</p>\n<p>Houssain said he was unsure whether the allocation of a portion of that money towards online education is a worthy investment for the university.</p>\n<p>“What really concerns [me] is the complete online education,” Houssain said, contrasting “complete” online education with supplementary online materials to tradi- tional classes. “Not everyone has access to a computer or the internet … This shift would put grad students [who work as TAs] out of work … How do you enforce academic integrity [through online courses]?”</p>\n<p>Houssain also noted the possible negative effects that implementing online courses — which currently range in price from $1,400 to $2,400 — will have on lower-income students.</p>\n<p>“It may stratify students based on class,” Houssain said. “Those with more money will be able to afford in-class education while those in lower income brackets will opt for cheaper online classes, and I wouldn’t want to see that happen.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 24th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Additionally, Patel and Gallegos also attributed their respective resignations to an inabil- ity to balance senatorial duties with other responsi- bilities.</p>\n<p>In a debate about meeting length, Kennedy claimed lengthy meetings were an impor- tant factor in the overwhelming number of resignations.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already had one third of the Senate quit for this reason,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>Senator Ben Green, who does not plan to quit Senate, noted the weight of their responsibilities, taking the absence of Senate members at the meeting as a sign that the senators were being worked too hard.</p>\n<p>“I see a lot of empty seats and that’s indicative of the stress the Senate puts on us,” Green said.</p>\n<p>Segovia announced during that same meeting that she had met with A.S. mem- bers from other UC campuses and had been surprised to learn that none of them had dealt with resignations.</p>\n<p>While last week’s bill to cut off meet- ings at 9:45 p.m. did not pass, Senators did resolve to brainstorm ways to make meet- ings more efficient and thus less stressful. Nevertheless, the four resigned former- senators were not persuaded to remain.</p>\n<p>In light of last night’s resignations, Off- Campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson</p>\n<p>delivered an emotional address stating her personal frustration toward the situation.</p>\n<p>“This is killing me. This is ridiculous,” Christianson said. “I think everyone in this room can tell how much it’s affecting us.”</p>\n<p>Christianson continued to argue that meetings were in fact getting shorter as everyone had begun to become acclimated to their positions.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better at it. Our 4:00 a.m. meetings were the first few meetings of the year,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>She then called for more honesty between senators and implored them to remember their duties to the student body.</p>\n<p>“More than anything, I want us all to be honest with each other. Please be hon- est with the Senate,” Christianson said. “Remember why you ran for this. Why are you here? It’s a big friggin’ deal … You have so much more power than people who want to make a difference … We have to be that outlet when people have grievances.”</p>\n<p>The new resignations leave several open seats in the Senate. If the people who received the second-highest number of votes in last spring’s elections do not choose to fill those spots, the Internal Vice President will be forced to begin a new application process.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 17th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49463\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49463\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-17/resignations-leave-seats-empty-senate/","id":3106,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3105,3104,3103],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

He added that the resignations of eightsenators during Fall quarter were likely due to the extensive length of meetings, which end anytime between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. with last night’s meeting coming to a close at 9 p.m.</p>\n<p>“We figured we needed to change the culture of the Senate,” Kennedy said, referring to himself and Harrison. “I don’t think this bill is an end-all but I think it’s a really good start.”</p>\n<p>Despite the support of several senators, the bill faced adamant opposition from executive officers and some Public Forum speakers. A.S. President Sophia Armen voiced con- cerns about A.S. members’ dedication and accountability, stating that Senate should not be treated as an easy job and senators should willingly listen to the input of all public forum speakers.</p>\n<p>“This job is hard. You should have all known that going in,” Armen said. “In my opinion, the most people we should be listening to are the people who walk in here … If any of you are resigning because of this — that is unacceptable…The reality is, it’s not about enjoying.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Mayra Segoviap said in her past meetings with A.S. organizations of other schools, there were noticeably fewer resignations.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, on-campus senator Kevin Rudolph voiced his support by claiming that other schools had similar time limits, adding that long meetings cause him to question his own dedication to the group.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, to come here, I love what I’m doing but this meeting is most of the time a burden and it’s very unproduc- tive,” Rudolph said. “I know that other schools have time limits or things like that. I would like to see this [bill] passed.”</p>\n<p>In response to such claims, Armen said students should maintain better focus or initiate more efficient practices in meetings instead of simply slashing meeting times.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that half of the discussion going on in this room isn’t even the projects,” Armen said. “Instead of having 25 minutes of discussion on productivity, why not actually be productive?”</p>\n<p>Adeel Lakhani, who acts as the Commissioner of Academic Affairs in the A.S. Office of the President, rec- ognized the importance of reducing stress for senators but agreed that longer meetings can be necessary to ensure that all business is finished.</p>\n<p>“I do recognize that there is a need to retain senators and make the job easier,” Lakhani said. “But sometimes a four- and-a-half hour meeting isn’t long enough for Senate business … Your meetings take time and your discussions are tough because that’s the nature of what comes to you.”</p>\n<p>Senators resolved to table — essentially postpone — the bill indefinitely. However, there was agreement that A.S. members would spend time at future meetings brainstorming and discussing new methods of increasing productivity and decreasing meeting length.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 10, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-10/approves-shorter-meetings/","id":3104,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3103,3102,3101],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

They also approved the Investment Advisory Committee’s investments and discussed a new plan to make taxi rides more accessible to students with limited funds.</p>\n<p>The Chinese Student Association approached the Senate during public forum requesting approximately $3,000 for their upcoming masquerade ball in downtown Santa Barbara, for which they need transportation, decorations and advertising. They would charge participants $30 each, some of which would go back to the organization.</p>\n<p>Though Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez was reluctant to speak for Finance Board before an official vote, he said they would be concerned about the fee as the event may be considered a fundraiser.</p>\n<p>“If the Senate approved the money, it would need to be a one-time exception,” Martinez said. “We would be concerned about the $30 fee. We can’t [fund] decorations, [and] we don’t fund more than $250 for audio,” he added.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Angela Lau noted the differences between a philanthropic event and a fundraiser.</p>\n<p>“They aren’t doing philanthropy, so we can’t fund them,” Lau said. “They are selling tickets which are supposed to go back to funding their event. We don’t fund fundraisers.”</p>\n<p>When asked whether CSA had approached other organizations for money, because of their intention to provide an alternative to the Isla Vista party scene, member Angel Chin said they had not been successful.</p>\n<p>“It has been a week past [since we asked for money from After Dark] and we haven’t heard anything from them so I’m not sure we are getting anything,” she said. She had not contacted any other organizations.</p>\n<p>Lao was also concerned about the location of the event.</p>\n<p>“It’s off-campus and we try to keep our funds for on-campus events,” she said. “We only fund events that are for the students.”</p>\n<p>Senators voted to approve zero dollars for the CSA. Senator Ashley Koide wanted to clarify that this was not out of spite.</p>\n<p>“It seems like it’s really bad that we’re giving zero but it’s just a policy thing,” she said.</p>\n<p>After voting against funding the CSA, the Senate voted to approve investments made by the Investment Advisory Committee. The IAC manages the Associated Student’s stock holdings and monitors different companies to decide when to sell and when to invest to make a profit for the student budget. Senators were generally supportive of the IAC’s decisions, but one company’s past legal issues concerned certain members.</p>\n<p>Proxy Senator Will Ellis brought up the potential issues with Kansas City Southern as an investment because of their legal past.</p>\n<p>“[There was a] race-based discrimination lawsuit filed against KCS,” he said. “It’s cool that we got that money [from that investment], but [the suit] should make us reluctant to invest in that company.”</p>\n<p>Senator Alex Choate countered that the suit had been dealt with and was therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p>“Since this issue was resolved, I’d feel comfortable investing in it as long as we make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” she said.</p>\n<p>The Senate voted to approve all investments; however, they resolved to keep an eye on KCS in order to prevent association with discriminatory companies.</p>\n<p>In addition, External Vice President of Local Affairs Rhandy Siordia proposed an initiative to provide taxicab rides to students who did not have immediate access to appropriate fare. He said they would need to set up a $5,000 account with the Yellow Cab.</p>\n<p>“It would be a revolving account,” Siordia said. “Students would give the taxi driver their perm number, address, et cetera and then the cab ride would be paid for with [the Yellow Cab account]. [That money would then be] taken from the student’s BARC account and given back to the Yellow Cab fund.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the financial affairs debated in the meeting, Senators passed changes to the Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee’s legal code, the Women’s Committee presented plans to offer regular self-defense classes in the near future and executive officers celebrated the implementation of Proposition 30.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48718\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48718\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-08/senate-discusses-investments-debates-financial-affairs/","id":3098,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3097,3096,3095],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Associated Students Discuss Hurricane Relief, I.V.

The Senate also accepted Off-Campus Senator Cory Wheeler’s resignation and decided who would be responsible for finding his replacement.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Andrew Soriano proposed post-Hurricane Sandy clean-up efforts, emphasizing the gravity of the disastrous situation and citing similar fundraising efforts.</p>\n<p>“The hurricane pretty much devastated the East Coast,” Soriano said. “I know in the past we have organized efforts with things like Hurricane Katrina.”</p>\n<p>Soriano’s idea was met with support and enthusiasm. Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia suggested a blood drive to help aide shortages in areas heavily affected by the storm.</p>\n<p>“There has been a blood shortage because of so many people being wounded … blood banks have been affected as well,” Segovia said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Segovia also encouraged a partnership with Red Cross to donate blood.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Miya Sommers said the United States was not the only country to take a beating from Sandy, reminding the Senate that some other affected countries do not have the infrastructure to bounce back quickly after such a storm.</p>\n<p>Another proposed project dealt with Isla Vista’s lack of appropriate lighting. Off-Campus Senators Alex Choate and Kaitlyn Christianson are working on a resolution to make I.V. brighter, which they defended at the meeting. Christianson said the resolution, which entails filing a work order for each defunct bulb in I.V., is a simple solution to a pressing issue.</p>\n<p>“[This is] something that we’ve needed for years and it [has] not [been] able to get done because of funding,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the meeting, Senators discussed Proposition 30 and the consequences that would accompany its failure, as they have at every meeting for the past few weeks. There will be continued efforts to advocate Proposition 30’s significance to the student body before Tuesday’s election.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48630\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48630\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-05/students-discuss-hurricane-relief-iv-lighting/","id":3102,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3101,3100,3099],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/183"}},"__N_SSG":true}
