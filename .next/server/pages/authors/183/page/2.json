Their meeting lasted approximately two-and-a-half hours, with the longest discussion surrounding a debate over whether to approve the appointment of Aidan Brorsen to the position of chair of A.S. Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>Before officially swearing in the new senators, however, outgoing senators offered reflections on their terms and gave advice to the incoming team.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson said she urges new senators to strive for a productive term in office.</p>\n<p>“Don’t let yourself get to where we are right now. Don’t let yourself get to a year from now, and not feel like you’ve done anything on Senate,” Christianson said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Taryn Sanders stressed the importance of building relationships with fellow student policymakers outside of the Senate meetings, so as to maintain a healthy work environment. Sanders said fostering such bonds and friendships within A.S. can potentially help members during conflicts or issues.</p>\n<p>“Have parties together. Socialize together. Hang out together outside of Senate,” Sanders said. “Make some personal connections so that you aren’t yelling at someone in Senate that you hate because you don’t even know them.”</p>\n<p>According to Off-campus Senator Navkiran Kaur, the incoming Senate should strive to go beyond requirements detailed by the legal code and reach out to groups or communities who may not already have a presence on the Senate.</p>\n<p>“In your legal code, actually, it does state that you must go to organizations that you do not identify with — at least one meeting or event,” Kaur said. “I really, really, really do encourage that you do that extensively and beyond what your legal code dictates, making sure that you reach out to communities that you do not identify with, and that you are educating yourself and learning in this process as well.”</p>\n<p>Regarding the debate surrounding Brorsen’s appointment as chair of Committee on Committees, outgoing University Owned Senator Miya Sommers said she felt the appointment process lacked clarity.</p>\n<p>Sommers said she was unsure of why the opposing candidate Zach Goulhiane was not chosen during public forum and she questioned the basis behind Brorsen’s appointment.</p>\n<p>“I do not believe that he was accepted for his interview. I believe that he was accepted for external reasons,” Sommers said. “I think the external appointments need to be more closely looked at.”</p>\n<p>Newly sworn-in A.S. President Jonathan Abboud said Brorsen’s appointment over Goulhiane’s was due to the other candidate’s potential for placement in other A.S. positions.</p>\n<p>“Zach is being highly considered, basically selected, for other positions within the association,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>After much deliberation, the decision to confirm the appointment was tabled for one week, providing senators with more time to obtain information regarding each of the candidates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"580960544\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51570\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new-2013-14-a-s-executive-officers-assume-roles/senate_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369269354\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"24\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51571\" alt=\"Senate_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_Vandenbelt-250x166.jpg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Marisela Marquez addresses A.S.

Senate members and executive officers for next year. Both the new Senate and new executive board consist largely of Open People’s Party candidates, as all executives for the 2013-2014 school year are former O.P.P. candidates. Jonathan Abboud was sworn into the position of President, while Kyley Scarlet was sworn in as Internal Vice President and Alex Moore was sworn in as External Vice President of Local Affairs. Alex Choate officially took the seat of External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and Kristian Whittaker was sworn in as Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>In regards to executive reports, Haile spoke first and named specific entities and individual whom he said he was targeted and attacked by — including Rabbi Evan Goodman, President-elect Jonathan Abboud, Off-Campus Senator Alessandra Cianni and the <i>Daily Nexus,</i> amongst others.</p>\n<p>According to Haile, many of the allegations levied against him were a result of racial prejudice, particularly ones surrounding divestment meetings, in which he and other executives voiced their opinions. The Student Advocate General said he was accused by Rabbi Goodman of anti-Semitism, who Haile said ignored the similar opinions voiced by other speakers.</p>\n<p>“Given that the content of my speech was quite similar to at least 100 people who spoke during public forum, it’s interesting that the Rabbi chose to come after me and nobody else, at least to the extent that he did,” Haile said. “I believe race was a big factor in his treatment of me … I am an African man, a black man. I say that because the Rabbi knows nothing about me, aside from what I look like and what I said during public forum and my Exec report.”</p>\n<p>Haile also mentioned a <i>Daily Nexus</i> endorsement article for this year’s A.S. elections, which was published on April 22 and “called to question his ability to act as the nonpartisan resource that the OSA is expected to be.”</p>\n<p>“Given your history of publishing anti-Black Op-eds and other commentaries, I am not surprised,” Haile said. “I did not know racism and white supremacy were partisan issues for me to stay out of.”</p>\n<p>Later in the report, Haile highlighted “remarkable feats” met by the SAG Office during his term, describing his office as a “strong and beautiful team” that has counseled and assisted students through academic troubles, legal issues and housing issues, amongst other matters.</p>\n<p>“We helped and counseled hundreds of students regarding many issues they were struggling with ranging from being kicked out of school, cancellation of housing contracts, family problems, targeted treatment by police and much more,” Haile said.</p>\n<p>He also applauded the office’s participation in on-campus organizational efforts and its collaboration with the Black Student Union.</p>\n<p>Following Haile’s report was EVPSA Houssain’s speech, which was supportive of Haile’s statements and also said this school year included a number of positive efforts and changes.</p>\n<p>In his address, Houssain mentioned the success of passing Proposition 30, the record number of students registered to vote and a campaign addressing the corruption surrounding the prison industrial complex in California as some of the most successful accomplishments of his term.</p>\n<p>EVPLA Siordia spoke after Houssain and said there were over 30 initiatives launched through the EVPLA office this year. Siordia said his experience was rewarding, as it also helped him shape his sense of self.</p>\n<p>“How can I take one of the most cherished experiences of my life and describe it with words?” Siordia asked. “I truly feel like I’m losing the central and primary part of my identity. But even though this part of my life will no longer exist, I will still carry all of the incredible lessons that I’ve learned with me.”</p>\n<p>IVP Segovia spoke next, as she said her time in office allowed her to realize that she could not let others define her own personal identity.</p>\n<p>“You are your own worst enemy — the only person who knows you better than any one else ever will,” Segovia said. “You have the freedom to find yourself, think for yourself, and stay true to who you think you are.”</p>\n<p>Finally, President Armen delivered her executive report, also noting her negative experiences in A.S. She said she was unfairly attacked throughout her time at UCSB, and she urged listeners to treat each other with respect.</p>\n<p>“One of the most radical things that people can do is actually to have love in everything that they do,” Armen said. “I have, in the face of all of this, still shown love and respect and waved and smiled at every person that I met here, you know, and it’s been difficult. But, I have to say it’s all been working.”</p>\n<p>Armen said she did not believe political parties dominated A.S. but rather, that unhealthy power dynamics have weakened the organization.</p>\n<p>“While the party politics seem like the overrun A.S. — no,” Armen said. “We have power issues in this place that need to be addressed. We have one party that has won for six years 90 percent of the seats…If you want to look at things nationally, and you were to compare the systems, you would say there’s a problem, too.”</p>\n<p>Armen concluded her report with a spoken word piece that she wrote during her campaign for election last year. The piece focused on justice and humanity.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want no movement, if there ain’t no humanity,” Armen said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51559\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1608402219\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51558\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51559\" data-attachment-id=\"51559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/a-s-execs-give-reports-new-officers-sworn-in-2/senate_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369266755\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abboud gets sworn in as the new  2013-2014 Associated Students President.

UCen changes also rank high on Abboud’s to-do list, as he said his presidential term will mark a window of opportunity for student-led renovations to the campus building, which would be completed through revenue-generating solutions.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Abboud said he hopes to increase the amount of control A.S. student officials have over the expansion of A.S. staff, ensuring staff salaries do not unfairly deplete student funds.</p>\n<p>“We’re in the beginning stages of thinking about how we can do it so that any decision to hire new staff has to be approved by the Senate,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p><strong><img data-attachment-id=\"51498\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-21/a-s-to-swear-in-next-years-executive-officers/kyley-scarlet/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Kyley Scarlet\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-51498 alignleft\" alt=\"Kyley Scarlet\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kyley-Scarlet.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Internal Vice President – IVP </strong></p>\n<p>Internal Vice President-Elect Kyley Scarlet said her top priorities for her term as IVP are more effective training and guiding of Senators, as well as improving publicity relations for A.S.

Moore also said he will advocate “Keep It Local” campaigns for Halloween and Deltopia, and added that he will institute student lobbying efforts at the local, countywide level.</p>\n<p>“I talked about maybe having student lobby type conference things, where students actually speak to the Board of Supervisors and students express their concerns directly to them,” Moore said.</p>\n<p>These efforts could tackle Isla Vista’s most controversial issues and laws, such as the Social Host Ordinance. The Bluelight application being spearheaded by Moore allows users to push a button to send an emergency warning, and it automatically sends user location and personal information to a friend or to 911. The device has already proven successful, reducing police response time by as much as 44 percent at other campuses, Moore said.</p>\n<p><strong><img data-attachment-id=\"51500\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-21/a-s-to-swear-in-next-years-executive-officers/alexandria-choate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"150,150\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Alexandria Choate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-51500 alignleft\" alt=\"Alexandria Choate\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Alexandria-Choate.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">External Vice President of Statewide Affairs – EVPSA </strong></p>\n<p>Alex Choate said she plans to reach out to a greater, more diverse portion of students as External Vice President of Statewide Affairs.

Senators proved responsive to students who lobbied at the meeting, adhering more closely to requests from student groups who spoke in public forum such as Queer Commission and Womyn’s Commission.</p>\n<p>For most allocations, Senators allocated an amount of the funds between the proposed budgets of A.S. Finance Board and the A.S. President. However, the organizations S.C.O.R.E., S.I.R.R.C., Student Lobby and Human Rights Board were given more money than either Finance Board or the President suggested.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed revisions to the A.S. Election Code, as well as the legality of Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia’s interpretation of the legal code at last week’s meeting regarding divestment from companies that profit from the military occupation of Palestine.</p>\n<p>Womyn’s Commission Co-Chair Mariam Agazaryan addressed public forum in defense of the organization’s requested allocations. Agazaryan said she was disheartened by the substantial cuts made to all of the Boards, Committees, and Commissions as opposed to other entities in light of the budget restrictions.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a little bit ridiculous that BCCs are bearing the brunt of it,” Agazaryan said. “Senate, you hold a lot of power, but again, the BCCs is where it’s at.”</p>\n<p>Queer commission member James Neally said the need for increased LGBTQ education within the UCSB community is critical, especially in regards to the current campus climate.</p>\n<p>“Everything that Queer Commission does is very important to all the students here,” Neally said. “Even today there’s problems with people on our campus and a lot of education that needs to be done still.”</p>\n<p>Representatives from both Queer Commission and Womyn’s commission pointed towards the annual publication of Herstory! — a magazine that aims to give a voice to underrepresented minorities — as an important budget item.</p>\n<p>Representatives from various other organizations also presented in defense of their budget requests during public forum including the Student Commission on Racial Equality, Rally Commission, the Offices of the Student Advocate General and the External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and Take Back the Night.</p>\n<p>Senators spent several hours discussing each item on the budget individually, and eventually reached a consensus, which was approved at 6:02 a.m.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Senators also touched on the AFSCME protest of the Regents Meeting, the Elections code, and whether or not Segovia had acted in accordance with the legal code when she decided that 12 votes did not constitute enough of a majority for last week’s divestment resolution to pass. Segovia asserted that although she may have been mistaken in her logic, she had been correct in her interpretation.</p>\n<p>A motion was made to officially reconsider the chair’s decision, but the action was voted down.</p>\n<h6><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"166327550\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51439\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51436\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/panel-debates-ethics-of-drone-warfare-at-campbell-hall/web_senate_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51436\" alt=\"WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WEB_Senate_Vandenbelt.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></h6>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>During Wednesday’s Associated Students meeting, senators took 12 hours to vote on the A.S. budget for the 2013-2014 school year.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/a-s-senate-approves-budget-for-2013-2014/","id":3079,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3078,3077,3076],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Under Legal code, a simple majority is 50 percent of Senators plus one, not counting abstentions — meaning that passage of the resolution would have required a “yes” vote from 13 of the 23 senators present (rounded up from 12.5).</p>\n<p>Authors of the resolution said they sought to incorporate critiques of the original document — “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid” — in their revisions and hoped that Senators would note the changes. University Owned Senator Miya Sommers said she believed the revisions made the resolution more neutral and less divisively worded.</p>\n<p>“This resolution — there’s a lot of changes into it. We definitely took all of the criticisms,” Sommers said. “This resolution is not taking sides; it’s not saying that we have an idea of what we want to happen around the issue. We, instead, are just asking for our school to not be involved.”</p>\n<p>Student sponsor and third-year political science major Katlen Abuata said the resolution did not intend to attack Israel itself but instead aimed to pressure the state to end certain policies.</p>\n<p>“What we’re doing here is not questioning the existence of Israel because we don’t want to do that at all. We don’t delegitimize the state of Israel,” Abuata said. “We are asking you to recognize that there are human rights violations and that there are students on this campus who feel uncomfortable with that.”</p>\n<p>Anti-divestment speaker Liran Braude said he did not believe the underlying intent of the resolution changed with the revisions.</p>\n<p>“This has become more than a little bit ridiculous,” Braude said. “The entire student body’s resources, time and money are being spent so that one group can attempt to force their own personal political complaint on the Senate, at the expense of another group on campus. The bottom line of this resolution has not changed at all.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Ben Green said he rejected the idea of the resolution’s “neutrality.”</p>\n<p>“It keeps being said that this isn’t taking a stance, and that this won’t be alienating people,” Green said. “It creates a controversial issue and a climate where people don’t feel safe.”</p>\n<p>Senators also touched on a number of arguments discussed in previous meetings such as impact of the decision on the campus climate, which communities would feel marginalized and what financial impact the resolution would have on UCSB. Following a heated debate over what constitutes a majority vote, Segovia announced her decision in tears, apologizing to anyone who would feel hurt by the defeat.</p>\n<p>In response, A.S. President Sophia Armen encouraged students to maintain civility when deliberating on sensitive issues.</p>\n<p>“We’re all still people, we’re all still students and it’s disheartening to see how much anger, how much pain, can be inflicted on each other,” Armen said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, Senators also began a discussion on the budget for the 2013-2014 school year, which was tabled last week due to a controversial vote on the divestment issue and was supposed to be finalized by the end of Wednesday’s meeting. Members of the Queer Commission, Human Rights Board, A.S. Food Bank and other groups presented defenses for funding requests, but the Senate ultimately decided to extend the budget deadline for one more week in order to more thoroughly examine each Board, Committee and Commission request.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1649098816\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51321\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51323\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/a-s-senate-meeting-fails-to-pass-revised-divestment-resolution-with-close-votes/as_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_Vandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51323\" alt=\"AS_Vandenbelt\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AS_Vandenbelt.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A.S.

The Senate was then unable to proceed with the planned discussion of next year’s budget due to the abrupt departure of four senators, which left the Senate without the requisite attendance to vote on agenda items.<br>\nThe meeting was held in the Hub rather than in the Flying A room in order to accommodate the expected audience. While the number of students present did not match the hundreds that attended the previous two meetings dealing with divestment, audience turnout was still much higher than most meetings.<br>\nThe title of the resolution was changed from “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid” to “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from the Military Occupation of Palestine” in an effort to make the rhetoric more neutral.<br>\nCianni said she motioned to remove the agenda item due to the fact that the Senate had already spent two meetings discussing the issue of divestment, and the primary purpose of last night’s meeting was to solicit input from A.S. Boards, Committees and Commissions groups on next year’s budget allocations.<br>\nThe dismissal of the resolution left many planned student speakers unable to address the Senate in Public Forum. Pro-divestment audience member and student sponsor of the resolution Katlen Abuata said she felt the removal of the resolution discounted the work Abuata and others had done to take criticisms into account.<br>\n“I think that Senate perpetually silences us as students,” Abuata said. “I think that since we worked hard enough to put up another resolution, we took all of the critiques and concerns that the opposition had in regards to our resolution, and we changed it. We came in here with an open mind willing to work on the resolution in any way possible, and instead they silenced us and they just completely took the resolution off the table without discussion or even thought.”<br>\nAnti-divestment audience member Jake Speyer, who had meant to speak during public forum, supported the senate’s decision.<br>\n“Coming into this meeting, there was a lot of hesitation — I think from both sides, especially since in dealing with the divestment last week, we thought … that divestment was dealt with and that we would be able to work on pro-peace initiatives for the rest of the year,” Speyer said. “I personally am satisfied with the decision of the senate … If [the resolution] was simply brought up, and we decided that our senate doesn’t want to hear it, then that’s absolutely wrong … but it was already dealt with … the revisions that were brought up were also brought up in the last meeting.”<br>\nAfter Cianni’s motion passed, University Owned Senator Miya Sommers motioned to remove On-campus Senator Kevin Rudolph from the meeting, citing his failure to update his office hours on the Senate website as irresponsible. Sommers’ motion failed, at which point she and three other Senators left the meeting. Their absence left the Senate without quorum and unable to vote on other matters, such as the budget. Public Forum continued nonetheless.<br>\nA.S. President Sophia Armen addressed the Senate in Public Forum, expressing her frustration at what had occurred, especially noting what she considered a political use of the budget to undermine the divestment resolution.<br>\n“You all have literally two weeks to look at this budget and I am very frustrated by you using it politically,” Armen said. “This is the entire Association’s futurec … and now what I’m now actually afraid of, is if the possibility that something else could happen next week, we won’t be able to have the discussion that we could have had this week.”<br>\nAssociate Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said senators need to treat each other with kindness and respect.<br>\n“If there is one thing that truly, truly pains me … is to have to watch young people like yourselves be really so mean and so cruel to one each other,” Jones said. “This level of cruelty knows no party lines, no political lines, no religious affiliation, no cultural, ethnic or gender orientation, or any other form of categorization. It is universal, it is coming from all sides, it is multidirectional. And it is truly heartbreaking to watch when you don’t have to do that. You don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>Senators were unable to officially adjourn due to the lack of quorum. Discussion on the budget will continue next week.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/senate-dismisses-revised-divestment-resolution/","id":3076,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3075,3074,3073],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The ongoing elections process, along with some recently contentious meetings, have contributed to increasingly negative feelings between senators and led speakers to address events and actions that bothered them within the Senate.</p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Kevin Rudolph read a letter during the public forum condemning the actions of another unnamed senator, citing tweets in which the senator allegedly spoke disrespectfully toward colleagues and accused the senator of missing last week’s meeting for campaigning reasons.</p>\n<p>“Senators attacking other senators and posting public statements during the Senate meetings that both undermine and attack the process … should be deemed as unacceptable behavior for an elected official of the student body,” Rudolph said. “I ask if this behavior not changed, that the Internal Vice President puts the Senator’s removal on the agenda.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Kaitlyn Christianson addressed the public forum as well, and said such accusations reflected party politics and should be let go.</p>\n<p>“I just feel like we focus on petty stuff so much … and I really hope that we can just move on,” Christianson said. “This is obviously about parties and it happens on both sides, and it’s really stupid.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia also spoke during the public forum and aimed to clear up some accusations that have been made toward executive officers, asking that the senators respect the effort that she puts into her job.</p>\n<p>“Accusations [including] how execs have been spending their money or that the association is corrupt, I personally … hate it, actually, when people are making allegations like that … because I feel like it is undermining the work of the people that have actually been doing really great things,” Segovia said. “I just hold myself to a higher standard, and I hope you all hold me to that standard, too. I hope I’m not failing you.”</p>\n<p>After the tense public forum was over, the senators passed a resolution supporting A.S. President Sophia Armen’s invitation to the UC Regents to hold a regent meeting on the UCSB campus, as well as a resolution to divest from companies that profit from the prison industrial complex.</p>\n<p>Though there was some confusion around a statistic that one senator argued was misleading in the prison divestment resolution, the senators ultimately passed the resolution unanimously.</p>\n<p>On-campus Senator Miya Sommers, who contributed to the resolution, said the prison industrial complex contributes to institutional racism within our society.</p>\n<p>“This is just really important because, again, the prison industrial complex is very disastrous for the functioning of our society,” Sommers said. “People of color are over-incarcerated … and this is, sort of, a new form of racial prejudice.”</p>\n<p>Student sponsor third-year Middle Eastern studies major Hani Tajsar said the incarceration statistics themselves show the unjust incrimination of people of color.</p>\n<p>“White people are three times more likely to have drugs on them, or to be using illegal drugs … but people of color, specifically black people, are four times more likely to be searched on suspicion of having drugs,” Tajsar said. “I think the statistics speak for themselves.”</p>\n<p>During next week’s meeting, the senators will consider the Finance Board budget for the 2013-14 school year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"876185273\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51071\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51069\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/alumni-to-bring-local-flavor-to-all-gaucho-reunion/as_petervandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_PeterVandenbelt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-51069\" alt=\"AS_PeterVandenbelt\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_PeterVandenbelt-250x166.jpeg?resize=250%2C166\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>PETER VANDENBELT / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>During Wednesday’s public forum, A.S.

Additionally, Collegiate Senator Adrian Orozco announced his resignation, citing career-related commitments.</p>\n<p>In contrast to last week’s heavily attended and contentious meeting, Wednesday’s meeting saw a much smaller turnout and a significantly shorter list of speakers at Public Forum. Several Senators were absent, and opted to send proxies instead.</p>\n<p>The first speakers in public forum — Mark Hartell and Rebecca Metzger of the UCSB Library staff — informed the Senate on the status of upcoming renovations to Davidson Library that are currently scheduled to last two and a half years. Hartell said the changes have been delayed for too long, and are just barely coming to life after decades of planning.</p>\n<p>“In terms of construction, nothing has happened in 35 years … It’s been many, many years in the planning, but it really is going to start,” Hartell said. “In a nutshell, the project is scheduled to run for two and a half years.”</p>\n<p>Swipes For The Homeless representatives Ali Guthy and Shannon Mirshokri also spoke during Public Forum, requesting the Senate’s support in expanding their program. Swipes For The Homeless is a program in which students can donate their unused dining commons meals to a local homeless shelter.</p>\n<p>“This is a really amazing program, and we really hope that you all will support our endeavor,” Guthy said. “This has to occur in a dialogue with administration, which currently we’re having trouble starting … we just really need more support.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja shared her thoughts on the Senate’s decision to refrain from passing last week’s divestment resolution. Ahuja said the Senate did not adequately listen to her and other individuals’ arguments in support of the resolution.</p>\n<p>“I am disgusted by this space because not only did you let bureaucratic and political crap get in the way of passing this resolution, but you also didn’t take into account the fact that over 30 organizations on this campus sponsored this resolution,” Ahuja said. “I think you need to take a look at yourself as Senate and look at the people around you … people should be aware of the privileges they do have.”</p>\n<p>Finance Board Chair Raul Martinez presented a seminar regarding a potential project aimed at teaching students important financial life skills. Additionally, Katlen Abu Ata asked senators to be aware of the unjust American prison system especially in light of a recent gang injunction proposed by the Santa Barbara County Chief of Police.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of Public Forum, Collegiate Senator Adrian Orozco officially announced his resignation from the post, in the most recent of a string of Senate resignations this year. Orozco said the decision came after considering his priorities in the near future.</p>\n<p>“I have a lot of things to worry about coming up in the next couple of weeks,” Orozco said. “It has to do with career.”</p>\n<p>Later in the meeting, Senators passed a bill changing the recruitment period of Associated Students as well as resolutions supporting Swipes for the Homeless and Martinez’s finance seminar.</p>\n<p>Senators tabled a resolution entitled “Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit form the Prison Industrial Complex” for one week, at the request of resolution author Navkiran Kaur, who was not present at the meeting. They also created ad hoc committees to deal with certain issues facing the Isla Vista community, namely the sobering center and unsafe balconies.</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator Kyley Scarlet proposed an ad hoc committee to look into possible solutions for the balcony problem in order to prevent future incidents similar to the balcony that fell Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“For those of you who don’t know, 6643 [Del Playa] — their balcony collapsed,” Scarlet said. “When things like this happen, the liability falls completely on the people who live there … [The ad hoc will be] kind of figuring out what we can do about that.”</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s meeting adjourned at 12:58 a.m. Next week, A.S. Senators will address the prison divestment resolution in addition to other issues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1144913256\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50959\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50960\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-s-senates-meeting-discusses-library-renovations-nonprofits-divestment-resolution/for-04-18-2013_senate_file-photo-4-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366225829\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"120\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"for 04.18.2013_senate_FILE PHOTO-4-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50960\" alt=\"for 04.18.2013_senate_FILE PHOTO-4-2\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2-250x133.jpg?resize=250%2C133\" width=\"250\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/for-04.18.2013_senate_FILE-PHOTO-4-2.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>DAILY NEXUS FILE PHOTO</h6>\n<h6>Senators at the A.S.Senate meeting last Wednesday considered the status of the Davidson Library renovation project, among other topics.

The Student Advocate General assists students who are charged with violating the University Code of Student Conduct, and students charged of such misconduct are expected to undergo.</p>\n<p>When asked their opinion on the new Conduct Board that aims to judge and potentially punish student groups, both candidates said students should have active involvement in this legal process.</p>\n<p>Third-year history of public policy major Villela said he would make sure to keep a constant presence at the Conduct Board meetings, despite some logistical obstacles to this goal.</p>\n<p>“As far as Conduct Boards, I feel that it is still my space to go and represent these students, so no matter what, I’m still going to be there,” Villela said. “Even though I’m not allowed to say anything, I’m still allowed to ask for time-outs.”</p>\n<p>Whittaker argued that the idea of a conduct board was unfair to students, and said he would fight to gain a greater student voice in this matter.</p>\n<p>“I feel that it’s personally attacking the students on an underhanded level,” Whittaker said. “I have found that most student conduct cases are mistakes — mistakes that most students overlook or just simply forgot … I feel like the Student Advocate General needs a push for an actual say — to actually represent the students in these cases with an actual voice.”</p>\n<p>In regards to past student advocacy efforts, Whittaker said his time on the A.S. Senate and his involvement in creating a group project seeking student input are two experiences that directly qualify him for the position. Whittaker said he plans to change the usual procedures for the position, making a greater effort to assist student defendants.</p>\n<p>“Myself and the four other on-campus legislative council members have definitely felt that our constituents … were not directly represented. However, it was our fault … we were not going to these residence halls as we should have been,” Whittaker said. “Thus we created our group project … we did not wait for them to come to us — we went to them.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Villela mentioned his role in starting Educational Opportunity Program Step Up[[ok]], which raised over $20,000 for the Educational Opportunity Program. Introducing the new program required a sense of initiative that Villela said he would bring to the role of Student Advocate General.</p>\n<p>“EOP, as many of you know, are for first-generation students … EOP got hit hard, just as a lot of things on this campus got hit hard, and what happened was — I was a part of a two-week program, and what they were going to do was to cut it down to five days,” Villela said. “So what I did, during my first year along with 10 other people, was to create this program called Step Up.”</p>\n<p>Since the Student Advocate General must regularly resolve student conflicts on a large scale, candidates were also questioned on their ability to come to an effective and fair decision.</p>\n<p>Villela said his time as a Resident Assistant has given him first-hand experience in dealing with a variety of personal conflicts between students, and Villela said he plans to provide students undergoing the university judicial process with a “safe, confidential space.”</p>\n<p>“As a Resident Assistant, I deal with conflicts all the time. We had a very conservative [student], and then we had a student that was a part of the LGBT community, and then a student that was not supportive of that…it was a space for me…to figure out how to best work with each other,” Villela said.</p>\n<p>Whittaker, on the other hand, cited a personal experience when he had had to deal with his own roommate’s misconceptions about his queer identity.</p>\n<p>“In mid-winter, I got a new roommate and I hadn’t met this person before, so they came in and I guess the roommate didn’t know that I was a queer person … I guess that he didn’t feel too comfortable with me and my sexuality,” Whittaker said. “To be honest, a lot of his complications with me were misconceptions about the queer community … so it definitely just came through education, definitely letting him know a lot of the things he believed about queer people were false.”</p>\n<p>When asked how they would maintain truthfulness and accountability within the Office of the Student Advocate General, Villela said that he would be sure to remain nonpartisan and create a Facebook page for the office to reach out to students. Whittaker said he would create an ‘advocacy agenda’ by the fifth week of Fall 2013, which would expand analytical research in the office.</p>\n<p>In their final statements, both candidates stressed their commitment to the student body. Whittaker said he wants to push for more clarified definitions of policies for students, whereas Villela said he would ensure that the Office of Student Advocacy is a safe place for any student who needs it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1822965026\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50949\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50952\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/candidates-discuss-student-conduct-compete-for-advocate-general-position/as-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1366215104\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"117\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13 (12)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?fit=800%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50952\" alt=\"AS debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13 (12)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12-250x133.jpg?resize=250%2C133\" width=\"250\" height=\"133\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS-debate_alexgonzalez_4-18-13-12.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>ALEX GONZALES / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6> Student Advocate General candidates debated issues related to judicial affairs on campus yesterday.

Several attendees spoke both in opposition and in support of the resolution, which requested that A.S. divest from companies, such as Hewlett-Packard, that “profit” from the “military occupation of Palestine.” The meeting also included resolutions aiming to condemn “Islamophobic hate speech” on campus.</p>\n<p>In regards to the resolution entitled “A Resolution to Divest from Companies that Profit from Apartheid,” 11 senators voted against the resolution and 10 senators voted in support of it, while one senator abstained. The resolution, therefore, did not achieve the required two-thirds majority, and was not passed. The meeting adjourned at 7:55 a.m., after over 13 hours of deliberation.</p>\n<p>The aisle dividing the chairs into two seating sections at Corwin Pavilion marked a clear boundary between each side of the debate, with pro-divestment advocates on the left and anti-divestment advocates on the right. Participants demonstrated incredible passion throughout the entire meeting, as evidenced by the multiple instances of tense voices and tears.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator Taryn Sanders preceded the debate with an appeal to the audience to remain respectful of the different perspectives.</p>\n<p>“I hope that we can … realize that there are passions on both sides of, in particular, the divestment issue — pro and con — and to address people in that way,” Sanders said. “Know that you’re not the only one that has passion about this. You’re not the only one that has an interest in this subject. In fact, there is another side to it, and to please see things from that side, and to address people in a mature way.”</p>\n<p>The meeting first began at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, marking the second meeting that included discussion of the divestment resolution. As the issue had already been discussed in much depth at last week’s meeting, speakers had the opportunity to reflect upon last week’s discussion and respond to some of the previous arguments. Adeel Lakhani, External Co-Chair at UCSB Academic Affairs Board, urged senators to be critical of the information being presented, such as when some speakers said Israel was not the only country in the region violating human rights.</p>\n<p>This second meeting also attracted many community members from outside of UCSB. The Santa Barbara chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace presented multiple speakers who, although personally identifying as Jewish, supported the divestment resolution. Rand Clark of Jewish Voice for Peace said being of the Jewish faith does not necessarily mean one is supportive of the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>“To be Jewish does not automatically make one a blind supporter of Israel — right or wrong,” Clark said. “A vote in favor of divestment says nothing about one’s attitude towards Jews … A little bit of discomfort is a small price to pay on the path to justice.”</p>\n<p>Anti-divestment speakers, however, vehemently denied that the divestment resolution would be a step toward justice. UCSB student Jonathan Lebo insisted the legislation would not encourage a peaceful solution.</p>\n<p>“The bill before you tonight is not about fostering peace,” Lebo said. “It will do nothing to end the centuries-old conflict between Jews and their Arab neighbors. The real [impact] of this bill is to deny the people of Israel the right to their homeland … The charges against Israel make no mention of the dire circumstances Israel faces.”</p>\n<p>Many anti-divestment speakers also questioned if Israel is actually breaking international law or committing human rights violations, as the resolution suggests.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, speakers representing both sides of the issue spoke about the effects the resolution would have on campus climate. Some anti-divestment speakers argued the divestment resolution was divisive and would hurt the general climate of UCSB, while some pro-divestment speakers argued it would actually unify the campus, as shown by the numerous student groups in support of its passage.</p>\n<p>Sabreen Shalabi of UC Irvine, who authored a similar resolution that passed unanimously at UCI, not only insisted campus climate at her school had not changed after passing the resolution, but also said past issues of similar importance have always faced such strong resistance.</p>\n<p>“The passing of the divestment resolution did not cause our campus to deteriorate in any way,” Shalabi said. “No issue is going to be agreed upon unanimously. No issue has ever been agreed upon unanimously … senators here today, sitting around, having this power to vote, this privilege to vote. Would you have voted for civil rights? Would you have voted to divest in Apartheid South Africa? That is the kind of decision that you are making today.”</p>\n<p>Despite such claims, many Jewish students said they felt campus climate had already changed. UCSB student Nathan Koreie felt so strongly about the degradation of the campus climate that he announced his official withdrawal from the university.</p>\n<p>“I was intimidated while in the A.S. Senate office. A student was spit on while on her way to class. Someone let the air out of my bike tires while at the A.S. Senate office, and a friend of mine was even denied service at the book store, all for opposing this resolution,” Koreie said. “As of this morning … I withdrew from UCSB … I genuinely feel like I have been left with no other choice.”</p>\n<p>First-hand accounts of life in Israel contradicted each other over whether or not Israel did engage in apartheid practices. Mohamed Hafez, a UCSB alumnus who spent time working for peace in the West Bank, insisted that citizens had different rights based on race. On the other hand, UCSB student Guy Singer, who lived in Israel for 11 years, insisted that Arab Israelis were not discriminated against, as there are Arab Israelis in positions of power and even Arab Israelis who are celebrities.</p>\n<p>Both parties called into question the reliability of sources being used for factual evidence, asserting bias within the sources. The integrity of many institutions was debated — including the United Nations, Amnesty International, the American government and others.</p>\n<p>At one point, the use of Miss Israel 2013’s African heritage to show Israel’s commitment to diversity elicited intensely critical responses. On-campus Senator Navkiran Kaur strongly opposed this example, explaining it to be offensive and an objectification of women of color.</p>\n<p>“I do not appreciate a woman of color’s body being objectified, or hyper-sexualized or tokenized in this space,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>In some final presentations regarding the resolution, both sides issued their opinions on the word apartheid itself. Anti-divestment representative Liran Braude, who has both lived in South Africa during apartheid and then in Israel as a soldier, disagreed with the word’s place in the legislation.</p>\n<p>“To compare [South Africa and Israel] is an insult of the highest order — not only to Jews and Israelis, but mostly to the black South Africans that actually suffered of apartheid,” Braude said.</p>\n<p>Hani Tajsar, student sponsor and representative of the pro-divestment stance, denied that naming Israel an apartheid state equated it to South Africa.</p>\n<p>“Apartheid does not mean that Israel is acting in the same way as South Africa,” Tajsar said. “South Africa and Israel have only one similarity: both were born out of imperialism and colonialism … As students at this university, we have a complicit involvement in the occupation of Palestine through our investments in these companies.”</p>\n<p>Katlen Abuata, Tajsar’s co-sponsor, added her own personal appeal to argument for divestment.</p>\n<p>“I do not want to pay into a system that has removed my father from his homeland,” Abuata said.</p>\n<p>Deliberation within the senate revisited many of the arguments that had already been introduced. Senators read different definitions of apartheid and debated whether or not voting on the bill was an act of neutrality and whether or not it would have tangible results in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>The student legislators also discussed the role of the investments in enabling human rights violations, and whether or not it was acceptable for student money to be funneled toward that cause. There was also debate over the intentions of the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and its connection with the resolution. After the deliberation, which included a long discussion on whether the resolution needed a simple majority or a two-thirds majority, the senators decided to cast a secret vote, which resulted in a defeat of the proposed resolution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"543296520\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50820\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50817\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/calpirg-protests-obamas-potential-student-loan-interest-rate-hike/divestment_tiana/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"iPhone 4S\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1365666521\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"4.28\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.05\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Divestment_Tiana\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50817\" alt=\"Divestment_Tiana\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Divestment_Tiana.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>TIANA MILLER-LEONARD / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A.S.

Academic Affairs Board External Co-Chair Adeel Lakhani said the senate’s responsibility is to actively and critically analyze all perspectives when considering whether or not to pass the resolution, entitled “A Resolution to Divest From Companies that Profit From Apartheid.”<br>\n“Active pursuit of understanding is different from being served arguments or ideology,” Lakhani said. “My main point was that consideration of this resolution should be limited to consideration of this resolution … this resolution does not address how to finally address all parties’ concerns but this resolution does make clear that all parties’ concerns should be respected.”<br>\nStudent Rosina Saeed, a supporter of divestment, said discrimination plays a large role in human rights violations occurring in Palestine.<br>\n“I would like to address apartheid,” Saeed said. “My definition of apartheid is racial segregation, simple as that.”<br>\nIn contrast, Jewish Voice for Peace member Rand Clark said support for divestment and anti-Semitism are mutually exclusive sentiments.<br>\n“A vote in favor of divestment says nothing about one’s attitude toward Jews,” Clark said. “A little bit of discomfort is a small price to pay on the path to justice.”<br>\nRabbi Evan Goodman said the resolution has prompted strong reactions from students who feel personally attacked by the university’s potential divestment.<br>\n“One student I spoke to today, I spent a good hour trying to talk him out of withdrawing from the university,” Goodman said.<br>\nAccording to Meggie Le, A.S. President at UCSD, the resolution has been particularly controversial due to the complex and challenging nature of the conflict.<br>\n“Political issues will always be divisive in their nature, but this one is unique in that it is also alienating,” Le said.<br>\nDue to printing constraints, the full story could not be included in today’s issue.

Candidates represented either the Democratic Process Party (DP) or the Open Peoples Party (OPP), and were each allowed a short amount of time to speak.</p>\n<p>In response to a question regarding sexual violence on campus, OPP candidate Andre Theus said, if elected, he would unite the student body with various organizations on campus that address sexual assault issues.</p>\n<p>“Every day there are campus organizations that are working on this issue, but we need to once again unite and create a culture where UCSB is intolerant of sexual violence,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>DP Candidate Anisha Ahuja also said she would strive to allocate more funding for Take Back the Night and other similar committees in addition to prompting the university to address problematic web pages.</p>\n<p>“We also need to take a stand against things like UCSB Confessions and UCSB Hook-Ups that perpetuate the rape culture, and continue to educate people about things like consent and rape culture that are existent in our community,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>When the forum proctor asked candidates their opinion on funding for Greek life, DP Candidate Hani Tajsar said that the Greek community should be required to go through certain training before receiving school funding.</p>\n<p>“One goal that I would fulfill … is to require if Greek life is going to want to get funding from Associated Students that they go through safe-zone training,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>OPP Candidate Corey Lau followed by saying that he did not think funding for Greek life should necessarily be a top priority for A.S.</p>\n<p>“[Funding for Greek life] isn’t always something that should be necessarily pushed for,” Lau said. “We do have other issues on campus.”</p>\n<p>Later in the questioning, candidates were asked about the ways they would promote a healthier environment during large-scale events such as Deltopia and Halloween.</p>\n<p>DP’s Mario Vasquez said a major problem with big Isla Vista events has to do with inaccessibility to large portions of the student body.</p>\n<p>“It’s a travesty that these events aren’t for everyone, they’re not for all students,” Vasquez said. “It’s a travesty that I have homosexual friends, the queer community, that don’t feel safe walking around in pride festival shirts and are susceptible to hate crimes.”</p>\n<p>OPP Candidate Jake Speyer said the school should continue supporting these events but place a larger emphasis on student safety.</p>\n<p>“I feel that we should start by saying that Deltopia and Halloween are traditions that UCSB holds and that we should absolutely not get rid of them,” Speyer said. “But with these traditions comes some things that we need to improve, such as infrastructure, education and awareness and community engagement.”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the forum, candidates were asked to explain why they chose to run with their respective party. According to OPP candidates, their party policy — creating a new platform with every new group of candidates — allows for more original ideas and innovation. Several DP candidates said current DP senators have been more involved in the groups they were part of.</p>\n<p>Members from both parties emphasized their interest in diversity, each side arguing that their party represented every single UCSB student.</p>\n<p>Forums and debates will continue this week and the next. Still to come are the Presidential and Executive Officer debates, as well as the On-Campus Senator forum. Voting begins April 22 on GOLD.</p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the April 10th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50768\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50768\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/a-s-candidate-debates-debut-with-discussion-on-community-issues/","id":3087,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3086,3085,3084],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Divestment Proposal Sparks Nine-Hour Debate, Tabled as Each Side Stands Firm","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Hundreds of students attended Wednesday night’s Associated Students Senate meeting to debate a resolution supporting divestment from companies accused of profiting from “the military occupation of...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Hundreds of students attended Wednesday night’s Associated Students Senate meeting to debate a resolution supporting divestment from companies accused of profiting from “the military occupation of Palestine.”</p>\n<p>Talk of marginalization dominated the nine-hour discussion. Anti-divestment speakers argued that the proposed resolution would marginalize Jewish and Israeli students, while pro-divestment speakers insisted that the current investments have already subjected their community to marginalization. The exceptionally large student turnout forced the meeting to relocate to Corwin Pavilion in order to accommodate everyone, with a majority of the audience remaining at the meeting until adjournment at 5:00 a.m.</p>\n<p>The resolution, titled “A Resolution to Divest From Companies that Profit From Apartheid,” targets seven university-affiliated corporations including Caterpillar, General Electric, Northrop Grumman, Hewlett Packard, Raytheon and Motorola for supporting Israeli military and economic control of Palestinian territories. It calls upon the Associated Students Investment Advisory Committee, the University of California treasury and the UC Regents to divest UC money from each of the companies mentioned in order to defend human rights.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, who co-teaches a course on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with professor Walid Afifi and serves as the executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said the resolution might jeopardize the positive atmosphere that UCSB has created for its Jewish students.</p>\n<p>“We as a community have become a place that is very positive for Jewish students. When a campus like UC Berkeley or UC Santa Cruz is now under federal investigation for anti-Jewish activities … we are the exception,” Goodman said. “We are the exception for Jewish students; we are the exception for Muslim students, and for students of all different backgrounds, so I want to keep it that way.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said this resolution does not merely criticize the Israeli government, but instead attacks the state of Israel itself.</p>\n<p>“There’s one tiny Jewish state in the entire world,” Goodman said. “That the resolution undercuts that — and not something that’s simply critical of the Israeli government — is something that’s antithetical to what I believe in. To single out Israel as an apartheid state — if you can’t understand how that would make a Jewish student feel marginalized, I am flabbergasted.”</p>\n<p>Pro-divestment student and second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja countered the statement.</p>\n<p>“As a student who believes in human rights, I believe that without passing this resolution we are marginalizing students,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>Third-year Hani Tajsar, one of the student sponsors of the resolution and member of Students for Justice in Palestine, rejected the idea that divestment or critique of the government was an attack on the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“I find it very disheartening that I cannot attack the state of Israel without being called an anti-Semite,” Tajsar said.</p>\n<p>Goodman’s co-professor Walid Afifi of the communication department also spoke at the meeting in favor of divestment. Afifi said the Israeli government has broken international laws and should be confronted.</p>\n<p>“In the end, what I think we really need to pay attention to is that we have an occupation … which comes with a rule of law of what is required by the occupier,” Afifi said. “That rule of law has been violated repeatedly in extreme ways, in terms of human rights, in terms of international law.”</p>\n<p>In response to claims that some of companies targeted by the resolution may in fact work to protect Israel, Afifi said he would still support divestment.</p>\n<p>“If companies are both contributing to security and contributing to violations of international law … what I would argue is they should not receive our funding until they stop engaging in the activities that are explicitly violations of international law,” Afifi said.</p>\n<p>Many students in favor of divestment stated that divesting from these companies would not be choosing one side of the conflict but would in fact be an act of neutrality. Some, like student Rosina Saeed, said they were not advising reinvestment in companies that support Palestinian forces, but rather that the resolution advises divestment from the conflict as a whole.</p>\n<p>“By investing in this corporation, we have already taken a stance,” Saeed said. “We are not remaining neutral; we have picked a side.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Jake Speyer argued that divestment would be counterproductive to any positive negotiation that could potentially take place.</p>\n<p>“The situation in the Middle East is complicated, and divesting from American companies, simply because they build bulldozers, is not a step towards peace,” Speyer said. “We can be a model for negotiation on this campus … this resolution has already created a divide.”</p>\n<p>Several students standing against divestment took issue with the idea that the Israeli government violates human rights or international law. Some cited the official position of the United States government as an ally to Israel, quoting and showing clips of President Obama giving his support to the nation. Others, like first-year biology major Guy Singer, drew on personal experience, citing certain memories from his childhood in Israel as an alternative to the image of the country as an oppressive regime.</p>\n<p>“I remember walking to elementary school every single day with a gas mask in my backpack — gas masks required by the government — because there was a threat … I remember going to peace rallies with my mother, begging both sides to lay down arms … I remember the bomb shelters, I remember the sirens, I remember the explosions,” Singer said. “The picture I’d like to show today is a picture of Israel under attack.”</p>\n<p>Third-year Liran Braude contested the resolution by recounting his own experiences as a soldier in the Israeli army.</p>\n<p>“Israel is not comprised of only Jews … Jews and Arab Israelis, not only live together, but they are together in the workplace, and even in the home,” Braude said.</p>\n<p>According to Speyer, Israel promotes freedom in various ways, rather than restricting it, including the country’s support for the LGBTQ community.</p>\n<p>“In 2013, the independent watchdog organization Freedom House named Israel as the only free state in the Middle East … This is the Israel we want to share,” Speyer said. “Tel Aviv is the only place in the Middle East where you will find an annual gay pride parade.”</p>\n<p>The majority of the meeting’s discourse remained civil. However, despite constant efforts by the A.S. senators to create a welcoming environment, one student left the building in tears, and there were instances of expletives being directed at speakers. Neither side of the debate seemed willing to concede their stance.</p>\n<p>The Senate authors of the resolution — Miya Sommers and Genesis Herrera — urged their colleagues to table the resolution for one week in order to better understand every component of the issue. In the vote to table, 11 senators voted yes, 11 senators voted no, while one senator abstained, resulting in a tie. The vote then went to Internal Vice President Mayra Segovia, who agreed to table the resolution. Senators will therefore resume discussion on the resolution at next week’s meeting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1469831126\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50706\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50700\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-05/call-it-deltopia-weekend-beach-closures-confirmed/as_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AS_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50700\" alt=\"AS_WilliamZhou\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AS_WilliamZhou.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>WILLIAM ZHOU / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>Wednesday night’s Associated Students meeting lasted nine hours, as students discussed a solution to a proposed divestment from companies that allegedly benefit from the “military occupation of Palestine.”</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

These forms will then be sent to the Director of Accountability in the Office of the Internal Vice President.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Senator Miya Sommers, who authored the bill, said the goal of the action is to implement a more efficient system for ensuring that senate members are performing their duties to the best of their abilities.</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Anisha Ahuja, a proxy for Off-Campus Senator Genesis Herrera, added that the bill will hopefully resolve what she perceives as a general lack of effort on the senate’s part.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a lot of people here … haven’t been doing the job with the power they were given to do this. They’re not holding office hours … they’re not going to the meetings and getting involved and taking students’ voices into account,” Ahuja said.</p>\n<p>Several senators brought up concerns with the ambiguity of the bill. According to Off-Campus Senator Alessandra Cianni, the provisions of the bill will not necessarily lead to the desired effect.</p>\n<p>“I don’t feel like this bill does what it says it’s going to,” Cianni said. “It doesn’t feel like a transparency issue … I just feel like we already do this each quarter with [applications for] honoraria.”</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Kyley Scarlet said she would like to see more clarification of what particular information would be required on the evaluation form before making a decision on the bill.</p>\n<p>“I personally don’t feel comfortable passing something when I don’t know what it’s going to look like,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>Senators voted to hold a twenty-minute working meeting, in which they could offer their suggestions for the bill without adhering to the formal meeting procedures. During that time, Sommers discussed the language of the bill in order to clear up some of its more vague pronouncements. Senators passed the revised bill in an 18 to 3 vote.</p>\n<p>Senators also discussed the progress of the proposed taxicab program, which would allow UCSB students to charge cab fares to their BARC accounts. External Vice President of Local Affairs Rhandy Siordia, who spearheaded the project, said the next step in the process will be choosing a company to partner with.</p>\n<p>“We’re at the point now where we can put a bid packet together and subsequently choose a taxi company,” Siordia said.</p>\n<p>The Senate also approved a motion to push back the start of their weekly meetings from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in order to better accommodate Senators’ class schedules.</p>\n<p>After adjourning last night’s meeting, Senators went into a closed meeting for an hour. The meeting’s purpose was to discuss personal matters and reduce some of the negativity and contention that has been building among senators over the last few weeks.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 21st 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50271\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50271\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-21/a-s-senate-approves-bill-to-hold-senators-to-their-duties/","id":3081,"author":{"id":183,"name":"Tiana Miller-Leonard"},"related":[3080,3079,3078],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/183"}},"__N_SSG":true}
