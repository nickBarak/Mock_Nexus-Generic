Other hospitals in counties across California are experiencing elevated numbers of cases as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least 20,000 people die in the U.S. from the flu every year, according to Javanbakht. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As of now, improving flu vaccination rates is our best bet at reducing that number,” Javanbakht said in an email. “We’re always looking for ways to boost flu vaccination rates at UCSB since there are a lot of people on campus in close quarters, which can really lend itself to an outbreak.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between Aug. 1, 2017 and Jan. 23, 2018, UCSB Student Health administered 1,862 flu vaccines. In the same time period last year, UCSB Student Health had administered 1,794  vaccinations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help boost these rates, UCSB Student Health offers flu vaccination clinics. Their walk-in hours are Monday through Friday, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. An express flu clinic is also available by appointment and is held on Friday afternoons from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The California Department of Public Health said vaccinating is the best protection against the influenza virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s hard for young, healthy college students to feel the need to get the flu vaccine, but getting a flu vaccine yourself helps protect your ‘tribe’ Javanbakht said in an email. “By getting vaccinated, you become one fewer entry points of the flu virus into your circle of friends, roommates, classmates, significant others, and family members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There would be a drastic decrease in the number of flu cases if 95 percent of the campus were vaccinated, according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This would mean fewer missed class days, fewer missed exercise days, fewer missed socializing days, and more healthcare resources available to tend to other ill or injured students,” he said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is still possible to catch the flu if a person receives the flu vaccine, Javanbakht said those who are vaccinated and fall ill tend to be ill for a shorter amount of time and experience less extreme symptoms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht reported that the majority of the flu cases UCSB Student Health sees are in students who haven’t received the vaccine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to wash hands often, cover coughs and sneezes and stay home when sick in order to stop the spread of the flu. Javanbakht also said using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands is effective, especially before eating. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taking care when touching surfaces where the flu virus can reside, such as doorknobs, tables, pens, paper, ATM, keyboards, etc., and using a hand sanitizer after doing so can also be very effective,” Javanbakht said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that “getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals and exercising regularly all help to keep the immune system functioning better overall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/student-health-diagnoses-28-cases-of-influenza-since-fall-quarter/","id":2760,"author":{"id":208,"name":"Rachael Grand"},"related":[2759,2758,2757],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senators Kian Maalizadeh and Steven Ho co-authored the resolution to condemn Gelb’s comments. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>In the resolution, the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate recommended the I.V. Tenants’ Union (IVTU) hold a town hall meeting with tenants and property owners to discuss relations between tenants and landlords.</p>\n<p>The IVTU plans to host a town hall meeting next Tuesday, Nov. 21, at 6 p.m. at the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, according to fourth-year Daniel Renteria, IVTU chair and one of the resolution’s student sponsors.</p>\n<p>“Nobody should have to deal with this abusive behavior,” Renteria said at the Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>“We support tenants rights to speak and organize against unjust housing conditions,” the resolution reads. “Housing is monopolized by a few large investment corporations and multimillionaire landlords who overstepped their legal boundaries.”</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County tax rolls from 2015, Gelb had a property value of $39.3 million. The <i>Santa Barbara Independent’s </i><a href=\"http://www.independent.com/news/2015/jun/11/isla-vista-investors-paradise/\">analysis</a> of the Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District bedroom tax ranked him as the fifth wealthiest property owner in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>There are multiple videos and texts revealing altercations between Gelb and other Isla Vista tenants published online that are the “most troubling” to the Senate, the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>Maalizadeh, a transfer senator and fourth-year biology major, said at the Senate meeting that he hopes the Tenants’ Union’s town hall can provide tenants and landlords a place to discuss their concerns and work to reach resolutions.</p>\n<p>“This meeting is in light of Gelb’s comments, but can include other interactions similar to this from other landlords,” Maalizadeh said.</p>\n<p>Gelb was filmed yelling profanities and homophobic slurs at Bertrand at approximately 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 7. A friend of Bertrand’s filmed the incident.</p>\n<p>In the video, Bertrand confronted Gelb about the landlord’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/isla-vista-landlord-leaving-del-playa-drive-after-23-years-lists-properties-for-80-mil/\">decision to sell</a> all of his 37 properties in I.V. and said he did not treat his tenants well.</p>\n<p>Gelb became upset and began to follow Bertrand down the 500 block of State Street, shouting homophobic slurs at Bertrand, who is openly gay.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-15/isla-vista-landlord-charged-with-criminal-complaint-after-yelling-homophobic-slurs-at-csd-president/\">announced Tuesday she would file disturbing the peace charges against Gelb.</a></p>\n<p>Renteria told the <i>Nexus</i> Wednesday that the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/records-show-years-of-resident-complaints-against-i-v-landlord/\">Tenants’ Union has received complaints from tenants about Gelb and Del Playa Rentals</a>.</p>\n<p>He said if landlords or property owners harass or intimidate their tenants, he would advise them to “not engage” with their landlord’s actions.</p>\n<p>IVTU created an educational campaign for Del Playa Rentals tenants after multiple complaints about Gelb and alleged violations of tenants rights came to their attention, according to the resolution.</p><div

speech.</p>\n<p>The application, which is due on Dec. 11, requires a resume, a personal statement of 500 words or fewer and an outline of a research or project proposal, according to the press
