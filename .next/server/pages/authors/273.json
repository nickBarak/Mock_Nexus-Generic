university.  <em>Courtesy of UCSB Geography Department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When news of the map’s termination in early January circulated among the student body on social media, students expressed frustration at the termination of the long-standing tool. But the data it used to function has since become outdated, explained Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor for information technology and chief information officer at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that most of the map’s original operators have also since left the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Due to the age of the infrastructure and some complex configuration issues, staff members with skills sets that we previously had, who understood the nuances of the configuration, are no longer here at UCSB,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s grown to a point where we need to staff and license it appropriately.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The map began as a joint academic project between the geography department and other data providers on campus to locate lecture halls, classrooms, food establishments and hydration stations as well as parking structures and meters, according to Hall. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the map was opened to the UCSB community in February 2013</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, early stages of its development began in 2008 under the leadership of Dylan Parenti, the information technology manager of the geography department at the time. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/geography-dept-creates-map-of-campus-local-features/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a Nexus article published in 2013,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the map relies on multiple layers of software which combine to make the map a multifaceted geographical tool.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the map featured interactive tools, including self-guided tours through natural spaces like the Campus Lagoon and lists of the energy consumptions of various buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Estrada, university spokesperson, said that discussions are now ongoing about “the best way to create and maintain tools and resources for navigating the university and real time and helping to ensure the best campus experience for students, faculty, staff and visitors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Hall and his team await the approval and funding they need to relaunch the map, they are working to improve certain elements of it, such as its access to the Environmental Systems Research Institute and Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System, information databases that provide geographic data, Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the funding comes through, “we’ll be right back at it,” Hall said. </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Feb. 18, 2020]: This article was

id=\"caption-attachment-77560\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cajé is the first restaurant in Isla Vista to earn Ocean Friendly Restaurant status. <em>Michelle Sharp / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>To be designated as an Ocean Friendly Restaurant (OFR), a restaurant has to commit to a series of sustainable practices as set forth by the OFR program’s requirement sheet, including eliminating the use of polystyrene products and plastic bags, adhering to proper recycling practices and providing reusable foodware to patrons dining in the restaurant.</p>\n<p>Additionally, restaurants are required to serve vegan and vegetarian-friendly options and provide a discount to patrons who bring their own cups and containers.</p>\n<p>And as of earlier this month, Cajé is doing all of these things.</p>\n<p>According to manager Troy Yamasaki, the decision to make Cajé more sustainable was a long time in the making. He said he believes that businesses need to step up to provide their patrons with sustainable options, especially in a town as environmentally conscious as I.V.</p>\n<p>“There is something to be said about the people who did it when it was the right thing to do and not the optimal thing to do according to market demand,” Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>Daniela Schwartz, co-leader of the OFR program within the UCSB Surfrider branch, echoed Yamasaki’s words: “Young people are always looking to do environmentally friendly things that are good for our planet.”</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.surfrider.org/programs/ocean-friendly-restaurants\">Surfrider’s website</a>, the perks of being OFR-certified include national recognition on Surfrider social media, logos and other marketing materials, launch parties, collaborative promotions and, in some cases, tax-deductible contributions.</p>\n<p>Surfrider was founded in 1984 to protect ocean health, according to the website. The organization focuses on water quality, beach access and preservation and the protection of marine ecosystems.</p>\n<p>One of the ways it operates is through the OFR program, which, according to the website, was founded in 2010 to combat the disposal of single-use plastics by restaurants. The program “increases awareness, drives behavior change, and ultimately creates scalable impact to reduce our plastic footprint.”</p>\n<p>According to Schwartz, restaurants in I.V. are reluctant to commit to OFR status because there is an assumption that sustainable practices are expensive and exhaustive. This widely held belief is perhaps rooted in the fee associated with becoming an OFR, Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>Schwartz explained that the OFR fee is $62.50 per year, and that the cost of committing to sustainable products does not make a difference in the broader financial success of restaurants. Cajé made minimal changes in order to receive OFR status, with the most significant being the elimination of polystyrene products and plastic bags, Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>While Yamasaki agreed that attaining OFR status was not a financial burden for Cajé, he said that while the current demand for sustainable dining practices is still small, “the market will demand it eventually and we are already seeing small shifts. The awareness is there and appreciated, but as far as actively producing new sales, we are on the cusp.”</p>\n<p>Although Cajé is the first restaurant in I.V. to receive OFR status, there are other OFR certified restaurants in Goleta and downtown Santa Barbara, including Mesa Burger, Jane at the Marketplace, Old Town Coffee, the Boathouse at Hendry’s Beach and the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, Schwartz hopes that making Cajé more sustainable will produce a domino effect in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to move beyond coffee shops to get a real restaurant [to become OFR certified],” she said.</p>\n<p>Schwartz and her team have presented the benefits of being OFR certified to the managers of Silvergreens and South Coast Deli in hopes that they will soon follow suit.</p>\n<p>While Schwartz thinks that it is unrealistic for all I.V. restaurants to become OFR certified, she believes that the OFR program is gaining traction this year.</p>\n<p>“Good habits that begin with OFR get carried on throughout life. The ball is rolling. We are hoping to get in touch with more restaurants as the year goes on, and to spread the word about being more sustainable in any way we can,” Schwartz said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the Nov. 21, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-29/caje-becomes-isla-vistas-first-designated-ocean-friendly-restaurant/","id":4269,"author":{"id":273,"name":"Madeline Myers"},"related":[4268,4267,4266],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/273"}},"__N_SSG":true}
