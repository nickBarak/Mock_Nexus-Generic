In my two years as a news editor, I have been responsible for most, if not all, story pitches regarding students of color, and it has always been a fight to explain why the stories I pitched were necessary, and why the perspective I brought as a person of color to the paper was necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past two years, the few editors of color on staff took it upon ourselves to lead frank discussions within the newsroom, the news team and with leadership about the lack of diversity on staff and what we need to be doing better with our coverage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By no means am I saying that the work I or other editors did was enough — the Nexus has historically failed students of color on this campus, and to say that a few individuals cycling through the office could fix that would be disingenuous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The journalism industry at large struggles with these same issues, and without institutional change at the Nexus, and with the high turnover of a college newsroom, nothing will change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an organization that demands accountability and transparency from every entity on campus, the Nexus needs to uphold these same standards. After speaking with other journalists of color and from my familiarity with work in other newsrooms, these are a few recommendations that I’m leaving behind. They are by no means the fullest extent of what the Nexus should be doing, but a few places to start. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publish yearly or quarterly data on the diversity of the editorial staff.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a formal Diversity and Inclusion Board made up of members of the editorial staff as well as outside representatives. (The Daily Texan has a good reference for a Diversity and Inclusion board </span><a href=\"https://thedailytexan.com/2019/02/03/introducing-the-texans-raising-voices-initiatives-same-paper-new-commitment-to-diversity\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). The goal of this board should be to serve as an internal resource for staffers and to oversee diversity initiatives. These should be paid positions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Nexus version of this </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uk0LrP2iM22rY39quqJZBZOstFNAGirJd5KH9hjRAKo/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guidelines for Inclusive Journalism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> document from the Seattle Times Diversity &amp; Inclusion Task Force and hold a mandatory staff-wide meeting to distribute it to all current and future editorial staff members and go over the content.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicate time and resources to doing intentional outreach to students of color and the many student-led organizations on campus that create spaces for students of color. Reach out to student leaders, ask to speak at meetings and open yourself up to feedback and criticism. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertise the opinion section, specifically the op-ed and letter to the editor columns, more broadly and more proactively so that the section reflects a diverse set of voices beyond just its consistent writers. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not enough for the Nexus to just undertake these initiatives to bring more staffers and editors of color into the newsroom. The Nexus, and its white leadership in particular, needs to be more conscientious about how to support these staffers and editors once they join the newsroom, and to listen to what they’re saying, even if it makes them uncomfortable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus’ white leadership also needs to spend time educating themselves about race, and fostering conversations within the newsroom at large about how students of color are being covered. The newsroom cannot make progress if the Nexus tokenizes the editors of color that are on staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, I really naively thought that the Nexus was immune to the problems that plagued this industry. I know better now, and I ask that the Nexus takes these steps and more to do better for the students of color on this campus. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi is an outgoing editor at the Daily Nexus.

After rumors first began to spread about Beasley’s alleged inappropriate behavior, second-year communications and economics double major Izzy Mitchell created a Google Form petition to recall Beasley, which as of May 17, had over 600 unverified signatures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell needs 542 verified signatures for her petition to be valid. However, the board recently announced it will be requiring signatures to be collected through a newly created “secure university platform,” which means that any signatures that have already been collected through unofficial methods will not be considered valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under no circumstances will the AS Elections Board accept or verify any online ‘signatures’ collected through a third-party platform,” the board said in a </span><a href=\"https://ucsb.app.box.com/s/d79ga8w8p4k1n2dwm3u1rcll3srssknf?fbclid=IwAR17QBsfrUuB2Ydb9mvl3m_3W57roaQxV4NHdO8fNrrl5iKFdDVCW3VcgHc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> posted to its Facebook page. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its statement, Elections Board said it was doing so to ensure that there was a “confidential” process in place through a university-affiliated website, and that the petition itself included “legal language from AS Election Code &amp; Legal Code for any fee/recall petitions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Elections Board said the verified platform includes a “secure digital signature field” like DocuSign, and requires students to log in with their UCSB NetID to prevent duplicate signatures and ensure all signatures are from UCSB students; the new collection method would also allow administrators to more quickly verify the signatures.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum at Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Mitchell criticized the board’s decision to require collection through a different platform, noting that the procedures were put in place nearly two weeks after she began circulating her petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to senators who asked Elections Board to consider compromising with Mitchell given the number of signatures she had already collected, the board told the Senate that they would work to help Mitchell convert already-collected signatures to the new platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, board members Davis Quan and Andrew Yan said the board was “scrambling” when they first learned that a recall petition had been created, which they said they only learned about after the Nexus reached out on May 4 asking for information regarding recall procedures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the board itself does not meet outside of election season, the board had considered election season over and had already begun to disperse by the time the petition was released, Quan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Legal Code does not specify how to conduct a recall election, only that 20% of the student body must vote and that two-thirds of those students must vote yes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For typical recall petitions, signatures are collected in-person and on clipboards; Quan said Elections Board tried to mimic in-person procedures when determining how a recall petition and election would work during remote instruction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Mitchell’s petition receives enough verified signatures, the 71st Senate must vote on the petition twice — once to ratify the petition results, which Elections Board referred to as a “procedural vote,” and then to call for a recall election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two-thirds of the 71st Senate must vote in favor in order for a recall election to be held in Fall Quarter 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the vote passes, the fall quarter election, which the board anticipates would be held in the first few weeks of the quarter, will only have one question on the ballot that will ask if students want to recall Beasley. If students vote in favor of recalling Beasley, Quan said a special election to elect a new president would likely take place in Winter Quarter 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two said that if Beasley is recalled, there is no language in Legal Code that would prevent him from running again in the special election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yan said they had looked to previous recall elections in the state of California as precedent to determine if they would hold one election both for the recall vote and Beasley’s replacement, or two separate elections; ultimately, they decided that despite potential voter fatigue, they didn’t want people campaigning for the presidency ahead of the recall vote itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the 2018-19 academic year, Elections Board held two special elections to fill the position of external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA), both of which </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/about-2-2-percent-of-student-body-has-voted-in-evpsa-special-election/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed to meet the voter threshold</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the election to be considered valid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, there was no EVPSA for the 2018-19 academic year, although many of the job duties were </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-28/a-s-senate-passes-resolution-redistributing-honoraria-to-evpsa-office-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fulfilled by other individuals and organizations.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Beasley is recalled but the special election to fill the position of president does not meet the voter threshold, Yan said that the position would not go unfilled. Unlike the EVPSA position, there is a line of succession for A.S. President in Legal Code, which says that the Internal Vice President (IVP) will serve as acting president until a new one can be elected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current IVP is third-year political science major Tianna White, who was sworn in on Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has only been one previous recall movement in recent A.S. history. In 2014, students attempted to recall External Vice President for Local Affairs-elect Beatrice Contreras, who was accused at the time of sexual assault. The petition to recall Contreras did not receive enough signatures; however, Contreras </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/two-associated-students-politicians-abdicate-positions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">later resigned from office</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The second meeting ended abruptly due to multiple instances of Zoombombing, when an unknown individual wrote graphic messages on the shared screen and later verbally interrupted the swearing in with explicit, sexually harassing language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large part of the 70th Senate’s final meeting, which lasted five hours, was spent in public forum discussion about how individual senators and executives had responded to a petition created to recall Beasley after rumors about his alleged inappropriate behavior spread. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Izzy Mitchell, a second-year economics and communication double major who created the petition to hold a recall vote for Beasley, spoke and answered questions during public forum for over an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell called on the Senate to release a formal statement in support of survivors — which they wrote later that night but have yet to publish — and expressed frustration with the senators and executives who have not publicly commented on the allegation against Beasley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell heavily criticized outgoing President Alison Sir in particular, who had </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alison.sirsir/posts/2129784417155065\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released a statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Tuesday night announcing the lockdown of her personal social media accounts and those of the A.S. President due to “extreme harassment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why are we allowing this type of a behavior of shutting down your social media accounts? You cannot choose when you decide to be an elected official,” Mitchell said during public forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell said she emailed all senators and executives multiple times about the petition as well as the rumors about Beasley and asked them to respond. Earlier this week, she posted on her social media accounts the names of A.S. executives and senators who she said never got back to her, including Sir. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have attempted to get in contact with you and your staff for over three weeks. Since you have been ‘always happy to speak with students’ throughout your term, we find it abhorid and ironic that you are unable to even merely acknowledge we have emailed you,” Mitchell wrote on Twitter in response to Sir’s lockdown of her social media accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir ended her final report to the Senate as A.S. President by addressing Mitchell’s public forum comments and social media posts, marking Sir’s first acknowledgement of the allegation against Beasley since it was publicized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was publicly called out on social media for not responding to constituents concerning sexual assault allegations that were posted in a Nexus article,” Sir said, later calling Mitchell out by name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I was trying to make time to work out this issue with our administration, I was harassed to the point where my personal cell phone number was in the hands of people I do not know and [who] were sending me hate mail and Facebook video chats repeatedly calling me a rapist supporter,” Sir added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir declined to take questions from senators at the end of her report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell also strongly criticized A.S. Elections Board for its recent announcement that the over 600 signatures she had already collected would not be valid due to the lack of verification, as Mitchell used a Google Form to collect signatures for the petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahead of Mitchell’s comments at public forum, Elections Board members Davis Quan and Andrew Yan detailed the remote instruction recall process that Elections Board had ratified at its latest meeting on May 15. The board also </span><a href=\"https://ucsb.app.box.com/s/d79ga8w8p4k1n2dwm3u1rcll3srssknf?fbclid=IwAR1cANfk83hiRk5T50pKwNHXS5aWSrDExMXz1dL7JRXRU7zNO3VpcZrU-j4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a statement describing the process on its Facebook page yesterday afternoon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In this new reality where in-person signature collection is currently not possible, the Elections Board has had to adapt and develop an entirely new process for signature collection,” Elections Board wrote in its statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quan and Yan said the biggest reason for requiring new signatures from Mitchell was for the verification, although several senators asked Elections Board to reconsider the rules, given that Mitchell had already collected several hundred signatures and because the recall election procedures were created close to two weeks after Mitchell began circulating her petition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yan and Quan remained firm about requiring verification for the signatures through a “secure university platform,” but said they would work with Mitchell to convert her already-collected signatures to the new petition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, Mitchell expressed frustration at the hoops she said she was being forced to jump through and the fact that these decisions were being made by Elections Board without her involvement. She also complained that Elections Board was slow to respond to emails when she attempted to confirm that her petition was valid.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senators Dagan Addinall and Giselle Etessami had tense exchanges with Mitchell during public forum, with Addinall calling Mitchell’s actions “bullying” and Etessami saying that she didn’t believe the email had asked anything of her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum, now-External Vice President for Statewide Affairs Alia Reynolds also brought up the allegation, calling Addinall and Etessami’s responses to Mitchell “atrocious.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you are actually given the opportunity to show that support [for survivors], you choose not to. You are not an ally, this is not allyship, do not call yourself an ally,” Reynolds said to the Senate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, who lost to Beasley in the run for president, echoed Reynolds’s statement about allyship and urged senators to act in support of survivors of sexual assault at all times, not only in situations relating to A.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sexual assault and rape do not discriminate. But once it’s finally at our Senate table because it’s affecting us directly, because we’re being harassed and asked to be held accountable, it’s too much?” he asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This to me is not about an office, this to me is not about A.S.,” Segura-Esquivel continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the 70th Senate’s meeting, senators broke into a closed working group to draft a statement in support of survivors, first mentioned by Mitchell in public forum and formally introduced by Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the meeting returned to open session, outgoing Internal Vice President Alli Adam confirmed that senators did write a statement, but said that it would not be released until it could be “reviewed by a few different levels of the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 70th Senate’s term officially ended at 11:35 p.m., but as former executives went to swear in their predecessors shortly afterward, the meeting was interrupted when an unknown individual wrote the words “fuck off” over the shared screen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez expressed concern about the potential Zoombombing and considered ending the Zoom meeting and creating a new link, but Adam decided to keep the meeting going and continue swearing in the executives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the controversy about Beasley during the 70th Senate meeting, his swearing in came and went with little fanfare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Reynolds was being sworn in, the meeting was once again interrupted, this time by a man using sexually harassing language.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After removing the individual, now-Internal Vice President Tianna White muted all participants in the meeting as a precautionary measure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All five executives and 25 senators were sworn in by 11:59 p.m., but a few minutes after roll call, White, with the counsel of Márquez, decided to end the meeting altogether due to the “potentially traumatizing” nature of and safety threat posed by the Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given the expletives and suggestive language of the zoom bombing, I ultimately had to end the meeting to prevent any more disturbing and potentially triggering content from entering,” White wrote in a statement to the Nexus after the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to Off-Campus Senator Esmeralda Quintero — who asked that the meeting continue due to a timely legal code change — White announced that the 71st Senate would hold an additional meeting in Week 10, giving the new Senate two full meetings before breaking for the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several newly sworn-in senators, along with Mitchell, tweeted their frustration with White immediately after the meeting, expressing concern that she prevented senators from speaking or continuing with the meeting and public forum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White said in her statement that she will be talking to the administration about how to prevent Zoombombings for future meetings, as well as how to proceed with the agenda items slated for the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><em>Update: This article has been updated to better differentiate between Senator Addinall and Senator Etessami’s comments during public forum.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Beasley said the two did not have any sexual encounter in his dorm room that night and has welcomed a Title IX investigation into his behavior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley has called the rumors about his behavior “lies” and said, in a statement to the Nexus, “these false accusations are doing far more than just threatening my presidency; they are attempting to undermine every aspect of my humanity.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He did not answer many of the specific questions posed by the Nexus about the claims in this article, saying he wanted the Title IX Office to investigate them and that UCSB administrators had “advised party leaders to respect the confidential investigative process of Title IX.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student making the allegations said that after the party in 2018, Beasley had insisted on taking him back to Beasley’s dorm room in Anacapa Residence Hall, where Beasley gave him clothes to wear because the student had thrown up and someone had spilled alcohol on him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student said he was conscious of what was happening as Beasley began touching him, including under his pants, but that he was close to “blacking out.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know things are happening, but you’re kind of like, at least for me, ‘I’m just gonna let it happen,’ like my body is tired,” the student said, describing his state at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He started to feel me up, and I really remember him going under my clothes and stuff,” the  student said. “I think he might’ve asked me at some point, ‘Oh, like, is this okay?’ But again, all I could do was grunt.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I guess he took that as a yes.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student said he thinks Beasley may have believed he was acting appropriately, but that the student’s intoxicated state should have made it clear that he was not able to consent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Beasley and the student said Beasley’s two roommates were in the room with them that night. Beasley provided their names and contact information, and the two initially agreed to speak to the Nexus, but one later declined, saying he did not want to interfere with a Title IX investigation, and the other stopped responding to inquiries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley also provided the names of two other students who he said were with him and the student on the night of the party, but they also declined to speak to the Nexus after initially agreeing to do so. One said she was declining to speak “out of my respect for Daevionne’s wishes.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two friends of the student making the accusation said the student had told them, as they discussed the previous night in a dorm room the next morning, that Beasley had made him feel uncomfortable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those friends, a third-year art history major who asked to be identified only by her initials, S.K., said she remembered the student telling them that Beasley had touched him inappropriately the night before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to S.K., the student told the two that he had tried to tell Beasley “no,” but that he was so drunk, it was difficult to get the words out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other friend, a third-year film and media studies major, said she remembered less about what the student had told her and S.K., but that she remembered him describing an uncomfortable experience with Beasley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film and media studies major also said she was with the student on the night of the party and had questioned whether Beasley should take him back to campus, given that the student was “almost sloppy and slurring” because of how drunk he was. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same friend provided text messages from a week later that showed that the student felt uncomfortable about the idea of being alone with Beasley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Erghhh imma try and not b alone with him,” the student texted her on March 2, 2018, after she told him that Beasley had invited her and her friends to a party.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later that night, when the student texted the same friend and said he was walking home alone through I.V., the woman suggested that he call Beasley. The student wrote in a text that he didn’t want to because “it creeps me out what happened last time i drank with him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student told the Nexus that he confronted Beasley in person about a year later, in February 2019, and said he was “still not okay” with what had happened, referencing the dorm room encounter the previous February. The student said he told Beasley that “what he did was wrong and assault.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley told the Nexus last month that he believed the student was referring to an earlier incident, in January 2018, in which the two had a sexual encounter while they were both drunk at a UCSB-affiliated conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the confrontation, Beasley reached out to the student, saying that the confrontation was “a little hostile,” but that he hoped to speak with the student further. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anyways, I’ve been thinking about what you said, and while I don’t necessarily feel the same way as you did about the situation, I still want to learn why you feel that way,” Beasley wrote in identical messages sent over text and Facebook Messenger, which both parties provided.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If an apology is needed, then I’d gladly do so 100%,” he continued. “I don’t want anyone in their life to feel violated or neglected or any range of emotions you might have been or are currently feeling.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nexus began investigating claims against Beasley after receiving an anonymous email on April 17 that was also sent to The Bottom Line and the two campus political parties: Isla Vista Party (IVP) and Campus United (CU). Beasley has run with CU for the last two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student, who subsequently came forward to the Nexus, said he was not involved with the letter and does not know who sent it. The Nexus has not been able to identify the sender; the message was sent using Gmail’s confidential email service and could not be replied to. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IVP leadership later published a copy of the letter on its social media platforms on May 2, just over a week after the election ended. Justice Dumlao, a member of the IVP leadership, said the party was not involved with sending the anonymous email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said party leaders had interviewed Beasley as a potential party candidate for A.S. Senate in the spring of 2018, but decided not to slate him after a woman had relayed the sexual encounter that the student had with Beasley at the UCSB-affiliated conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student told the Nexus that what had happened at the conference was consensual, but “creepy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I began the encounter willing, but quickly began to feel uncomfortable and like I was about to pass out,” he said in an email. “Back then I felt that I should be polite so I didn’t say no right away but it was clear that I was extremely drunk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following IVP’s publication of the anonymous letter, Izzy Mitchell, a second-year communications and economics double major, created a petition to recall Beasley from his position. Mitchell said she is not affiliated with IVP or CU. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell’s petition would need signatures from 10% of students who voted in the Spring 2020 presidential race, which amounts to 542 students, before it would be presented to the A.S. Senate. Then, two-thirds of senators would need to vote in favor of holding a recall election for it to happen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition has over 600 signatures as of Sunday, according to Mitchell. It is unclear how many of those signatures are from students who voted in the presidential election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said that he respects students’ right to ask for his recall, but that he has no intention of stepping down. Doing so, he said, would only “affirm these lies.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaders of CU, the party that slated Beasley, said in a Facebook post that they would abide by the results of the Title IX investigation, saying that if “these accusations are proven true” after the investigation, they have “every intention” of disaffiliating with Beasley and calling on him to resign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“However, we will not irresponsibly discuss unproven allegations,” the party wrote in the statement, “and will not punish anyone based on unsubstantiated claims.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell said she agreed Beasley has a right to due process but remained frustrated that most students did not know about the claims against Beasley until after voting ended, despite the anonymous letter being sent to both campus political parties and newspapers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was very frustrated that it is very clear that these emails were sent out to Campus United, to Daily Nexus and Isla Vista Party, and I felt like it was not okay as leaders of our institution to deny the public the right to know that there is something going on,” Mitchell said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is not fair to the student body that after they voted, that this has come up,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><i>[Updated 7:20 p.m.]: This article has been updated to include the number of signatures on the petition as of Sunday. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

Yang announced the transition in an email to the student body on Monday afternoon, writing that the decision was made in consultation with students, staff and faculty and with the agreement of the Academic Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Summer Sessions staff previously told students in a campus-wide email on April 4 that a final decision regarding Summer Session A, which is scheduled to begin on June 22 and end on August 1, would be announced by April 17. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university has not made a decision on how it will conduct Summer Session B, which is scheduled to begin on August 3 and end on September 12, and concurrent sessions F and G, but said in the FAQ that a decision would be made by June 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang said in his email that it was likely that the later sessions would also be moved to remote instruction “if the State and County orders promoting physical distancing have not been revised.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the FAQ website, the university noted that specific lab and studio courses do not have remote alternatives, and that “it is critical that students who need these courses be given the opportunity to continue making degree progress in Summer if at all possible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Session B is also when we host our transition programs for incoming freshmen and transfer students, which have a strong community-building component that can best be delivered in person,” the FAQ website reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given the volatility of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the many unknowns, we would like to give the situation sufficient time to develop so that if there is any chance of safely hosting Session B in person, we can do so.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the university does switch to remote instruction for Session B, when programs such as the Freshman Summer Start Program and Transfer Edge are typically held, UCSB is “preparing to transition the programs to the virtual space.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are committed to providing a strong academic experience, access to helpful workshops and resources, and social and community-building activities for our incoming students,” the FAQ website reads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Courses for Session A and concurrent sessions C, D and E will be held during their scheduled time slots, according to the FAQ. Currently, the university is moving forward as if all courses in Session B, F and G will be held in-person, but is preparing to switch to remote instruction if necessary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some summer courses are traditionally held online each summer, but with the transition to fully remote instruction, courses designed to be taught in-person will now have to be adjusted to online as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the FAQ, the university emphasized differences between online classes and remote instruction, describing online courses as ones that “have been specifically vetted, approved, and optimized for online learning,” while remote instruction is being used to describe classes that “were designed for in-person instruction, and are being adapted for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the transition to remote instruction for Session A, the university will not be offering campus housing to new students in June and July, according to the FAQ, but students currently living in campus housing will be allowed to stay during the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FAQ also pointed students toward residences in Isla Vista, where hundreds of students are currently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">subleasing their rooms</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after moving home for the quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Session B, Housing &amp; Residential Services is planning on offering its usual services, but is waiting on a final decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who sign up for summer housing will be able to cancel their contracts with no penalty if the university switches to remote instruction for Session B, according to the FAQ. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will still be virtually putting on its three pre-college programs, the Research Mentorship Program, the Summer Research Academies and the Summer Scholars Program, for high school students. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

The program suspended seven study abroad programs in Europe earlier on March 12 and plans to officially suspend 30 more programs on March 16 as the U.S. Department of State and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued warnings against international travel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of March 16, programs in the Czech Republic, Costa Rica, Ghana, Jordan, Ireland, England and Scotland had also been suspended. On March 17 and 18, UCEAP announced its program in Chile and its programs in Brazil and Japan were also suspended. </span></p>\n<p>On March 19, UCEAP said all summer study abroad programs had been suspended as well.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC policy mandates that study abroad programs be suspended if there are Level 3 Travel Advisories, or “Avoid Nonessential Travel” for a country. As of Thursday, nine countries in Europe have now been given a </span><a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-europe#countries\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level 3 Travel Advisory. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before last night, only </span><a

abroad programs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — China, South Korea and Italy — had been suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>\n<p>UCEAP spokesperson Myla Edmond said that as of March 13, 980 students had been impacted by these program suspensions.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The spring quarter programs that have been suspended as of today

wrote on its website that all summer 2020 study abroad programs would continue as scheduled except:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biodiversity, National University of Singapore, Singapore</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China summer 2020 programs</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hong Kong summer 2020 programs (for reasons not related to COVID-19)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public Health, Thailand</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel noted that the time difference made it difficult for her family, who often heard about news like Trump’s travel suspension while she was asleep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They hear about everything before I do, and they’re freaking out for me, and I’m trying to calm them down from another continent,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some students and their families, the stress of not knowing when — not if, when — the program would be canceled was too much to bear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends, her dad was freaking out and she’s going home tomorrow morning,” she said. “He called her yesterday and was like ‘I can’t handle this anymore, I don’t even know if your program’s gonna get cancelled but I’m buying you a ticket to come home.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the programs have officially been canceled, UCEAP has been working with both the host universities abroad and the students’ home UC campuses to coordinate course credit, financial aid and all the other lingering questions that remain for these students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pimentel said she was told by her study abroad advisor that UCEAP was attempting to convert the study abroad courses to online courses, so students could finish their semesters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But that sounds so impossible to me,” she said, while acknowledging that it would be her best option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once she received the official cancelation email from UCEAP, Pimentel said she would probably book her flight home for late next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t imagine having to crash courses if we can’t even be on campus until the end of April,” she said. “I don’t know how I would go about getting myself into classes. I also don’t know how I would handle housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, Pimentel is focusing on enjoying her last few days abroad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know, I just don’t want to come home. It’s two months early, and it’s really disappointing and really sad, but I just keep trying to remind myself that it could be worse,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/19/20 3:45 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/17/20 3:02 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/16/20 11:30 a.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Updated: [3/14/20 2:12 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.

At first, there were three confirmed cases in Italy around Feb. 24, Woo said. But in the next four days, the number of confirmed cases skyrocketed to around 400, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With all of this happening, a lot of the students, all the people I talked to about it, they were just kind of talking about it amongst ourselves because the school didn’t really say anything about it,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Woo said she wasn’t as concerned about the virus itself, particularly because it is more dangerous for the elderly and people with illnesses, she said she was worried that she would have to be quarantined once she returned, which could affect her spring quarter enrollment at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was just afraid that, knowing [President Donald Trump], that he was gonna implement a travel ban and do something drastic that could leave us like stranded [in Italy],” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if we came back at the same day that we’re supposed to, if we got quarantined for two weeks, that would mean that’d we’d miss the first week of classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the days leading up to the program’s suspension, Woo said she was frequently checking news sites and getting traveler alerts about the increasing risk in Italy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the university did send emails to students to let them know it was monitoring the situation, Woo and several other students emailed UCEAP coordinators criticizing the minimal communication from UCEAP, particularly as the situation in Italy began to develop. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though [UCEAP] said they were monitoring the situation, they didn’t really give updates, they just kind of gave us a link a couple days ago and told us to check on it ourselves,” Woo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students that I was talking to knew a lot more about the situation than the school itself, or at least what the school was telling us, which was really frustrating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a day before the Italy program was officially suspended, Woo said students received an email saying that they could choose to withdraw from the program early. But Woo noted that, for many students, buying a last-minute plane ticket isn’t financially feasible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a quote unquote optional thing, it’s not really optional for those students,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the program was officially suspended on Feb. 28, UCEAP told students they could submit claims to be reimbursed for their tickets for up to $2,000. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Woo and other students in the Florence program only received four units per course as opposed to five due to the program suspension. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no programs beyond Italy, South Korea and China have been suspended so far, Edmond said UCEAP was “monitoring the entire world at this point.” As of Wednesday evening, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that at least 95,400 people across the globe had the virus, and that people in at least 80 countries had been infected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who are preparing to go abroad are being told to continue as if their programs will be held, according to Edmond.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jasmine Khamenian, a third-year communication major, is scheduled to study abroad in Japan for spring quarter through UCEAP, but Japan is currently at a Level Two alert. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In three weeks, I have a plane ticket to go abroad for spring quarter in Japan, and everything’s set, my plan has been to go third-year, spring quarter, but obviously the coronavirus and everything has kind of put me in a limbo,” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything’s prepped for me to go abroad, but I don’t actually know if I’m going abroad.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Japan, elementary through high schools were recently shut down, but there haven’t been any cancellations for universities so far, the New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/world/asia/japan-schools-coronavirus.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCEAP is telling me, ‘We’ll let you know if CDC says it’s Level 3’ … in that case we don’t go, but that could be when I’m in Japan in three weeks, and it can be the second day there, and they could be like, ‘Oh yeah, actually go back,’” Khamenian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the possibility of her study abroad program being cancelled, Khamenian would have to deal with finding housing and registering for classes, which she doesn’t think would be a possibility so last minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know if I should pack for going abroad or for going home for break only,” Khamenian added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s so many things up in the air.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sanya-kamidi-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sanya-kamidi/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sanya Kamidi</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sanya Kamidi serves as the Deputy News Editor and before that was a Social Media Manager.
