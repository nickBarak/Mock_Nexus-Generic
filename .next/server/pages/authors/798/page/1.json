While Governor Abbott claims that abortions are not a critical medical procedure, the fact that women are traveling out of state to get abortions when it is safer to stay at home indicates how essential these services truly are. Unfortunately, not everyone has the means to travel and are instead being stripped of their agency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal court in Texas blocked the ban, but this decision was appealed and </span><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/texas-can-ban-medication-abortions-during-virus-efforts-appeals-court-rules\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overturned</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allowing medication abortions to be banned during the crisis. </span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/00673bc8506133c7a7056c055f001f48\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten days ago</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, state officials in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Ohio and Texas have all made similar cases to implement an abortion ban, but the federal judges have ruled to allow abortion procedures to continue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, this is not a fight state officials are willing to let go of easily and there will likely be more attempts to appeal abortion rulings like in Texas. It is no coincidence that many of the states making headlines for attempting to implement these bans are states who are notorious for their already strict restrictions on abortion access. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are being turned away at abortion clinics, only adding to their stress amid the pandemic.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these states have previously passed </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/06/05/729753903/early-abortion-bans-which-states-have-passed-them\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“heartbeat” bills</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which prevent a woman from getting an abortion at the first detection of a fetal heartbeat </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which can be detected as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. If these states were to enforce an abortion ban with no definite end, women might not be able to even get abortions after the ban is lifted because they would be considered an illegal procedure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women are being turned away at abortion clinics, only adding to their stress amid the pandemic. It is unacceptable that certain politicians feel that they can abuse their power and take away a woman’s right to choose, especially during a time when there are countless other stressors dominating people’s everyday lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The spread of coronavirus has caused unemployment rates to skyrocket, made the simple act of grocery shopping a daunting task and left countless families without basic resources. If a woman decides that she is not capable of bringing her pregnancy to completion, she needs to have the ability to make that decision at all times. This is especially true during a pandemic when the risks to her health and well-being are intensified. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those in favor of reproductive rights have demonstrated how unacceptable it is that politicians would infringe upon women’s rights in an already tumultuous time. </span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/00673bc8506133c7a7056c055f001f48\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genevieve Scott,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, has argued against the abortion ban in Tennessee. She stated that if an abortion is delayed, there can be a greater risk of complications, underscoring the time-sensitive nature of the procedure which several politicians appear to be utterly disregarding. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Republican politicians involved with this debate should not be using a pandemic to push forth their own political agendas. They are igniting a divisive issue at a time when the country especially needs to be unified.  </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Attorney General </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/27/822656455/state-officials-battle-over-abortion-during-medical-supply-shortage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Letitia James</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stated that “abortion is not an elective procedure … and should be available to any person who chooses to exercise that right.” Yet several Republican politicians are treating abortion procedures as though they are inconsequential, which shows their fundamental lack of understanding when it comes to women’s rights and women’s health. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-statements/ama-statement-government-interference-reproductive-health-care\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Medical Association</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (AMA) also recently issued a statement to address the growing issues and explicitly said that it is not okay to deem women’s reproductive health care as a nonessential medical service. The AMA directly referred to how elected officials are “exploiting this moment” and bringing politics into a decision that should be purely medical. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the amount of medical supplies that proponents of the abortion bans claim would be conserved is</span><a href=\"https://apnews.com/00673bc8506133c7a7056c055f001f48\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not significant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The foundation of the argument to implement these abortion bans has absolutely no backing. Regardless, certain states are continuing to force these bans into effect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, it is up to the healthcare professionals to decide if a medical procedure is essential. Political beliefs should play no role in that decision. The Republican politicians involved with this debate should not be using a pandemic to push forth their own political agendas. They are igniting a divisive issue at a time when the country especially needs to be unified.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop strongly believes that doctors should decide which medical procedures are necessary, not politicians. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.

Unfortunately for the U.S., Donald Trump has mismanaged this crisis from the outset. Although it appears that he is finally starting to grasp the severity of it, his initial denial and spread of misinformation has only made things worse. His poor leadership abilities have failed the U.S. in a time when it needs a strong president most. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the coronavirus was on anyone’s radar, Trump’s history as president has been problematic in terms of his efforts to </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/25/21150574/trump-coronavirus-cdc-cuts\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">curb preemptive measures</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> designed to deal with pandemics such as this one. In 2005, the U.S. Agency for International Development </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/health/predict-usaid-viruses.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">created a program </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">called “Predict” to help identify and research emerging infectious diseases in animals so that the nation could be better prepared for an outbreak. This program continued through both the Bush and Obama administrations, but the Trump administration shut it down in October 2019. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2018, the Trump administration fired </span><a href=\"https://time.com/5806558/administration-officials-fight-criticism/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the entire pandemic response team</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that would have greatly aided the nation during this crisis.

He has referred to the coronavirus as </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“fake news,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> his trademark dismissal for all events that don’t align with his agenda. Trump has also </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-coronavirus-democrats-new-hoax-n1145721\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Democrats’ criticism of his response to coronavirus is a“hoax” that was created to hurt Trump’s 2020 political campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s utter dismissal of the threat of coronavirus demonstrates his thorough lack of preparation and education on the subject. Even when he was later asked if he regretted his word choice, Trump said no. He claimed that he was proving he was capable of handling the Democratic “hoax” because his administration is doing </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/29/21159294/trump-coronavirus-hoax-south-carolina-first-death\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“such a good job” </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of handling the virus. This is simply not true, as the Trump administration has consistently fumbled its attempts to contain the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In late February 2020, the U.S. government had to decide if 14 individuals from the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-diamond-princess-cruise-americans/2020/02/20/b6f54cae-5279-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diamond Princess cruise ship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who had tested positive for coronavirus should be flown home from Japan with a group of over 300 healthy individuals. The CDC strongly advised against this explaining that the infected individuals could easily spread the disease to healthy passengers. The US government decided to ignore this warning. Trump </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-was-not-told-coronavirus-infected-americans-would-be-flown-home-from-cruise-ship/2020/02/21/ae58b24c-54be-11ea-b119-4faabac6674f_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claimed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after the fact that he was not aware of the government’s decision to do so, which is hard to believe. Even if that were true, that he would be so unaware of such an important decision is a blaring display of his incompetence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s portrayal of coronavirus as the </span><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/newsfeed/2020/03/trump-defends-calling-coronavirus-chinese-virus-200323102618665.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“China Virus”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is racist. Trump is so worried about getting blamed for mismanaging the virus that he has resorted to pointing fingers elsewhere, carelessly fueling racial tensions in the process. We as a nation have unfortunately gotten used to Trump’s nonsensical rants, but this is especially unacceptable when time is of the essence and the country is in a state of full-fledged panic. We need a leader, not someone who is out to serve his own interests. Instead of guiding the U.S. through these trying times, Trump is putting Asian Americans at risk for hate crimes because he is so intent on deflecting blame. At the end of the day, this is an egotistical and self-serving approach because it does little to address the real problem and will do absolutely nothing to stop the spread of the virus. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One can truly see the extent of Trump’s failings by looking at how other leaders are handling the situation. For example, South Korea has also experienced a significant number of outbreaks, but their </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/17/south-koreas-coronavirus-success-story-underscores-how-us-initially-failed/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">response</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was prompt and aggressive, unlike that of the US. The South Korean government made testing readily available in order to determine the number of cases and isolate those who were infected for treatment. The South Korean government was also more transparent with the information they presented to the public, with the effect of decreasing feelings of panic. As a result of these measures, South Korea has managed to </span><a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slow the rate of infection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Testing in the U.S., on the other hand, has been more of a reactionary measure than the preventative one it should be and is </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/18/817768723/u-s-coronavirus-testing-starts-to-ramp-up-but-still-lags\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still not widely available</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by any means. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, Trump’s ineffectiveness in dealing with the coronavirus is having — and will continue to have — dire consequences. The worst-case scenario for the US is </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/19/coronavirus-projections-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.2 million deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an overwhelming amount of people lacking medical care due to a shortage of  hospital beds and doctors being forced to make heartbreaking decisions in terms of who to provide treatment to. The need for all these restrictions, including school closures and lockdowns, is to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“flatten the curve”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to contain the spread of the virus as much as possible. Our healthcare system does not have infinite resources and we need to be careful not to overload it. It’s also necessary that we try to make supplies last longer, even if that results in a longer battle against the virus. We need only buy as many resources as necessary while making sure that our neighbors also have equal access to them. Now is not the time to let panic take control and for us to hoard essentials like toilet paper and hand sanitizer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is easy to get distracted by the problematic nature of Trump’s leadership, we as citizens must do our part to prevent the virus from spreading. These restrictions are a hassle. Being asked to abruptly move out of Isla Vista and transition into online classes are huge disappointments, especially for graduating seniors. Unfortunately, this is a developing situation and one we must adapt to by practicing effective social distancing and good hygiene. Where Trump is concerned, perhaps there is comfort to be found in looking forward to the 2020 election. It will provide an opportunity for the American people to condemn Trump for the despicable way he is handling this crisis while using their vote to select a better leader for the future. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop is dismayed by Trump’s ineffectual and racist handling of coronavirus and urges individuals to do their best to help contain it.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.

The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is an important amendment to pass because it establishes a crucial precedent that will firmly state in the Constitution that discrimination on the basis of sex is not allowed. As of now, the only aspect of the Constitution that even moderately represents an argument for equal rights is the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment. However, the clause does not explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. The ERA also goes beyond women’s rights because it also applies to sexual orientation and gender identity. Adding the ERA to the Constitution would be meaningful for both women and the LGBTQ+ community. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92125\" style=\"width: 468px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92125\" data-attachment-id=\"92125\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/there-should-be-no-expiration-date-on-ending-sex-discrimination/era-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERA-e1579755369657.png?fit=650%2C770&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,770\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ERA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERA-e1579755369657.png?fit=211%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERA-e1579755369657.png?fit=864%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-92125\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ERA-e1579755369657.png?resize=458%2C543\" alt=\"\" width=\"458\" height=\"543\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-92125\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virginia ultimately ratified the Amendment last </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/2020/01/15/0475d51a-36f1-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wednesday</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Jan. 15, and became the 38th and final state needed for the ERA to achieve the approval it needs in order to become an addition to the Constitution.

The concept of having an amendment specifically for equal rights was first introduced in 1923 but took almost 50 years for it to pass Congress. It ultimately did so in 1972 and became the ERA that exists today. Thirty-five states were quick to ratify the amendment shortly after it was introduced, but the momentum tapered off in the ‘70s mainly due to the work of conservative activists like </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/08/794418122/virginia-may-ratify-the-equal-rights-amendment-what-would-come-next-is-murky\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phyllis Schlafly.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resurgence of women’s rights activism due to events like the </span><a href=\"https://metoomvmt.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#MeToo Movement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh helped push </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/8/21054914/era-yes-equal-rights-amendment-virginia-date\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevada and Illinois</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ratify the amendment.

Unfortunately, over the years, the issue of combatting sex discrimination has become more of a partisan issue. This has rapidly increased under the Trump administration,  as Trump himself has made </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/us/womens-march.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">countless statements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that portray women and the LGBTQ+ community in a negative and demeaning light. His appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was perceived by many as Trump’s approval of the despicable manner in which Kavanaugh took advantage of and abused women. Additionally, Trump has attacked women’s reproductive rights through the passage of the </span><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/communities/planned-parenthood-global/end-global-gag-rule\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global Gag Rule,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which is a measure that prohibits any government-funded women’s health clinic from discussing safe abortion practices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women deserve to be seen as equal rather than inferior. The United States needs to move away from its history of outdated social hierarchy and address the lack of equality plaguing its society. On a purely ethical level, it is deplorable that a woman in 2020 is still paid less than a man, does not have the ability to make her own decisions about her reproductive health, and is subject to blatant sex discrimination through no fault of her own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ERA is by no means a magic button that will automatically erase the systemic discrimination that has become a centuries-old practice in this country. It will, however, be a significant step in the right direction. The fight to add the ERA in the constitution — the fight for women to be represented in the document that is supposed to represent the values of the United States — is by no means over. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop strongly believes that the Equal Rights Amendment must be added to the Constitution to eliminate unfair practices of sex discrimination.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.

opioids</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for his back pain after the accident. He started taking more and more pills, eventually increasing his dosage from one pill to 25 pills a day. His mother described her opioid-addicted son as a completely different person from who he was before.

While talks of settlement mark some progress in achieving justice for the victims and ameliorating the damage done, it is simply not enough. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pharmaceutical companies were directly involved in </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/15/20916684/democratic-debate-opioid-epidemic-executives-sacklers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aggressive marketing strategies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that resulted in doctors overprescribing dangerous and addictive painkillers.

She called for “an America where, when people like the Sacklers destroy millions of lives to make money, they don’t get museum wings named after them; they go to jail.” The wealthy have been able to buy their way out of punishment for blatantly committing crimes in this country for too long. They should not be considered above the law simply because of the amount of money they have. Senator Kamala Harris </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/15/20916684/democratic-debate-opioid-epidemic-executives-sacklers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also touched upon this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, referring to the ramifications of the opioid crisis as a “matter of justice and accountability.” Pharmaceutical executives need to be held accountable for their actions — actions which have resulted in more than </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/opinion/opioid-epidemic-companies.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">200,000 deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call for criminal prosecution against those most directly involved in the opioid crisis is by no means unprecedented. A few months ago, top executives of </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/3/18528123/insys-fentanyl-trial-verdict-john-kapoor-opioid-epidemic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insys Therapeutics </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were convicted of criminal racketeering for their role in the crisis. They were found to have been paying doctors to overprescribe opioids and falsely advertise its pain management capabilities. There is </span><a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2089370/effectiveness-risks-long-term-opioid-therapy-chronic-pain-systematic-review\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">barely any evidence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> correlating the effectiveness of opioids with treating chronic pain and there is certainly not enough for them to have been prescribed at such a high rate. While it is an important step that the Insys executives were convicted on criminal charges, it is important to note that their founder, John Kapoor, whose net worth before this was </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/02/insys-therapeutics-john-kapoor-found-guilty-fentanyl-bribery-case/3561518002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.4 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is a person of color. It does not sit right that he is one of the few executives who has been prosecuted while no member of the Sackler family, all white, has been subjected to the criminal justice system. This only furthers the notion that being a rich, white male in this country is considered an appropriate exemption from receiving the same treatment as anyone else.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This begs the question of why it is not obviously considered criminal when a company of powerful executives causes the deaths of so many Americans.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is considered a criminal act to kill a person in a car accident. It is considered a criminal act to kill a person through an armed robbery. This raises the question of why it is not obviously considered criminal when a company of powerful executives causes the deaths of so many Americans. They have lied and cheated their way through the medical system only to receive more profit in the process. </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/10/20881636/sacklers-purdue-opioid-epidemic-prison-prosecution-criminal-investigation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Sackler</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recently stated that “we have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are the reckless criminals.” Not only is this is a completely inaccurate deflection of blame, but it also shows how pharmaceutical executives will do anything to deny their role in the crisis. Our criminal justice system needs to treat everyone the same way. It needs to play a more active role in fixing the opioid epidemic and punishing those most involved. How else will this country establish that its notions of justice are not contingent upon socioeconomic status?</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surya Swaroop believes that all pharmaceutical executives involved in the opioid crisis should face criminal prosecution and serious prison time for the countless deaths they have caused.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_0341.jpeg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/suryaswaroop/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Surya Swaroop</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><div>Surya Swaroop is an Opinion staff writer.
