UCSB traveled to USC and lost to the Trojans 14-5 and on Sunday, UCSB hosted Long Beach State and lost a hard-fought match 14-12. The team currently stands 8-4 overall and 0-2 in MPSF play.</p>\n<p>“There were a lot of positives coming out of [last] weekend, so our morale is not too low,” senior goalie Chris Whitelegge said. “We are really looking for more consistency.

The team looks to work on its steadiness in all facets of the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB will still be missing four key players, including junior attacker Matt Hamilton. He is expected to still be out with a concussion, which kept him out of past weekend’s matches.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t looking towards anyone specific to step up, but instead it has to be a collective effort in order to prevail while missing some guys,” Whitelegge said. “We just need everyone to step up.”</p>\n<p>The format of the tournament is set up so every team plays two games on Saturday and two on Sunday. The Gauchos take on Pepperdine in their first match on Saturday and the result will affect whom they play in their next match.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine has a 6-6 record and is 0-2 in conference play. The Waves are coming off an 11-5 win versus Concordia on Oct. 4 and will look to beat higher ranked teams in this extremely competitive tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara and the Waves have played once earlier this season, with UCSB coming out victorious with a 12-6 win in Malibu. In the game, junior attacker Ryan Baliani, senior utility Brendan McElroy and junior attacker Bryan Snyder each scored two goals, while Whitelegge made eight saves. The Gauchos hope for a similar effort against the Waves on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We won against [Pepperdine] in early September but we are not coming into this game high-headed,” said Whitelegge.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine is led by redshirt junior Luke Hewko. The utility leads the team in goals with 34 in 12 games. He is a force that the Gauchos will look to contain in order to come out on top in this opening game.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got four games to play this weekend so we need to play smarter and use our energy well, knowing that it’s going to be a tiring weekend,” Whitelegge said. “Our bench is depleted so we will need a lot of guys to come through and do their jobs.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ first match begins at 12:15 p.m. at the Spieker Aquatic Center and all their further matches will be determined based on the result of the contest against Pepperdine.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

season this past weekend at the hands of No. 4 USC on the road and No. 6 Long Beach State at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos got blown out by the Trojans 14-5 on Saturday afternoon in a game where UCSB couldn’t amass much offense against a stubborn USC team. The Gauchos started the game with a goal from senior utility Chase Racich early in the first quarter, but USC then took control and never let go, with three goals in the first quarter followed by six in the second to give the Trojans a 9-2 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>The third quarter was a close battle as the Gauchos held the Trojans to only two goals while scoring two of their own from junior attacker Bryan Snyder and junior attacker Kevin Cappon, his second of the game. The game ended 14-5 after a goal from freshman attacker Josh Jordan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos weren’t able to make up for their loss the prior day as UCSB fell to Long Beach St. 14-12 in another close game between the two evenly matched teams. Their previous encounter saw the Gauchos win in sudden death overtime 14-13, but they weren’t able to pull through yesterday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“For me I think we lost the game in the first half,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We gave up two or three really easy goals to them. One was a rebound goal that we should have boxed out and got the rebound, and then another one we were trying to get out of the half and we committed an offensive foul to give them a big opportunity.”</p>\n<p>After Long Beach went up 1-0, the Gauchos countered with a goal from Cappon before the 49ers ended the first quarter up 4-2. Both teams scored five goals apiece in the second quarter as the Gauchos benefited from goals by junior two-meter Samer Alkateb, junior attacker Ryan Baliani, junior two-meter Liam Gaughan and two from Snyder.</p>\n<p>Going into the second half both teams looked to continue playing physically in the close contest. It ended up being a half of missed opportunities for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The first big play of the second half was a penalty shot opportunity for the Gauchos. Snyder stepped up in the one-on-one opportunity against Long Beach St.’s junior goalie Pavo Ljepopio, and ripped a shot that hit the post.</p>\n<p>Later in the quarter the Gauchos wasted a six-on-three opportunity with a shot over the goal and continued to miss chances to put more points on the board. UCSB hit the post back-to-back in one possession, and freshman attacker Shane Hauschild was stopped on a breakaway opportunity before he was able to take a shot.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day we did miss two penalties and didn’t capitalize on a six-on-three opportunity,” Wigo said. “Those were critical moments.”</p>\n<p>Entering the fourth quarter, the game was still a close contest with Long Beach St. leading 12-9. After the 49ers got an early goal in the quarter, the Gauchos pulled a goal back as Hauschild converted a penalty shot opportunity.

We want to decrease shots in set and force the team to play in the power play instead. On offense we want to get spread out and get the ball to the strong side in order to get the ball into set to our big guys, [junior two-meter Nick Jordan] and [junior two-meter Samer Alkateb].”</p>\n<p>UCSB will be without one of its key players, junior attacker Matt Hamilton. Hamilton sustained a concussion in the match against Long Beach State two weeks ago and hasn’t been able to practice since. It is unknown when he will be able to return to the water.</p>\n<p>“Hamilton is one of our leaders. He’s a defensive player we depend on,” Racich said. “We will need guys to step up in our second lineup and put in a strong defensive team effort.”</p>\n<p>USC will host the Gauchos on Saturday coming off a 21-5 victory over No. 12 Pepperdine in its first conference match of the season. Freshman utility Bryce Hoerman banged in four goals, a career high, while freshman two-meter Lachlan Edwards potted three goals. In total, 10 Trojans scored to lead a well-balanced attack.</p>\n<p>“Last time we played USC we were down 6-5 in the third-quarter and let the game slip away. We have the ability to keep up with them, if not the ability to win,” Racich said. “Last time out we let their players fake ball a lot, and we need to minimize our errors. Our defense made too many mistakes and one thing we will make sure to do is to get out to their shooters faster.”</p>\n<p>The Trojans hold an 11-2 record overall coming into their match with UCSB this weekend. Top performers for the Trojans include senior driver Kostas Genidounias, freshman driver Matteo Morelli and freshman driver Grant Stein. The team finished fourth in the Nor Cal Tournament after a loss to No. 3 California in the third-place match after a loss to No. 1 UCLA.</p>\n<p>On Sunday the Gauchos will host Long Beach St. in its first home game after the start of the new school year. Long Beach St. is 9-2 with its only previous losses coming at the hands of UCSB and California in the Nor Cal Tournament. The 49ers are led by a strong group of juniors including center Ricardo Guimares, defender Zacchary Kappos and utility Dimitrios Lappas.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams played, the Gauchos won 14-13 in sudden death in a very physical match in which Hamilton suffered his injury.</p>\n<p>“Long Beach plays a very physical game,” Racich said. “There will definitely be a lot of energy and it’s gonna be a physical fight. We want to win this one for Matt.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hopes to see freshman attacker Josh Jordan and junior attacker Bryan Snyder step up in Hamilton’s absence.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play USC at noon on Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center and host Long Beach State at noon on Sunday.</p>\n<p><em>This story is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56348\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56348\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/santa-barbara-readies-for-mpsf-opening-weekend/","id":5069,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5068,5067,5066],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Home-Opener Over No. 9 UCSD","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men's water polo team improves to 5-1 with a win over the Tritons.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img data-attachment-id=\"56137\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/vizilabda/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/vizilabda.jpg?fit=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"300,206\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Getty Images\\/Hemera\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"pool\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"99026342\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"vizilabda\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;pool&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/vizilabda.jpg?fit=250%2C172&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/vizilabda.jpg?fit=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-56137 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/vizilabda-260x206.jpg?resize=260%2C206\" alt=\"waterpolo ball\" width=\"260\" height=\"206\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">​</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s water polo team defeated the No. 9 UCSD Tritons on Saturday, 13-10, to bring its record to 5-1.

We knew they were gonna be tough,” Coach Wolf Wigo said. “We did what we had to. We maintained a somewhat comfortable lead and we didn’t let them come back all the way to tie it. If they had, then it could have got dicey. It was a great team effort.”</p>\n<p>​The Gauchos took a 6-3 lead after a goal from junior attacker Ryan Baliani, two from freshman attacker Josh Jordan, one from junior attacker Matthew Hamilton, and two from freshman attacker Shane Hauschild. The Tritons battled back to score two goals in order to enter half time only down by one.</p>\n<p>​UCSB made it a point to work hard against UCSD’s star player senior utility Josh Stiling. With a strong defensive presence, the Gauchos kept Stiling to three goals while making the Tritons focus their attacking plans through other players. With his goals, Stiling was able to keep the score close however.</p>\n<p>​After UCSD’s senior utility Luca De Vivo tied the game at 6-6, the Gauchos went on a run of their own. Baliani, Hamilton, and junior attacker Kevin Cappon scored to give the Gauchos a three-goal lead. From there, the Tritons never caught up as UCSB entered the fourth quarter up 9-7 and added to the lead to make the score 11-7 with goals from junior two-meter Nicholas Jordan and Baliani, his third of the match to give him a hat-trick.</p>\n<p>​A second goal from Cappon extended the Gauchos’ lead before the Tritons scored three goals to trim the lead to two. Junior utility Chase Racich sealed the game for UCSB with a goal with 13 seconds left in the game.</p>\n<p>​“It was a great first game back for us. Huge fan support, school’s not even in session yet and our stands were full. A lot of energy… It was our first home game and a fun way to start the season,” Hamilton said. “Legs [Whitelegge] is the rock of our defense. It’s really easy to play water polo when you have him playing behind you. We just try to make it as easy on him as possible. We just try to do our jobs and let him take care of the rest.”</p>\n<p>​The Gauchos will now look towards the Nor Cal Tournament and their matchup with LMU this upcoming weekend before going to USC to take on the Trojans on Oct. 4.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56114\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56114\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-14/gauchos-take-home-opener-over-no-9-ucsd/","id":5068,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[5067,5066,5065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Brings in New Pool of Talent","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/M1-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7668.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/M1-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7668.jpg?resize=940%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After losing only one graduating senior, the Gauchos recruit six local and foreign players to their roster for their 2015 campaign.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team is looking forward to taking over the Big West next year with its haul of recruits coming in to bolster a talented team.

He is originally from Australia, but played at Cerritos Community College for the past two seasons, compiling a 47-2 overall record, including an unbeaten 22-0 mark this season.</p>\n<p>He was the first player in nine years to win the Junior College Singles and Double State Championships in the same year. Eshmade follows star Gaucho junior Tobias Galskov as a transfer from the junior college ranks where Galskov won the Junior College State Singles Championship in 2012.</p>\n<p>“Nathan is an aggressive-style player who we hope to see big things from,” Davis said. “Transitioning from junior college to practice with our D-1 team will make him a better player, and I expect him to ‘blossom’ into a great player and have an impact on dual matches next season.”</p>\n<p>Mays is also a transfer recruit from Wake Forest University. The Malibu native returns to his home state to compete for UCSB after playing at the No. 5 and No. 6 spots his freshman year and then redshirting his sophomore year. This gives him three more years of eligibility with the Gauchos, and with his experience playing with the No. 19 Demon Deacons, Mays will hope to also play his way into the upper half of the lineup next season.</p>\n<p>“Morgan has been playing in a good program the last couple of years, and I expect him to do well for us,” said Davis. “His lack of match experience this past year might hurt him, but I feel he has something to prove and will be able to continue to develop with us.”</p>\n<p>The three incoming freshmen from Northern California are all four-star recruits. Huang played at American High School in Fremont and garnered interest from Stanford, Cal and USC.</p>\n<p>“Andy plays a big game,” Davis said. “He hits the ball hard, and I think that will translate well to D-1 tennis.”</p>\n<p>Masciorini comes from Dana Point and had a 23-12 record in high school. He is ranked No. 21 in California for recruits and, this year, he won the Boys 18’s USTA Regional in both singles and doubles in Hawaii and came in third in doubles at the USTA Regional in Tucson, Arizona.</p>\n<p>Rakela is currently ranked No. 16 in California and No. 97 nationally. He played for Scotts Valley High School, and, in juniors play, he reached the singles final at the Boys 18’s Johnson Ranch Jr. Championships.</p>\n<p>Gueganic hails from Boulogne-Billancourt, France and earned a national ranking of No. 20 in under 18’s. He plays aggressively and hopes to make the starting lineup next season.</p>\n<p>“I’m looking forward to a much, much, much better season. ” Davis said. “We look forward to hopefully bringing back the Big West trophy to the beach and also hope to be in the top 40 nationally.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 19, 2014th’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55354\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/ucsb-brings-in-new-pool-of-talent/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55354\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/ucsb-brings-in-new-pool-of-talent/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/ucsb-brings-in-new-pool-of-talent/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/ucsb-brings-in-new-pool-of-talent/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/ucsb-brings-in-new-pool-of-talent/","id":177,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[176,175,174],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Decision to Cal Poly to End Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennisKennethSong1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennisKennethSong1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos dropped in the second round of the Big West Tournament to rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team’s season ended in defeat on Friday afternoon at the hands of rival school Cal Poly in the semifinals of the Big West Championships.

Still without Galskov, the Gauchos dropped the doubles point by losing two doubles matches and winning one. Johnsson and Seemann defeated their opponents, junior Devin Barber and freshman Corey Pang, 8-5, but the Gauchos could not take the point as they lost at No. 1 and No. 3 doubles.</p>\n<p>“Losing the doubles point left us really screwed for the rest of the match,” Hamilton said. “I’m confident we would have taken the match if we had won the doubles point to start.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos fared no better in singles, and they were not able to rebound from their loss to Cal Poly the previous weekend. Sultan lost in his rematch with freshman Ben Donovan 6-1, 6-2, whereas he had won last week. Johnsson lost to senior Jurgen De Jager 6-1, 6-3, and Steeb fell to junior Naveen Beasley 6-1, 6-4. This loss knocked the Gauchos out of the conference tournament and thus ended their season.</p>\n<p>Looking back, the Gauchos caught some bad breaks which haunted them throughout the season. UCSB lost eight 4-3 decisions over the course of the season and could have improved its chances of making it to the NCAA tournament if a few of those matches had gone its way. Then, for the biggest tournament of the season, the team’s star and most victorious player, Galskov, fell ill and was not able to play.</p>\n<p>“We’re a young team. We had a lot of unfortunate matches over the season as a whole and the bad losses at the start of the season definitely had an impact on us for the rest of the spring,” Hamilton said. “It was tough not having Toby this weekend but we couldn’t do anything about it and in the end we didn’t win the matches we had to.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now look forward to next season where they will return the entire current squad, except graduating senior Gryaznov. With the experience the younger players got this season, the team is very optimistic for next year.</p>\n<p>“I’m really confident in our team doing well next year,” Hamilton said. “We’ve got the same team coming back save one guy and we expect to build off what we did this year for next year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55064\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-drops-decision-to-cal-poly-to-end-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55064\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-drops-decision-to-cal-poly-to-end-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-drops-decision-to-cal-poly-to-end-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-drops-decision-to-cal-poly-to-end-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/ucsb-drops-decision-to-cal-poly-to-end-season/","id":176,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[175,174,173],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Defend Title","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-8051.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-8051.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces UC Riverside in the Big West Tournament.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It’s crunch time for the UCSB men’s tennis team this weekend.</p>\n<p>Everything the men have been working toward this season comes down to how the team plays in the next few days.

This year, the Gauchos come in as the third seed with targets on their backs as every team wants to be the one to knock out the defending champs.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter the tournament with an 8-13 overall record but a 3-1 conference record. Last time the Gauchos faced off against UCR, the Gauchos stomped on the Highlanders, winning every match for a 7-0 dual match victory. The Highlanders enter the tournament as the weakest team at the No. 6 seed. UCR posted a 2-21 record and was 0-5 in conference play.</p>\n<p>“We expect Riverside to come out playing hard,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “Last time we played them they pushed us hard in doubles, and they will be one or two guys better than they were last time out.”</p>\n<p>Freshman Cooper Bridge leads the Highlanders with nine dual match victories in singles and will be paired with fellow freshman Michael Carella at No. 1 singles. Junior Luis Gastao is expected to play No. 1 singles.</p>\n<p>A main concern for the Gauchos heading into the Big West Tournament is whether No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles player junior Tobias Galskov will be fit to play. Galskov was ill and not able to compete in the Gauchos’ 4-3 loss to Cal Poly on Saturday, but looks to be better for the match on Thursday. He has not been practicing this week, but plans to travel with the team and it appears that it will be close to a game-time decision on whether he competes or not.</p>\n<p>Following Galskov, the Gauchos look for their older players to step up as they know how to win this tournament. Junior Ziad Sultan will be expected to hold his own against tough opponents playing at No. 2, or possibly No. 1 in Galskov’s absence. Sultan will hope to build off his 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) victory playing at No. 1 over freshman Ben Donovan of Cal Poly. Along with Sultan, UCSB will need lone senior on the team Sasha Gryaznov to pick up the slack as a team leader and try to improve on his five match victories this season.</p>\n<p>Also expected to play a big role this weekend will be star freshmen Teague Hamilton and Erik Johnsson. Hamilton has won 14 matches this season, tying him with Galskov for the most on the team, while Johnsson has won 11 matches playing at No. 4 singles.</p>\n<p>“The goal is definitely to win [The Big West], but it’s gonna be tough,” Galskov said. “I believe we have the team to win, and we can only start thinking about the NCAA tournament if we play our best this weekend.”</p>\n<p>The tournament will be held at Indian Wells, where there is an expected high temperature of 90 degrees on Thursday. The Gauchos hope their fitness training will be a huge factor in helping them to defeat their opponents this weekend.</p>\n<p>Also competing in the tournament will be No. 1 seed Hawaii, No. 4 seed UC Davis, and No. 5 seed UC Irvine. The Gauchos’ only loss in conference play came at the hands of No. 2 seed Cal Poly and the Mustangs did not play Hawaii as the match was rained out in February.</p>\n<p>The quest for back-to-back championships begins on Thursday at 9 a.m. against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54984\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54984\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/gauchos-look-to-defend-title/","id":174,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[173,172,171],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dangerous Dane","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UCSB-tennis-vs-Nevada_02.25.2014-upload_Kenneth-Song-5031.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UCSB-tennis-vs-Nevada_02.25.2014-upload_Kenneth-Song-5031.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Junior Tobias Galskov Has Ascended Quickly to No. 1 on the UCSB Men’s Tennis Team","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Denmark may not be known internationally for its great tennis players, but out of the Scandinavian country came Tobias Galskov, the No. 1 tennis player on the UCSB men’s tennis team.</p>\n<p>Galskov followed his fellow Danes to UCSB and he could not be happier with his decision of where to play Division I tennis.

The youngest of four kids, he had watched his two older brothers and sister play the sport he now loves and wanted to give it a try. After playing tennis and soccer for a few years he chose to focus on tennis when he was eight. He then began playing at an academy after school when he was 10 and continued to do so in high school while also competing in national tournaments.</p>\n<p>“I was always the number one player in my age group in Denmark and I began traveling with the national team near the end of high school,” Galskov said. “I went to the European Championships and a lot of national tournaments which took up a lot of time.”</p>\n<p>When thinking about what he wanted to do after high school, Galskov always knew he wanted tennis to be an integral part of it. He began writing to coaches in the United States hoping to hear responses back from them. He eventually settled for Foothill Community College in Northern California. Galskov also did all of this future life-planning without his parents’ knowledge.</p>\n<p>“My parents have always been very supportive. My dad has watched a lot of tennis over the years and has sort of become my ‘mental coach,’” Galskov said. “My parents didn’t know much about my plan for college. I wrote all the letters myself, and I think after everything they were quite impressed with how I organized everything.”</p>\n<p>The two years at Foothill were not much of a challenge for Galskov. He commented on the easy practices and that even though he played No. 1 most of the matches, he did not give up a game. After his first year, he was ranked No. 1 in the nation for singles and No. 4 for doubles in the community college rankings. Galskov decided after his first year at Foothill that he would spend his second year of junior college back home in Denmark practicing harder and taking online courses. He then started the process of writing letters to coaches again, and this time UCSB wanted him for the team.</p>\n<p>“The transition to UCSB hasn’t been that hard actually,” Galskov said. “We had the quarter system [at Foothill] and the academics were good up there. Here the practices are longer and much harder.”</p>\n<p>Galskov is enjoying his time at UCSB, living near the beach and having long summers. He enjoys all the choices for food but says that some of them are not as good as back home. Galskov also loves the laid-back lifestyle of the people and how friendly everyone is.</p>\n<p>When looking towards the future, Galskov, a third-year global studies major, is unsure but optimistic about where he will end up. A lot of his decisions depend on how much he improves on the tennis court in the next year.</p>\n<p>“If I keep improving, I might want to try to play professionally after college,” Galskov said. “If not, then I will probably go back to Denmark and go to graduate school because it’s free there, so that’s a good opportunity. But maybe I will travel with friends and try to play professionally in Europe. It all depends on this next year of improvement.”</p>\n<p>When looking at this year of tennis where Galskov has moved up in the ranks of the Gaucho tennis team to secure the No. 1 singles spot and No. 1 doubles spot with his partner, junior Ziad Sultan, this is exactly where he had planned to be and he has definitely impressed his coaches.</p>\n<p>“Tobias has far exceeded my expectations this year,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “He made a quantum leap of tennis levels in the fall and it has made him such a better player. We didn’t see him as our number one starting the year, but now he has that top spot secured down.”</p>\n<p>Galskov has led the Gauchos this year with 14 dual-match victories and hopes to lead UCSB to a Big West Conference Championship and to secure a birth in the NCAA tournament this upcoming weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of April 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-23/dangerous-dane/","id":172,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[171,170,169],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Rival Cal Poly in Regular Season Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7784.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7784.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos dropped their regular season finale to rival Cal Poly, setting UCSB up with the No. 3 seed in next week's Big West Tournament.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team will enter the Big West Tournament next weekend as the No. 3 seed after losing to Cal Poly 4-3 in Saturday afternoon’s season finale.

At No. 3 doubles, freshman Ben Donovan and senior Jurgen De Jager of Cal Poly beat freshman Teague Hamilton and sophomore Andrew Riminton 8-6.</p>\n<p>“There was definitely a lot of tension on the courts today,” Sultan said. “The fans backed their team and helped them get a good start in the doubles matches, but from there I don’t think the crowd affected our team much.”</p>\n<p>In singles Sultan held his own, playing at No. 1 for the first time in months in Galskov’s absence. He defeated Donovan in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (7-2). Following suit were Hamilton, who defeated freshman Corey Pang 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), and freshman Erik Johnsson, who beat De Jager 3-6, 7-6, 3-0 (retired). Hamilton’s win was his 14th of the season, tying him with Galskov for the most singles wins in this dual-match season.</p>\n<p>“Watching Teague and Erik battle for their three-set victories was awesome,” Sultan said. “I think our team fitness showed off in those matches. Teague had a tough match and I was really impressed. And Erik played really well so it was great to see him pull out the victory.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played especially well considering they all had to move up one spot in the lineup to play higher positions against different players than they had initially prepared for. Galskov’s sickness also saw Riminton’s insertion into the singles lineup at No. 6 but he fell to junior Naveen Beasley 6-2, 6-2.</p>\n<p>UCSB now looks towards next weekend’s conference tournament. Entering as the No. 3 seed, the Gauchos play bottom seed UC Riverside on Thursday. The Highlanders are 2-21 overall and 0-5 in conference this season, and the Gauchos defeated UCR 7-0 when they played earlier this season. A win over UC Riverside would set up a rematch against Cal Poly in the second round. Last season, the Gauchos won the conference tournament coming in as the No. 5 seed.</p>\n<p>“I think we are fitter than Cal Poly, and next week at Indian Wells could be a different story in the high heat and in a neutral environment,” Sultan said. “I think we can beat this team if we play them next weekend.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has one week to prepare for the biggest weekend of tennis so far this year. The Gauchos plan to continue working on fitness, defensive play and finishing matches better as they prepare to defend their conference tournament title.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins Big West Tournament play at 9 a.m. Thursday, Apr. 24 at Indian Wells, CA.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-falls-to-rival-cal-poly-in-regular-season-finale/","id":804,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[803,802,801],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Close Regular Season Against Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7536.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mens-Tennis-v-UCI_03.26.2014_Kenneth-Song-7536.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will compete in its final regular season match of the year this weekend against rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Big West title run continues on Saturday for the UCSB men’s tennis team as the Gauchos take on Cal Poly in a battle between conference rivals, which could have a large impact on both teams’ seeding in the upcoming end-of-the-season Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter the match with an 8-12 overall record, yet are undefeated in conference play at 3-0.

Galskov and Sultan are 7-2 this season playing together in doubles, and this change in partnerships has seen the Gauchos win the doubles point on many more occasions since the switch in the lineup.</p>\n<p>“Our doubles play has gotten progressively better over the course of the season,” Davis said. “Having our top two guys playing at No. 1 gives us a lot of confidence to win the top doubles match and thus secure the doubles point.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s No. 3 doubles team made up of freshman Teague Hamilton and sophomore Andrew Riminton has also impressed this season, as together, the two lower-classmen have won 10 matches together.</p>\n<p>“I expect Cal Poly to play really hard in doubles,” Davis said. “They play aggressive, and I will be really pleased to get the doubles point this weekend.”</p>\n<p>In singles, Galskov will lead the Gauchos playing at No. 1 with his team-leading 14 dual match victories. Following right behind him will be Sultan, who has won his last two matches and nine overall. Near the bottom of the lineup, the Gauchos can expect a strong performance from Hamilton, playing at No. 5, who has won 14 matches this season.</p>\n<p>“Our team is hungry for victory this weekend,” Davis said. “The guys know what is at stake, and they are looking forward to this important match.”</p>\n<p>Looking at Cal Poly’s lineup, the Mustangs will be led by freshman Ben Donovan at the No. 1 spot. Donovan won the Big West Men’s Tennis Athlete of the Week on Wednesday after enjoying a week where he won two matches, one over freshman Alec Adamson of UC Davis 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, and another against Stanford as he defeated senior Daniel Ho 6-3, 6-2.</p>\n<p>Following Donovan in the lineup will be senior Marco Comuzzo at the No. 2 position with his eight dual match wins this season and senior Jurgen De Jager and his 10-1 record from the No. 3 position. The team’s top doubles team will consist of Comuzzo and senior Matt Thompson as together they lead the team with eight doubles victories.</p>\n<p>“I expect it to be a circus up at Cal Poly on Saturday,” Davis said. “The hostile environment will be both fun and challenging. I want our guys to get on the court and let the scoreboard do the talking.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will leave Santa Barbara on Friday in order to get some practice on the Cal Poly courts and to mentally prepare for what will surely be a difficult environment to play in against UCSB’s rival school. The match begins at 1 p.m. as the Gauchos hope to silence the crowds with their play on the courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/gauchos-close-regular-season-against-rival-cal-poly/","id":801,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[800,799,798],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Remain Undefeated in League","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennisKennethSong.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennisKennethSong.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeated UC Davis 5-2 in the last home game of the regular season Friday.

I thought I served well and that helped me a lot,” Hamilton said. “My best shot was my forehand, so I worked hard to get my body to the right spot in order to hit that shot as much as I could.”</p>\n<p>The only negatives from the day were two matches that saw the Gauchos losing in third set tie-breakers.</p>\n<p>As the match was already over with UCSB winning four singles matches and the doubles point, both senior Sasha Gryaznov and Seemann’s matches ended in ten point tie-breaks instead of complete third sets. Gryaznov lost 6-2, 2-6, (10-8) against senior Kyle Miller and Seemann went down against freshman Bryce McKelvie 7-5, 1-6 (13-11).</p>\n<p>“I think this week we will be working on fitness a lot to get ready for Cal Poly and the Big West,” Hamilton said. “We really want to beat Cal Poly to get that No. 1 seed and ultimately get the bye [in the first round] so we don’t have to play as many matches.”</p>\n<p>The match was also the last ever regualr season home match for Gryaznov, who was celebrated prior to singles play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a week of practice before heading to Cal Poly Saturday for their last regular season match. With a win, UCSB can take the No. 1 seed going into the Big West Tournament and thus enjoy a first-round bye.</p>\n<p>The match is an extremely important step for the Gauchos on their way to hopefully making it to the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54821\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54821\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/gauchos-remain-undefeated-in-league/","id":779,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[778,777,776],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Davis on Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennis_Baliyan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MensTennis_Baliyan.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB seniors will play in their final home match this weekend as the Gauchos host UC Davis.

We need everything to go right, and we have a history of guys playing well at the end of the season, so I hope that continues this season as well. I look for our guys to be rounding into peak form for the end of the season stretch run.”</p>\n<p>In addition to Galskov and Hamilton, the Gauchos will need junior Miles Seemann to continue winning matches from the No. 6 position and continue his run of winning seven of his last ten matches. Junior Ziad Sultan has also won six of his last 10 matches at the No. 2 position.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also look to continue winning its doubles matches. What began as the Gauchos’ hindrance at the beginning of the season has become their strength as Santa Barbara has won the doubles point in its last two matches. The most consistent doubles teams for the Gauchos this season have been Hamilton playing with sophomore Andrew Riminton at No. 3 doubles as they have won nine matches this season playing together, while Galskov and Sultan playing at No. 1 have gone 6-2.</p>\n<p>Looking towards Friday’s match, Davis has his players resting their shoulders while working on leg fitness.</p>\n<p>“Indian Wells is going to be about 97 degrees when we play the tournament there at the end of the year, and our guys are preparing for it now,” Davis said. “We are getting ready for the crunch time here at the end of the season.”</p>\n<p>UC Davis is the most improved team in the Big West from last season. Playing at No. 1 singles will be freshman Alec Adamson from Corona Del Mar. He boasts a 13-7 dual match record this season and a 21-9 overall record including the fall tour season.</p>\n<p>Following Adamson will be fellow freshmen James Wade, who is 17-2 in dual matches. Bryce Mckelvie is also 11-2 in dual matches. This young squad will be a formidable foe for the Gauchos, as the Aggies will also be vying for the top seed going into the conference tournament. They have defeated UC Riverside and UC Irvine in conference matches while losing to Hawaii and will be coming into Santa Barbara off a win of their own, as they defeated San Diego State 4-3 on April 5.</p>\n<p>“Our guys are ready for these big upcoming matches. When they show up they can sense the importance of the matches and come out with more intensity and more passion,” Davis said. “I look for our guys to outwork the other teams and outlast them due to our top fitness level.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on the Aggies at 1:30 p.m. Friday afternoon at the Rec Cen Courts and will honor senior Sasha Gryaznov on Senior Day at his last home match of his Gaucho career.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54755\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-host-davis-on-senior-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54755\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-host-davis-on-senior-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-host-davis-on-senior-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-host-davis-on-senior-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/gauchos-host-davis-on-senior-day/","id":198,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[197,196,195],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes Road Trip South","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MTennis_KennethSong.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MTennis_KennethSong.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look for victories at San Diego State and UC Riverside.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s tennis team takes on two California opponents this upcoming weekend at it travels south to San Diego State and UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter this weekend’s games at 6-11 overall and 1-0 in the Big West.

He and freshman Teague Hamilton have been the most successful Gauchos on the courts this year.</p>\n<p>“Toby lost a couple matches last weekend, but he battled hard,” Davis said. “I expect him to bounce back and lead our team against San Diego and Riverside.”</p>\n<p>San Diego State is led by junior Thorsten Bertsch in the No. 1 singles position. He is 13-11 overall this season.</p>\n<p>He will be joined by freshman Jonas Meinzer in the No. 3 doubles slot while senior Hunter Nicholas and junior Andranik Khachatryan play No. 1 doubles and sophomore Freddy Gelbrich and freshman Hendrik Jebens make up the duo playing No. 2.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs are on a skid as well, having lost six of their last eight matches, most recently to No. 2 USC 7-0 on March 25, so the Aztecs will be determined to defend their home court.</p>\n<p>“San Diego State is a tough team and we have had some battles the last couple years with two heartbreaking 4-3 losses coming down to the last matches,” Davis said. “We hope to turn it around this weekend and get the win before focusing on conference play.”</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos travel to UC Riverside to take on the Highlanders. UCR has lost its last two matches to Richmond and Army and will play Azusa Pacific in Azusa on Saturday before returning home to host the Gauchos. The Highlanders do not possess a senior on their team and are led by junior Luis Gastao playing in the No. 1 position. Following Gastao will be freshman Cooper Bridge and his team-leading 8-9 record as well as sophomore Marcus Vizcarra and junior Sean Yun.</p>\n<p>“The match against Riverside is a must-win for us,” Davis said. “We need to secure a good seed for the end of season tournament so we can reach our goal of making it to the NCAA tournament at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>This is a conference match and one the Gauchos will want to win in order to secure a higher seed at the end of season tournament. The Gauchos have two more league matches remaining after this weekend and will look to end the season on a strong note.</p>\n<p>The match in San Diego begins at 11 a.m. and Sunday’s match in Riverside starts at 1 p.m. as the Gauchos hope to start a winning streak to take them towards the end of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Del Nunzio. Sultan lost the first set handily 1-6, but took the second 6-4. The third set went on serve with both players getting a single break against the other’s serve, and the match went to a tiebreak in the third set. Sultan went down 4-1 but battled back to win 7-6 to end the match minutes after Johnsson’s loss ended the Gauchos’ chances for the overall match victory.</p>\n<p>“We were behind 3-1 and it actually looked pretty good because we were at a stage there where Erik [Johnsson] was up a set and 5-3 in the tiebreak at about the same time [Ziad] was holding serve in split sets and it looked like he had some momentum,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “Then Miles [Seemann] finishes on court six so at that moment its 3-2 and we are a couple points from winning [Johnsson’s] match and it looked like [Ziad] would turn this one over, so that was the moment where it looked good and then it kind of all went to hell.”</p>\n<p>Sultan’s win was much needed after he lost six straight singles matches. He has been bumped down to No. 2 singles as junior Tobias Galskov has been unstoppable as of late, winning now four straight matches as he defeated junior Erick Reyes 6-0, 6-2.</p>\n<p>“[Ziad] needed that one. He needs to play more aggressive, more assertive tennis. That was clearly the case today,” Davis said. “[Ziad] has been getting away from the game style he needs to play so hopefully today was a big positive reinforcement. He has to play big, aggressive, dominating tennis. That’s just the way he has to play … that was good, hopefully that was a bit of a break through win for him.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were disappointed to have lost the doubles point again today. The Gauchos got a win from top doubles pair Galskov and Sultan over Munshaw and sophomore Lucas Hejhal. New doubles pair made up of Johnsson and sophomore Miles Seemann lost to Del Nunzio and Reyes 8-4, while freshman Teague Hamilton and sophomore Andrew Riminton lost to sophomore Michael-John Every and freshman Robert Livi 8-6.</p>\n<p>“Once again we dropped the doubles point and that was pretty close too,” said Davis. “We saved six match points before going down 8-6, so we battled there but couldn’t get it done. Ultimately, it has been the doubles point that has been our Achilles heal all season and it got us again today.”</p>\n<p>Seemann won his singles match in the No. 6 position, 6-1, 7-5 over Every, giving the Gauchos a chance at the victory, but it just wasn’t their day. Hamilton ended his run at three straight wins and undefeated at home with a loss against Livi and senior Sasha Gryaznov fell to Hejhal in the No. 3 singles spot 7-6, 6-2.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos host two more home matches this weekend against Georgetown at 10 a.m. on Saturday, moved up an hour from its original scheduled time, and against Radford at 1 p.m. on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of March 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54391\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-suffer-tight-defeat-to-st-johns/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54391\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-suffer-tight-defeat-to-st-johns/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-suffer-tight-defeat-to-st-johns/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-suffer-tight-defeat-to-st-johns/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-suffer-tight-defeat-to-st-johns/","id":188,"author":{"id":67,"name":"Edward Moss"},"related":[187,186,185],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/67"}},"__N_SSG":true}
