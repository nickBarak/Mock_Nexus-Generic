Pérez appointed members of the Special Committee to Consider the Selection of a President last September.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was the</span><a href=\"https://presidentialsearch.universityofcalifornia.edu/forums-and-town-halls.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> second of four town hall meetings; the first was held at UC Riverside</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Upcoming discussions will also be held at UC Merced and UC San Diego. The committee has also held forums at UC Davis and UC Los Angeles, as well as meetings with UC union leaders and UC health officials. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students, staff and faculty took to the floor to share the characteristics they are looking for in a president, along with policies they hope the new president will implement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next president needs to be an ally for immigrant students and underrepresented students of color,” Valerie Johnson, a representative from the UC Student Association, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students at the town hall were also vocal about their desires for the incoming president to focus on campus sustainability policies, including the possibility of creating a UC Green New Deal to address climate change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have an institutional responsibility to act collectively and use our resources to reduce harm and bring about sustainability and justice in our UC communities,” Sarah Bancroft, a third-year student at UC Berkeley, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley faculty and staff were also present to voice their concerns to the committee on a number of issues, including food insecurity, affordable housing and diversity and resource allocation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As staff, we’re really concerned about the issues of equity and inclusion that this new president would bring,” Brian Light, a delegate from Council of UC Staff Assemblies, said. “We’d love to see if a new president could champion some ideas to help the complexities that staff are increasingly seeing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berkeley faculty held their own town hall last November to discuss ideas to bring to the Special Committee. Michael Burawoy, a sociology professor at UC Berkeley, reported that staff wanted a president who interacted more with students, staff and faculty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to emphasize the importance of the new president understanding the actual campuses, and the relationships between the administration, the Senate faculty, lecturers, challenges graduate students face and the implications all this has for undergraduates,” Burawoy said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, the Special Committee will spend the next four months reviewing potential candidates and communicating with students and faculty from UC campuses. The Special Committee’s candidate recommendation for the presidential seat is expected in May.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92427\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/uc-regents-hold-town-hall-at-uc-berkeley-to-discuss-selection-of-new-uc-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92427\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/uc-regents-hold-town-hall-at-uc-berkeley-to-discuss-selection-of-new-uc-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/uc-regents-hold-town-hall-at-uc-berkeley-to-discuss-selection-of-new-uc-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/uc-regents-hold-town-hall-at-uc-berkeley-to-discuss-selection-of-new-uc-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/uc-regents-hold-town-hall-at-uc-berkeley-to-discuss-selection-of-new-uc-president/","id":3464,"author":{"id":366,"name":"Emily Whitaker"},"related":[3463,3462,3461],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/366"}},"__N_SSG":true}
