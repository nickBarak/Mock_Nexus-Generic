My arms were hairy, my legs were hairy, my eyebrows looked like caterpillars — the whole works. I’m proud to say that by the time I got to high school, I was already kind of over it. Who the fuck cares if I have hair on my arms? Of course, every so often a blunt child I was babysitting would still point it out, but it just didn’t bother me the way it used to. I assumed that anyone else who had suffered these insecurities was probably over it by now, too. It wasn’t until I learned that one of my best friends shaved her arms about as frequently as she shaved her legs that I realized this was still a problem for women my age.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we care so much about regulating female body hair? It all starts with razor companies. </span><a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/health-hygiene-and-beauty/hair-removal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gillette patented the safety razor in 1904</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As it grew in popularity, being clean shaven became a symbol of basic hygiene. This made at least a little sense at the time: Because many people were living in close quarters and had limited access to bathing, shaving was seen as a way to prevent lice and bacteria. This idea was </span><a href=\"http://www.vintageadbrowser.com/shaving-ads-1920s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heavily marketed to men</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; to be clean shaven was to be a hygienic and civilized man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1920s, things began to change. With a new decade came new fashion trends, and we all know what the 20s are famous for: flapper dresses. This meant that women’s hairy armpits and legs were on full display. </span><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/137072-100-years-of-shaving-ads-show-how-weve-been-tricked-into-going-hairless-photos\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Razor companies saw this as an opportunity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to sell more razors and began telling women they needed to be smooth. The epidemic spiraled from there, and now generations of women are worried about everything from the hair between their eyebrows to the knuckles of their toes and everything in between. A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, it’s pretty fucking ridiculous. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew I wasn’t alone in feeling this way, so I decided to talk to other women about their relationships to their body hair and how they may or may not have come to embrace it.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A century later, men can have beards and still be sexy, but women are expected to look like prepubescent children. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first woman I talked to was Nisha Jagota, a fourth-year student here at UCSB. One memory that Jagota shared was from fifth grade, when she and her friends discussed what they should and shouldn’t shave before a pool party. “We all got together as a group, like, ‘okay, what’s acceptable, what should we do?’ Nobody had it figured out. Nobody has a good idea of what’s ’right’ so everything’s really convoluted,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From as young an age as 10 or 11, girls already know that they will be judged. They know that there is a “right” and a “wrong,” but the standard is so arbitrary that they’re left guessing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagota told me that she hasn’t worried too much about her body hair since coming to UCSB. One of the biggest moments for her in the journey of her changing relationship with her body hair was participating in the Vagina Monologues and spending time with other women who wore their hair however they wanted to. “It was really great being surrounded by all different types of women, and nonbinary folk as well,” she said. “And visually seeing women who had unshaved armpits wearing tank tops and bras … I’m not gonna say they were making a statement, because maybe they’re not, maybe it’s just for them, but for me, it really was them making a statement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Madi Braum, another student here at UCSB, had a similar experience after leaving high school. “I started shaving my legs consistently when I was in sixth grade, before I even really needed to,” she said. “But for years after that, I refused to go outside the house in shorts if my legs weren’t shaved.” After graduating from high school, however, Braum said something “clicked,” and she hasn’t shaved since. It’s been three years since she put a razor blade to her shins.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dana Laufer is a third-year student at UCSB, and her first memory of being shamed for her body hair is from fifth grade. “I raised my hand in class to answer a question, and a girl said, ‘Oh my god, Dana has armpit hair.’” When she went home that day, she told her mom what happened, and she taught Dana how to use Nair to remove the hair from her armpits, resulting in painful burns that kept her from attending school the following day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Dana got to high school, shaving felt more like an option than a necessity. “My brother used to say it was gross when girls don’t shave their legs,” she said, “but in high school, my friend and I used to have competitions to see who could go the longest without shaving their legs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have no interest in telling anyone how they should maintain the hair on their body. I personally like it when my legs are smooth. However, had I not been socialized to believe that hairy legs are gross, it might be a different story. More than anything, I want every person to be able to make choices that work for them without being subjected to any outside pressure. Let’s just let hairy girls live. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wants women to do whatever they damn want with their body hair.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

I scan the menu, knowing what I </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> order, but I’m nevertheless tempted by the forbidden fruit: beef. “Don’t get the meat,” I say to myself. “You know it takes 660 gallons of water to produce one hamburger.” Sometimes, I stay strong and get a grilled cheese sandwich.

If everyone thinks, “I’m just one person, I can’t make a difference,” then nothing will ever get done. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If everyone thinks, “I’m just one person, I can’t make a difference,” then nothing will ever get done. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s the thing: It’s not completely our fault that we feel this way. Most news and media outlets aren’t reporting politics in a cut-and-dry way. Instead, they use something called </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=186&amp;v=UpqFaf8vQfk&amp;feature=emb_title\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tactical framing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. An example of this is the coverage of the Green New Deal. Essentially, it is the practice of framing news stories around how the Green New Deal divides the Democratic party or how Nancy Pelosi or Donald Trump feel about it. What the news doesn’t say is what the Green New Deal actually is, or why we need it. </span><a href=\"https://networks.h-net.org/node/11470/reviews/11612/bateman-cappella-and-jamieson-spiral-cynicism-press-and-public-good\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kathleen Hall Jamieson</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a professor of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, has written an entire book on how this type of news framing makes the public cynical. When the news focuses on strategy over substance, people are less informed on the facts. I didn’t even know what the Green New Deal was for a while. What I did know was that the GOP hated it and that it would never pass. Tactical framing often produces a negative effect by pitting people against each other and encouraging partisanship.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cynicism is the enemy of action. When we feel like what we do doesn’t matter, we don’t bother taking action. I know so many people who don’t care to vote because “one vote won’t make a difference.” One vote does make a difference, because one individual vote becomes 10 votes, and 10 votes becomes 100, which becomes 1,000, which becomes 10,000 and so on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cynicism is the enemy of progress. If everyone decides not to act because their vote doesn’t matter, or that abstaining from eating a hamburger won’t make a difference, then we can never move forward as a society. Take the climate crisis as an example. This might be the biggest issue facing our generation. The climate crisis means I might not be able to have children with the knowledge that they won’t live through an extinction. What types of things do we have to do to mitigate this crisis? Drive less, fly less, shop less, eat less meat and have fewer kids, among other things. But who cares if I drive downtown instead of taking the bus when everyone else is driving too?  </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things can get better, but we need to act now.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s true </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to make a real difference, everyone has to take these steps individually, and there’s no time to be cynical.

Super Tuesday is on March 3 this year, and the participating states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. It is the single most important voting day in the presidential primary. On Super Tuesday, the greatest number of delegates will be voting, meaning that more delegates can be won on March 3 than on any other day in the primary. And for the first time in a while, California is part of it. Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, Virginia — all of these are swing states that will play a huge role in determining our election.

Included is a link to a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18uJKCx7Zn_HGF4QNjW4FzAUEmkYHlzXyOCdu1Zp5kGY/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Doc</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a country by country breakdown. In this breakdown each country is labeled either “very safe,” “mostly safe,” “unsafe” and “very unsafe,” with some being “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” They also go on to define qualities that make “extreme risk,” “high risk” or “moderate risk” countries. Quick spoiler alert: Of the 39 countries listed, only two get the coveted title of “very safe” (Canada and Argentina).   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before coming across this very valuable document, I had spoken to a UCEAP peer advisor. I told her that I was interested in maybe going to a country in Africa. She was very kind and helpful and informed me that there are more scholarship opportunities for certain countries because they tend to have fewer applicants. She suggested Ghana, since she had studied there herself and loved it. After discovering the country-by-country risk breakdown, I looked up Ghana and found out it is considered “unsafe” for LGBTQ folks, as there are “explicit restrictions on LGBTIA+ expression &amp; rights,” and “governmental &amp; societal treatment is poor.” Okay, so maybe not Ghana. But this must be an exception, right? Surely there can’t be many study abroad options that are unsafe for so many students at this school?</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After nixing Ghana, I did a bit more research and found a summer internship abroad opportunity in South Africa. It sounded interesting and relevant to my future, so I decided to check out its risk level:  “neither particularly unsafe or particularly safe.” Yes! This was a win. South Africa it is. After all, it says queer PDA </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lead to violence and tension, as opposed to Russia where it says queer PDA is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">likely </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to cause violence and tension, or in Ghana where male-male relationships could lead to imprisonment for 10 or more years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why am I so excited about what feels like less than the bare minimum? I’d much prefer a place that’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">particularly</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> safe. Not neutral. While it’s a better option than Russia, Barbados, Tanzania, Jordan, Senegal or Indonesia — all of which are considered high-risk countries — I’d still prefer to study in a place where I can be sure my identity won’t endanger me if it comes up in conversation. So can I go to South Africa? The answer is yes, but I’m still scared. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m grateful to have this list, because I’m sure there was a time when it didn’t exist at all. I’m grateful that I have the information I need to keep myself safe, but there is still something so scary about it. This list is a reminder to me that so much of the world still doesn’t accept this community. The color and beauty and love and strength that I feel walking around at a Pride parade could result in me getting attacked, jailed or killed in some parts of the world. When I sing along in the shower to Hayley Kiyoko, Troye Sivan or Frank Ocean, I feel seen and heard, but there are so many people who cannot feel seen or heard because they are afraid for their lives. I can proudly go see Trixie Mattel at a school-sponsored event and know that I am surrounded by literally hundreds of other students who couldn’t care less whether or not I like girls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then, other times, I’m afraid too. Sometimes I get nervous holding my girlfriend’s hand when I find myself travelling outside of my bubble. I wonder what the risk level is for the United States — depending on where you are, the answer may change. Even California, a place that most would consider pretty safe for minorities, has 83 hate groups as of 2018 — </span><a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map/by-state\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than any other U.S. state. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice to other LGBTQ students out there considering studying abroad: Do your research and utilize the resources available to us. I long for the day when we don’t have to worry about our physical safety when making decisions like this and when I can browse naively, as I did when the world was my oyster. I know that I don’t “look” queer, and many foreign laws around homosexuality are targeted at men so, in theory, I could still go to Ghana or Russia and probably be fine. But the fact remains that the world is not my oyster, because no class credit is worth going back in the closet. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wishes safe travels to all the global Gauchos out there.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

So for anyone else who has known the joys of an East Coast winter and is feeling a bit apprehensive about the prospect of a California holiday, here’s a quick guide to help you cope:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While snow is what really makes winter beautiful, it can also be the stuff of nightmares. First of all, shoveling is the absolute worst. It’s genuinely hard work, and sometimes you might find yourself shoveling in the dark and racing against the clock to clear the driveway before the snow freezes. There’s also the dreaded slush, when the snow turns various shades of brown or grey. Even the coveted snow day can turn against you. For instance, one year, for my sixth birthday, there was so much snow that no one could come to my party. So when I find myself biking to class in 75 degree weather in the middle of November, I try to remind myself that not getting to wear a scarf is a small price to pay for not having to deal with these horrors.\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, baking is an essential part of winter. When the temperatures outside approached freezing and my parents refused to turn up the thermostat, baking helped warm me up. These days, even if I don’t need to bake to stay warm, a fresh batch of cookies, brownies or apple crisp takes me back to those winter days of yore. If you need a little holiday cheer, throw a cookie decorating party or a gingerbread house-making competition!\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My least favorite part of winter is how early the sun sets. Here in California, we’re still dealing with short days but at least we get sun until close to 5:30 pm. Where I grew up in Massachusetts, the sun sets as early as 4 pm during this time of year. It might not seem like much, but that extra hour certainly makes a difference, and if there’s one thing I can be thankful for this Thanksgiving, it’s that I have one more hour of sunshine every day.\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the month of December, keep an eye out for fun and festive events happening nearby. For example, in Santa Barbara, there is an annual </span><a href=\"https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/gov/depts/waterfront/events/light_parade.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parade of Lights</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There will be up to 30 boats this year decorated to the theme of “Deep Space Holidays,” sailing the Santa Barbara coastline. Apparently there will even be 10 tons of snow! There is also the </span><a href=\"https://santabarbaraca.com/events/solvang-julefest/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solvang Julefest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which takes place throughout the entire month of December. There are many other holiday events happening in the area, so if finals week is getting you down, check out some local events for a festive pick-me-up.\n<p></p></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing to remember during the winter holidays is that it’s about spending time with the ones you love </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> whether that means family, friends or the neighbor’s dog. It doesn’t matter whether there’s snow on the ground or what the thermostat says, as long as it’s spent with the people we love. Since moving to California when I was 14, I have been lucky enough to only spend one winter break here. Though I still prefer heading east for the holidays, even though it wasn’t the Christmas I was used to, it was still a fun and happy time because I spent it with family.    </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, there you have it: these are some of the things that have helped me through the season until I get to return to my icy home for winter break. Of course, there is nothing wrong with California winters (most probably prefer it); I just can’t seem to get used to the palm trees and snow-less landscapes come November. But wherever you are this holiday season, I hope it delivers on the promise of being the most wonderful time of the year. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa wishes everyone a frosty winter and a happy holidays.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

I learned to appreciate the curves I was developing, but I still couldn’t find peace from the constant thoughts running through my mind. I was learning body positivity, but it was like putting a Band-Aid on a wound that needed stitches. Some days it worked, and other days, it really didn’t. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contemporary</span><a href=\"https://fusion.tv/story/582813/a-short-history-of-body-positivity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> body positivity movement </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can be traced back to around 1960, and since then has grown into a massive ideology that can be found all over the media today. Body positivity is essentially the belief that everyone should feel that their bodies are beautiful. The movement began by centering on reclaiming words like “fat” and “plus-size,” turning them into descriptors rather than insults or words to be ashamed of. Someone can be beautiful and also be fat — they are by no means mutually exclusive. This is how the movement began, and since then, it has expanded to include queer bodies, bodies of color and disabled bodies. Bottom line: Everyone is beautiful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a movement that I wholeheartedly embrace, and I’ve seen it help so many people grow to love themselves more fully and truly. That just wasn’t the case for me.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until I got to college that I noticed a change in myself: I slowly stopped caring about what my body looked like. In fact, I forgot to worry about my body at all. Maybe that was the secret: Just don’t think about it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, I came across the phrase “body neutrality.” </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-body-neutrality_n_5b61d8f9e4b0de86f49d31b4?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACd-gHx8KbrbEr03nIJ1Wr8SW67sDdMuv9l21DwyVphhb54vW1xFYzadoEMWJMkxA5SI2hqzLBy7fpUcjFzJViV2iLDsz79LIVOfuwakqFooox8ebpo_jI6mfiqealV-NeoBp5Ese6WXCx0OSG5CbEZ1R4dmH-Fm7RVOsjycIx8A\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Body neutrality</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the practice of not thinking about your body or how it looks at all. I am an active person, so for me, that means thinking about what my body can do, rather than how it looks. I found that the less I overanalyze how my body looks — even if I’m focusing on the positives — the happier I am. My body can swim and dance and hike. It can eat a ridiculous amount of ice cream without feeling sick (it can’t really handle doughnuts though … we’re working on that) and take me from Campbell Hall to I.V. Theater in less than 10 minutes. I can love and appreciate my body so much more when I stop looking in the mirror. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I choose body neutrality over body positivity, I don’t want to suggest that this is what works for everyone. Body positivity was designed for people who were, and still are, attacked, marginalized and discriminated against because of their size, shape or color. Body positivity could be the best practice for those people, and that is incredible. For me, sometimes it’s just easier not to think about it. And that’s not to say that body neutrality is running away from the problem but rather finding a different solution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got to college, I began practicing body neutrality by accident and, luckily for me, it worked. I found myself surrounded by people who just didn’t talk about their bodies in the way I was used to. Our lives were about picking a major and studying for midterms. They were about exploring a new campus and a new city. Sorry, no time to worry about whether or not my thighs are touching — I have class in 10 minutes and an essay due at midnight. Body positivity might not be for everyone, so why not give body neutrality a try?</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anabel Costa recommends getting rid of all the mirrors in your house.   </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.

stepped off the plane and my lungs filled with familiarity. I was in a home I’d only dreamed of, but it was a dream so often-recurring I could have sworn I’d been there before. I could finally breathe the island air of São Miguel, Portugal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My father was born in a village in São Miguel, and although he left when he was only five, much of his family still lives there today. Despite feeling immediately connected with this new world I’d just stepped into, I couldn’t help but feel out of place as I walked through the small airport and made my way to my cousins’ house where I would be staying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I struggled to understand my family and my surroundings, I began to realize I might not know Portugal as well as I thought. It’s an odd feeling, having such a connection to a place you’ve never been to. But despite never truly feeling like I knew this part of my identity, I always held it close. And now everything was foreign, yet so familiar. From the black and white bricks painting the streets like murals to the red-roofed homes scattered across mountains, I knew none of it, yet still felt some personal claim to the beauty. The earthy richness of the fava bean or the spicy tang of bacalhau — these flavors were mine yet I was a stranger. I desperately wanted to be a part of this country, but it felt like reaching for something I knew I’d never find. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I began getting to know members of my extended family, some I’d met when I was young, and some I’d never met at all. I quickly discovered how difficult it was for me to communicate and get to know them, because of one crucial difference: language. While some of my cousins spoke fluent English, most of them spoke little to none. I realized I had less than a month to soak up everything I could about my family and this island, so we were going to have to find other ways to communicate —and fast. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I learned how to say “fucker.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One day, after spending most of it sitting awkwardly in the back seat, listening to my cousins speak while one of them intermittently provided me with translations, we found ourselves at a music festival, and that is where I learned my first curse word in Portuguese: “tu és uma caralha,” (which loosely translates to “you are a fucker”). Suddenly I was calling everyone a fucker; that trash can? A fucker. My cousin? A fucker. The stage? The tents? All fuckers. All of them. And just like that, the floodgates of communication were open. It might sound silly, and probably juvenile, but something about learning that phrase broke the ice; suddenly I could make my cousins laugh. We could have fun together. We could be honest and authentic and find ways to know each other beyond making menial small talk, because small talk was hardly even possible. I gained confidence to learn more words and phrases, but more importantly, I realized that a language barrier didn’t have to be the end-all be-all of getting to know my family or my country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than stifling myself, finding new ways of communicating became fun. In addition to shouting obscenities, one such way was through music. I taught some of my younger cousins to play the ukulele. You don’t need words to show someone where to place their fingers to make a G chord. We played songs both new and familiar to each of us, sometimes singing, sometimes humming. I also got to know my family through food. Together we explored flavors both new and familiar to me. I tried biffana from a food truck, and sangria from a waterfront restaurant. We played in the ocean and got pastries at midnight.

The idea is that someone with a growth mindset believes that their intelligence and skill can improve over time and with experience, while in contrast, someone with a fixed mindset believes that their intelligence and skills are fixed traits that cannot change. These beliefs are underlying, but they nonetheless dictate a lot about how we learn — Dweck’s research has shown that people with growth mindsets find more success and satisfaction in learning than those with a fixed mindset. But while this concept mainly focuses on the way we learn, Dweck also suggests that our mindsets can have a huge impact on other aspects of our lives as well, whether that be academic, professional or personal.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I was learning about this research and the different kinds of mindsets, I began to recognize myself as a “fixed” thinker, but I also noticed that I wasn’t always like this. I remembered when I was younger and eager to pick myself up each time I fell down, and whether it was in the classroom or the studio, I wasn’t afraid to make mistakes. Somewhere between tutus and teendom, I lost my capability to bounce back from perceived failures. After learning about these different mindsets and finally acknowledging that my negativity was helping no one, I knew I wanted to make a change. But the question remained: how? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My fixed mindset made my first year of college very difficult. I found myself often discouraged and simply giving up academically. I took a math class in the winter of my freshman year, and no matter what I did, I couldn’t seem to overcome the overwhelming thought that I wasn’t good at math and never could be. I let the homework pile up and the self-doubt devour me. Remember: One of the identifying characteristics of someone with a fixed mindset is the belief that their baseline intelligence can’t be changed, and I was a textbook example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearing the end of my first year, I was rapidly losing confidence in who I could be academically and artistically. It wasn’t until the next fall that I had my lightbulb moment. One morning I went to my dramatic writing professor’s office hours to tell her I was excited to write but I was worried that I sucked, and she said something along the lines of “everyone sucks until they don’t.” It took me a while to warm up to the idea, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it’s OK to suck; in fact, everyone sucks at some point, and especially at the beginning. In that class, I delved into the world of podcasts about writing and books on dramatic writing, and I discovered three fundamental truths: 1) first drafts always suck, 2) you will face a lot of rejection, 3) the only way to be a good writer is to write. Learning these things through the lens of writing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">something I love and am </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sensitive about </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made me realize that they apply to everything.

Sleepovers are riddled with questions like, “When will I lose my virginity?” or, “How did </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lose your virginity?” These questions always plagued me, yet at the same time, they brought immense curiosity. As a queer woman, I have a lot of confusion and frustration with the word itself. Over time I’ve come to realize that virginity doesn’t even exist; by definition, it refers to the first time someone has sex, but sex can mean different things to different people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the occasions that I have found myself in a circle of friends, talking about virginity or how we lost it, more than one of the stories always seem to end with some statement like, “It went in and out like three times and then we were done.” Now, there is nothing wrong with this, and if both members felt like it was sex, then it was, because sex should be defined by the individuals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My issues with this only come in when queer women who have had sex with other women are considered virgins simply because they’ve never been penetrated. My girlfriend has been called a virgin by our friends because they don’t readily accept what we do as sex. So if my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.” Ultimately, sex is culturally defined by the presence of a penis, or at least some form of penetration, and this is just wrong.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

We often miss out on having those stories about our “first time,” because no one ever talks about what that would even look like. One of the things I heard about while I was growing up was “scissoring,” and I thought, “So, are we just supposed to smash our labia together until we both come in one simultaneous moment of bliss?” No, young Anabel, nobody does that. The next thing you might learn is that lesbians lose their virginity when they are eaten out. This sounds great, except men can eat out girls as well, so why are straight women who have only been eaten out still considered virgins?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s almost as if we’re agreeing that gay women really only get half the experience that straight women get, and as someone who has had sex with both men and women, that just doesn’t feel like the truth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what’s next? The strap-on. If you have just been fucked with a strap-on for the first time, most people would argue you have lost your virginity. But what about the person who wore it? I doubt that many people would consider that a loss of virginity for the giver. Truth be told, I don’t know how queer women lose their virginity with the cultural definition we currently hold, and that’s why the definition must change.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If my intimate experiences with my girlfriend are not sex, then neither is your “in and out three times on the fourth floor of the library.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stated earlier that losing your virginity is defined by the first time a person has sex. This implies that in order to understand what that means, we must first decide what it means to have sex. My definition of sex is that it must be a consensual, intimate, vulnerable and, of course, sexual act. That’s it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of my straight friends, after having sex for the first time, reported that they didn’t feel any different. I myself reported the same thing after having sex with a man. This is probably because we had already had milestone-like experiences that were consensual, intimate, vulnerable and sexual that did make us feel different or changed. At least, I know this is the case for myself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can pinpoint a couple times when I actually felt like I lost my virginity that don’t match the classic definition. It wasn’t the first time I had sex with a man, or the first time a girl ate me out, or even the first time I was fucked with a strap-on. I would say I lost my virginity the first time my girlfriend saw me naked and I felt my most vulnerable — but also my most beautiful. I could also say it was the first time I gave my girlfriend an orgasm, even if it was only with my hands. I could even argue that with each new partner I am losing my virginity over and over again, because I am learning to be vulnerable with someone new — just like how every kiss with a new person feels like my first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your moment is, the point is that it doesn’t matter. Sex is whatever it feels like it should be to you and your partner. Plus, virginity is made up anyway, so who really cares?       </span></p>\n<p><em>Anabel Costa wants Gauchos to define their own intimate experiences as they see fit.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_4128.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/anabel-costa/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Anabel Costa</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Anabel Costa is an Opinion staff writer.
