Nick Song / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Greek life at UCSB over the past four years has been marked by the closing of several chapters of fraternities by their parent organizations, as well as a loss of standing among the campus community at UCSB.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>    Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity lost its standing with UCSB due to “risk management violations of the campus’s alcohol-free social event policy.” It still operates without the consent of the university.</li>\n<li>    The sorority Alpha Kappa Delta Phi was closed by its headquarters due to “risk management violations and hazing.”</li>\n<li>    Beta Theta Pi (Beta) was closed by its parent organization due to “risk management violations and hazing.”</li>\n<li>    Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity (NAK) closed after it was charged with “risk management violations in conjunction with sexual harassment/sexual assault.”</li>\n<li>    Phi Delta Theta Colony (Phi Delt) left campus due to “risk management violations,” which its parent organization felt were “incongruent with headquarter policies and values.”</li>\n<li>    Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity (Phi Sig) closed due to risk management violations, hazing and sexual harassment/sexual assault.</li>\n<li>    Delta Delta Delta Sorority (Tri Delta) will close in June 2019 due to decreased membership.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to both students involved in Greek Life through the Interfraternity Council (IFC) as well as staff in the Office of Student Life (OSL), recent developments indicate improvement.</p>\n<p>Emma Parker, a scheduling systems manager representing the Office of the Dean of Students at UCSB, wrote that the Greek-lettered organizations at UCSB have “made great strides in the last few years toward building a safer, more responsible community through education, student-led initiatives, and programming.”</p>\n<p>OSL Director Miles Ashlock also noted different approaches from both the student and administrative sides.</p>\n<p>“We did have a rash of really serious, high-profile cases, which I think attracted a lot of attention,” Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>“Probably people realized that ‘hey, if the university is taking these steps then there must be something really concerning; we really need to look out for ourselves and each other, and take better care.’”</p>\n<p>Ashlock said student leaders within Greek organizations have taken more initiative in fostering relationships with administration.</p>\n<p>“I think we have seen some significant developments in terms of student leaders stepping up to create internal policies and procedures that contribute to the safety and better operation of their organizations. They have been a lot more open with us in terms of disclosing concerns, asking questions and proposing solutions,” he said.</p>\n<p>OSL has overhauled the way that staff members interact with those affiliated with Greek life, giving the Greek organizations more opportunities to interact with a wider variety of people in the office.</p>\n<p>“We started to cross-train, so rather than have a separate unit involving fraternities and sororities, work is divided among multiple people, so fraternities and sororities get to know pretty much everyone,” Ashlock said.</p>\n<p>Having closer relationships with a broader scope of staff has given Greek life “a lot more opportunities to interact and a lot of opportunity for [OSL] to connect with them across our program areas with other campus organizations and leadership development,” he added.</p>\n<p>Ashlock also said there are broader shifts in the demographics of the university which reflect in the conduct of fraternities and sororities.</p>\n<p>“I’m heartened to see the demographics of our campus more closely reflect the demographics of the state,” he said.</p>\n<p>“What I see is an ever-increasing emphasis on school and studies and people seeing the value of education over maybe what was the in the ‘80s or ‘90s the perceived ‘coming-of-age experience in college.’”</p>\n<p>UCSB IFC President Zachary Hedges noted that the IFC, in cooperation with other Greek councils, has worked to develop an accreditation program.</p>\n<p>The program includes workshops that aim to “help students improve their well-being and learn to recognize and prevent the potentially dangerous situations that are most common.”</p>\n<p>Ongoing collaboration with campus organizations such as Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), Alcohol and Drug Program (ADP) and Campus Advocacy, Resources, &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.), have helped ensure that these workshops remain “relevant and engaging,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>“The IFC is also a strong advocate of making sure that all of our members are encouraged to report sexual assault and understand the options available to them in order to do so.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appear on p. 3 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Sean Crommelin is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-85022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patrisse Cullors spoke at UCSB on Nov. 15. <em>Katelyn Zamudio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The event, put on by the UCSB MultiCultural Center (MCC), has been in the making for nearly nine months, according to MCC Director Zaveeni Khan-Marcus.</p>\n<p>“[Cullors’] voice and the message she gives is so powerful. We felt that it was important for her to come to campus and talk about her experience,” Khan-Marcus said.</p>\n<p>Cullors, an activist and artist, spoke prominently about the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>She discussed how the acquittal of Neighborhood Watch Coordinator George Zimmerman after his killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin caused outrage among those in the black community and beyond.</p>\n<p>“It was a response, it was a guttural response to one of our tragedies of our generation,” Cullors said.</p>\n<p>She condemned Zimmerman’s trial and subsequent acquittal, stating Zimmerman’s defense “[tried] to build a defense that Trayvon Martin deserved to die.”</p>\n<p>Cullors, a native of San Fernando Valley, also spoke about growing up in a community which resented the police and intimately felt the effects of mass incarceration. She highlighted the paradoxes in the American justice system, exemplified by Zimmerman’s not-guilty verdict.</p>\n<p>“I sat with a contradiction of living in a country that has two million people in prison, one million of them black and George Zimmerman, a white-passing Latino, gets to kill a human being and go home free.”</p>\n<p>Fellow activist Alicia Garza’s subsequent coinage of the term “Black Lives Matter” in a Facebook post, and Cullors’ decision to attach a hashtag to it in a post expressing her frustration, led to #BlackLivesMatter becoming a viral phenomenon – and later, a tangible social movement.</p>\n<p>However, Cullors emphasized the continuity of the Black Lives Matter movement with regards to the past.</p>\n<p>“This concept of Black Lives Matter has lineage. It’s a part of the Black Power Movement,” she said. “We stand on the shoulders of giants.”</p>\n<p>Cullors emphasized the importance of becoming involved with issues beyond the confines of social media and fostering relationships with other organizations, such as the Women’s March and the #MeToo movement.</p>\n<p>“Contrary to the media, a hashtag doesn’t start an actual movement. It takes skills, it takes organizing, it takes commitment and it takes sacrifice,” she said.</p>\n<p>For those within the MCC, Cullors’ talk surpassed already-high expectations.</p>\n<p>MCC Program Coordinator Abire Sabbagh expressed relief that Cullors didn’t avoid sensitive topics and instead tackled touchy subjects with grace and eloquence.</p>\n<p>“We’re not going to sugarcoat anything. We’re going to talk about the struggles and we’re going to talk about how hard it is, but we’re also going to talk about what we do and how we build the movement that we need to liberate ourselves,” Sabbagh said.</p>\n<p>Khan-Marcus also admired Cullors’ ability to bring light to the issues by talking about her own personal experiences and how a sense of community and family gave Cullors a refuge from suffering.</p>\n<p>“She talked about all the hardship she went through as a child, but there’s also a sense of love,” Khan-Marcus said. “I’m absolutely thrilled. Her presence itself was incredible.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
