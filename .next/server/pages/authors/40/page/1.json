Even if those who did not receive their absentee ballots in time and were unable to vote in person are granted some mechanism by which to cast a vote  — which is at this point an impossibility given the SCOTUS ruling — there are still tens of thousands more who were forced to expose themselves during a pandemic to exercise what is supposed to be their constitutional right. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no doubt that the coronavirus will continue to spread, with this election exacerbating what is already a rapidly escalating pandemic. There is little doubt that people will die because of decisions made by the Wisconsin legislature, the Wisconsin Supreme Court and, outrageously, even the United States Supreme Court.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hypocrisy — and partisanship — is a stain on Wisconsin lawmakers and the Supreme Court.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poll workers, many of them elderly, chose not to work, which was reasonable considering the health risk doing so would have posed.

I place no blame on the poll workers who found themselves in such a harrowing situation and took care to minimize the risk of coming into contact with the disease. However, given the circumstances and the virulence of COVID-19, there was no sufficient way to protect the public against this virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Republican Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Robin Vos, </span><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/08/wisconsin-elections-robin-vos-draws-criticism-ppe-voting-remarks/2967319001/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">draped himself in personal protective equipment while working the polls</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, despite claiming that it was “perfectly safe to go out” and vote in person. Obviously, no such PPE was available for voters — it’d be a logistical nightmare — but Vos’ unwillingness to even signal solidarity or acknowledge the risks inherent in voting during this time is an act of unconscionable hypocrisy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That the U.S. Supreme Court was able to block a deadline extension for absentee ballots received late in the wake of significant challenges caused by coronavirus, while they themselves delivered their ruling </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/10/supreme-court-voted-remotely-deny-wisconsin-voters/5127252002/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remotely</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is hypocrisy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hypocrisy — and partisanship — is a stain on Wisconsin lawmakers and the Supreme Court. The politicization of the judiciary branch is no secret in Wisconsin. However, to drop even the pretense that the Supreme Court and the legislature have regard for the safety of citizens signals the nauseatingly palpable desperation of the GOP to maintain their minority rule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, carrying out in-person voting during the uptick period of a pandemic is only the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> egregious way the GOP in Wisconsin has worked to silence Democratic voters.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lafayette emphasized the importance of nonviolent resistance, having worked closely with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. </span><em>Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 20, Lafayette, a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, came to UC Santa Barbara to talk to the student body about how to live as conscious citizens in a world shaped by the actions of social activists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion, titled “An Evening with Dr. Bernard Lafayette Jr.: Nonviolence in a Time of Civil Unrest,” was organized by the Associated Students Program Board and marked Lafayette’s first visit to the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most associated with the Freedom Riders and later the Selma Voting Rights movement, Lafayette emphasized the importance of nonviolent resistance, having worked closely with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Diane Nash and James Bevel in the American Civil Rights Movement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1967, King even offered Lafayette a position as the program director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus before the lecture, Lafayette went into detail regarding his experiences as a political organizer and a protester, working with the Nashville Student Movement, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the SCLC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also lamented traits that he said he has seen in some present-day social movements and activists, such as a tendency to focus on the problems themselves rather than proposed solutions, as well as an inability to look at their activism from a broader perspective.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Present-day activists] need to reexamine to see whether or not they’re taking everything into consideration. And whether or not they’re benefiting also from the laws enacted, changed and whether or not they are harmful to themselves or harmful to others as well,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Public policy is very much related to what people expect and expectations from constituencies that are involved … they can’t look at it from a narrow, narrow view. Unfortunately, people sometimes make decisions [solely] based on their own ethnic identity or political affiliation,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also noted that the arrival of advanced technology, such as the internet, has allowed people who share similar values and ways of thinking to establish forums and foster vibrant communities of activists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media, for instance, changed the playing field in regards to how opinions, personal musings and even breaking news is communicated to and amongst the masses, Lafayette said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[With social media] you can communicate with large numbers of people,” he said. “We didn’t have that. We had to use little simple methods and depend so much on the public media.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a relationship with the media, however, still remains an incredibly important thing to do, Lafayette said. He added that the media is the party that will project a social movement to the broader public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s how we were able to accomplish the things that we accomplished, because we learned how to deal with the media. Part of the whole movement is to reach the masses of people … you need to pay special attention to maintain and sustain a movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The media is [still] important … you have to learn how to maintain communication with the media in such a way that your movement is able to continue,” Lafayette said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Lafayette recalled his experience as one of the original Freedom Riders, civil rights activists who protested segregated buses in the South by riding interstate buses from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans in mixed-race groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Freedom Riders were arrested in Jackson, Mississippi, Lafayette said he and his companions were able to create more publicity for their movement when they were taken into police custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rather than [make bail] and continue on to New Orleans, we decided to stay in jail a longer period of time. We stayed in jail to prolong the movement,” Lafayette said, adding that “as a result of this, we had [people from] about 11 different countries come to the U.S.” to express solidarity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he began his talk, Lafayette started to discuss lineage, speaking to the crowd about his formative years growing up in the Tampa, Florida area, as well as his Afro-Caribbean and French roots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the talk, Lafayette focused on the distinction between successful and unsuccessful social movements, asking, “What are some of the techniques and strategies that are actually applicable universally?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest answer to this, according to Lafayette, is also the simplest: disciplined nonviolence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He attributed the significance of civil disobedience to its ability to invalidate unjust laws without resorting to acts of violence. In particular, Lafayette emphasized the importance of accepting the legal consequences of civil disobedience in order to lend weight to one’s argument.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What you don’t want to do is behave the same way the others behave. If you’re gonna bring about change, you have to change yourself first,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You must only accept the consequences. That was the most important lesson I learned,” Lafayette said. “You have to be willing to accept the consequences when you refuse to obey an unjust law because the law is [supposed] to determine your behavior, but you make it ineffective when you ignore it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lafayette also described the need to appeal to the popular majority in order to secure civil rights gains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was Napoleon who said that no revolution has ever been won without the active support of the majority. Who do you think passed the Civil Rights Bill in Congress?” he asked the crowd. “There weren’t no Black elected officials to pass no bill. We were able to win them over.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the floor opened to questions, the audience honed in specifically on Lafayette’s relationship with the late King.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about his disagreements with King, Lafayette could only recall one — whether or not the Albany Movement to desegregate public spaces in Georgia was a success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“King believed that we failed, but my position was that no, we succeeded in the Albany Movement. Martin Luther King would always get involved in movements that had larger impact and bring about some national change or national legislation,” Lafayette said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might have resolved that if he lived.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked how he responded to the news of King’s death, Lafayette described how the tragedy reinstilled in him the drive to continue King’s work. Lafayette said he devoted his energy and attention to King’s broader long-term goal: to spread the practice of nonviolence across the globe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had to make a decision, with the news of his death … I decided to focus on the last words that King said to me: ‘We have got to internationalize and institutionalize nonviolence.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After King’s death, Lafayette returned to school to further educate himself on the law and the utility of nonviolence in social and political advocacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went to law school at Boston University because I wanted to think like a lawyer. I didn’t want to be a lawyer, but I wanted to think like a lawyer. Then I went to Harvard University to study nonviolence and education, and I got my master’s.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After college, he would continue to work as an activist for decades, becoming a distinguished authority on nonviolent strategies for social activism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with nonviolence, Lafayette said persistence is also a key ingredient in the making of a successful social movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You know, I was beaten in Selma, Alabama, the same night that Medgar Evers who was in the NAACP, in Mississippi, was shot and killed. And they planned to do the same thing to me the same night,” Lafayette said. “Fortunately, I survived that.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The FBI reported to me that [the Ku Klux Klan] had a plan to castrate me, to throw me in the river, and all that, you know. But fortunately I survived it,” he added. “ Don’t give up on the campaign, no matter what happens.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

To help students at UC Santa Barbara understand how the census works, U.S. Census Bureau Media Specialist Vanessa Moreno sat down with the Nexus to speak about how exactly collecting population data at UCSB and in I.V. works. Moreno specializes in dispelling misconceptions around the census and providing citizens a solid foundation for understanding how it works.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first U.S. Census was administered in 1790, and one has followed every 10 years since that time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The census also determines congressional apportionments for the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We allocate over $675 billion each year across the country for services … things that everyone’s going to use at one point or another. That’s why it’s really important to get a fair and accurate count of everyone,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of methods the U.S. Census Bureau employs to get an accurate count of the population, which depend on the living situation of those being counted. For those who live in residences such as houses or apartments, the occupants of each space are invited to respond to the census via the phone, mail or online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll send mail out invitation[s] to respond in mid-March. It’ll be a letter, and it will be addressed to the residence, not the residents, not the actual people living there,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, reminders will be sent to those who have not yet responded. If all else fails, an enumerator, a representative of the U.S. Census Bureau tasked with interviewing non-responses, will be sent to a residence in a last-ditch effort to obtain a proper count for the residence, according to Moreno. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get an accurate number of students living in residence halls or university apartments, the U.S. Census Bureau will instead contact the university directly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Any students that live in the dorms or student apartments don’t have to take the census themselves because we [have] already contacted or we are contacting [university] administrators and asking them how many people live there,” Moreno said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who do not have a permanent residence, census enumerators must take a more active role in obtaining a count. First, Moreno said, representatives will be sent to service-based localities such as soup kitchens or homeless shelters, where they will contact those who head those services to obtain a count of people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After, she said the U.S. Census Bureau will have people go to other locations, such as freeway underpasses or encampments, and do a physical count of how many people live there over a three-day period. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process takes months, and the results of the census are compiled and delivered to the president in December, with the results available to the public in early 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno also noted that those working with the U.S. Census Bureau must take an oath of confidentiality before carrying out any tasks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will never tell, for example, your landlord that you have more people living there than you should have. That’s not something we can or would do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take a lifetime oath to protect people’s information. And if we ever were to break that oath, we are subject to a $250,000 fine or five years in prison,” Moreno said. “So no one is too eager to break that oath.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno also addressed a point of controversy that has sparked criticism of the census in recent times. In </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/trump-census-citizenship-question.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Trump administration attempted to add a citizenship question to the census, but Moreno emphasized that the addition in question was struck down and will not be on the 2020 census.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no fear necessary when filling out the census,” Moreno said. “[People’s] information is safe and protected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because I.V. is a college town with residents who often move and may not be aware of how the census is carried out — or what relevance it has to their community— Moreno said there is some likelihood of an undercount.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreno went over a number of risk factors that could lead to this outcome, including the tendency for parents to include their children as residents in their household while the children are actually living at college, as well as resident fears that information obtained by the U.S. Census Bureau will be used against them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequences of an undercount are significant, Moreno said, noting it can result in inaccurate apportionment in the House of Representatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is the risk of California losing a seat in Congress,” Moreno said, adding that impacts to federal funding could also be severe, depending on the magnitude of the undercount.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Basically any social service that you can think of could be affected if people don’t make themselves count, and there’s no way to reassess the census once it’s been done until the next census,” Moreno said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is estimated that for every person that [isn’t counted] about $2,000 per year are lost from funding. Let’s say 100 people don’t answer. That’s like $200,000,” she said. “Then you multiply it by 10 years and it’s like $2 million.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

They drew feedback from students in order to figure out what undergraduates wanted to prioritize in the broad subject of human sexuality, whether it be sociology, relationships, sexually transmitted diseases or the physiology and anatomy of the human sexual response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Initially, we had some dead ends as we stumbled around, trying to figure out what to do. Eventually we came up with a questionnaire where [in] the last lecture every quarter, we would ask, ‘What would you like us to expand? What would you like to shrink down?’ Eventually everything started to stabilize out,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout this process, Soc 152A evolved to more heavily emphasize the subject of sexual health and the sociology of healthy relationships, while putting less time into anthropology and general biology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Students] aren’t that interested in sexual variations across different cultures,” Janice explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally thought the stuff was fascinating. We read so many studies in anthropology, and thought, ‘Oh my God! They do it so differently!’ I mean, every culture is filled with amazing examples of how different people treat sex and gender across the planet. We just got excited — but the students weren’t that interested,” John said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time in the early ‘70s, Soc 152A also grew into a much larger class, from 100 students to 150, before the Baldwins moved to Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall, teaching 300 students. Then finally, they made the leap to Campbell Hall — with its capability to shine enormous projections of the labia, the vas deferens, ejaculation and the female orgasm — all while lecturing to 600 to 650 students at once.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the decades of teaching the course, some subjects would vary from year to year, finding time in the limelight before dropping completely off the radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are fads, you know. There was a fad of changing the minor lips [of the labia], going through surgery to get them cosmetically changed. Now the big thing is they get implants in your butt. That’s bigger than breast implants,” Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Baldwins’ perspective, having two people onstage in Campbell Hall improves students’ understanding of concepts taught while also preventing students from misinterpreting what any one person says. After all, sexuality is a topic which can spur strong reactions and brings with it some baggage, Janice said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many people in the room that are sensitive to this. And I think if John said some of the things he says, and I wasn’t there, people could take it incorrectly,” Janice said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Soc 152A] does cover some delicate topics. We think it’s important to have tools so that people don’t think that John’s teaching this from a male perspective —”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“— or wonder whether Janice is a radical feminist,” John added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those issues don’t come up much when we’re doing it together,” Janice said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even in an era more liberal and open than when the class was initially taught, and even with the advent of the internet and online resources for sex education — which the Baldwins themselves have contributed to — the Baldwins still say there is still a place for Soc 152A.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a lot of people like international students … people from homes in which sex is not talked about, from very conservative backgrounds,” Janice said, adding that “it’s amazing how many people still benefit by taking Soc 152A.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Baldwins also found that in teaching a class like Soc 152A, their own relationship benefits.

Yang in 1998. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1998 demands called for the establishment of an LGBTQ+ resource center as well as a building in which to house the newly created organization and were meant to address the needs of LGBTQ+ students and provide more services and education, in addition to a space on campus for LGBTQ+ students. These demands ultimately resulted in the creation of the RCSGD in October 1999.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2017 demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> called for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) to be separate from the jurisdiction of the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department (WGSE) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stating that their umbrella organization did not treat them fairly </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the RCSGD’s programming budget to be doubled and for the designation of a freestanding building for the RCSGD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the demands called for a proper investigation into the circumstances surrounding Muro’s termination; the RCSGD and the WGSE disagreed about the extent of police presence during Muro’s firing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately, the RCSGD was removed from underneath the umbrella of the WGSE, and its programming budget was doubled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwayne Mosbey, the programming coordinator of the RCSGD, said the center has seen an almost sixfold increase in growth between Spring 2019 and Fall 2019. In addition, event attendance has doubled in the same timeframe across 72 programs, which he pointed to as a sign of the program’s expansion.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mosbey also discussed the RCSGD’s work in expanding its reach through collaborations with 22 various services and organizations, including Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), C</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ampus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) and the MultiCultural Center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What this implies is that our center now has connections all throughout campus. So for students who find some of these services that are inaccessible on their own, we’re able to connect them with those resources,” Mosbey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now two years later, with the majority of the 2017 demands met by the university, the largest and most costly demand is the last one left: the designation of a free-standing building for the RCSGD, which is currently housed in the Student Resource Building (SRB).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This was one demand put on the list that we discussed with students at the time was going to take a while and [there] would be a much longer process [to it] than the other ones,” said Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The discussion centered around how the RCSGD could go about either repurposing a building on campus, constructing a new building, creating multiple centers in various places in order to spread services across campus or even designate a location outside the bounds of the university in order to better serve members of the wider Goleta and Santa Barbara community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead suggested constructing a building to serve the aggregate needs of several organizations on campus. The Black Student Union has been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calling for</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a freestanding center for Black students on campus for over 50 years; in March 2019, Yang agreed to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide funding</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the creation of the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/inaugural-director-of-the-office-of-black-student-development-hired-fulfilling-bsu-demand/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office of Black Student Development</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and to make the standalone building a priority in campus planning efforts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have several groups, like the Office of Black Student Development, the Monarch Lounge; we’d like them to have some really nice space and then [it’d] probably be more cost effective to have another SRB for these groups.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead also discussed the possibility of establishing a location off-campus to serve as the RCSGD building, as well as potentially partnering with the Pacific Pride Foundation, an organization that provides “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provides services to the HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ+ communities of Santa Barbara County,” according to its </span><a href=\"https://pacificpridefoundation.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Craig Leets, the RCSGD director, said the center could also establish temporary spaces on campus, which could be used by the RCSGD to provide better accessibility to students living in the Chi-5 residence halls and the eastern ends of campus, near the engineering building, for example. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know when I first got here, we had been talking about Isla Vista as where we needed more space, but I’ve noticed that here we seem to have some claim on this side of campus [near the SRB]. But I wonder about the middle of campus where Chi-5 is, and then the other side of campus,” Leets said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, where the engineering buildings are, I went there for the first time this summer. So like a year into my job here, I had never been over to that side of campus. I think we’re trying to think about how we can have temporary space in those places.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexia Duran, a second-year undeclared student, suggested that the RCSGD allow students to have 24/7 access to the center “just for it to be a more accessible space for students,” citing the El Centro Arnulfo Casillas building.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“El Centro is open 24/7 and I’ve been there at 3 a.m. and I see people… [who] don’t have a house and students sometimes have to sleep on the couch. Having a space that would provide that for LGBTQ people would be necessary,” Duran said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said the RCSGD could also be moved into a number of soon-to-be-vacated sites closer to the center of campus, allowing for greater accessibility and interconnectedness with the Chi-5 dorms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a couple years down the road, but the university is in the process of moving some of the offices that are in the center of campus, and don’t need to be on the center of campus, off-campus. And that’s going to create some more space,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, several attendees objected to that idea, arguing that the buildings in that portion of campus were both old and in an undesirable state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You look at the Monarch Lounge, like it’s a pretty poor excuse for how we serve undocumented students. It’s a glorified portable, and relocating the RCSGD towards the center of campus will be probably within that space,” said Esmeralda Quintero, a third-year political science and sociology double major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead said that feasibility will be considered in the decision, but that support from students will be the deciding factor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not moving the RCSGD at all without student support,” Armistead said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we have an exact plan? No. However, things are moving because of new development that’s happening. And so starting to identify our needs now will serve us well so that we can slide in and start moving towards a space that is going to be open in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

movements, the widespread availability of psychedelics and other substances in the 1960s attracted the concern of governments worldwide, leading to the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970 and the further stigmatization of psychedelics in American culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ever since psychedelics were criminalized by Nixon around the early ‘70s, it’s been hard to use them in research or therapy,” Emily Gworek, fourth-year biopsychology major and cofounder of UCSB’s Psychedelic Club, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this is changing — the conversation and culture around psychedelics is beginning to shift, she emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the past couple of decades … people have been pushing those bureaucratic boundaries and working the drugs through clinical trials,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded by UCSB students Gworek, Surya Santhanam and Kristel Kerrigan, Psychedelic Club of UCSB aims to provide a space on campus to facilitate honest discussions about psychedelics.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first branch of Psychedelic Club was established at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2014. Psychedelic Club’s overarching mission is to “increase mainstream cultural awareness and acceptance of psychedelics,” according to a statement from its </span><a href=\"https://www.psychedeliclub.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On the very basic level, we want to be a safe space for people to come and talk about whatever interest they have in it. Bad or positive experiences, life-changing experiences. We want them to be able to connect with people about [psychedelics] and learn,” Kerrigan, a fourth-year biopsychology major, said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of us are biopsychology majors; we know how [psychedelics] work on your brain and how it affects your body. We want to actually inform people on that and actually talk about research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychedelic Club of UCSB is the first branch of Psychedelic Club in California and the 10th in the nation, with other branches located in Colorado, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maine, according to its website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek first became aware of Psychedelic Club while browsing research on the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (M.A.P.S.) website, stumbling upon a link to the organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She then reached out to Clayton Ickes, the vice president of Psychedelic Club at CU Boulder, and began discussions to establish a branch of Psychedelic Club at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, Gworek was starting to have conversations with other UCSB students surrounding their shared interest in psychedelics research. Over the summer, Gworek communicated with Santhanam over text, although they didn’t meet in person until the beginning of this school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two were intrigued by historical research into psychedelics, as well as the growing acceptance of psychedelics in present-day psychological research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We] see all this valid research — although most of it was done in the ‘60s before the giant ban on drugs,” Santhanam, a third-year psychological and brain sciences major, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were these incredible findings with people with terminal illnesses. Psychedelics had this capacity to help people accept death or change their attitudes toward death, which I think is phenomenal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research also indicated that psychedelics were effective in managing disorders like anxiety and depression and even had a degree of effectiveness when other medications weren’t working, according to Santhanam. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only recently have institutions began to address the subject of psychedelics on a large scale, Gworek said. In September, Johns Hopkins University opened a center for psychedelic research: The Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. Funded with $17 million from private donors, it is the first research institution of its kind in the United States and the largest of its kind in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“John Hopkins has opened their research center for psychedelics, which is amazing. I would love to be a part of that and get more labs open to that, although definitely something that needs to happen now is that [psychedelics research] needs to be more structured and have more direction,” Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santhanam, Gworek and Kerrigan were also interested in how the everyday person could benefit from psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics can allow even your average person to get new perspectives on life and it allows people to be really introspective and remind you how important it is to be present and intentional with the things that you do,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When a psychedelic is metabolizing the serotonin receptor, it seems to fire much faster and also can make parts of your brain interact that don’t normally communicate,” Santhanam added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Santhanam, psychedelics allow one to reexamine aspects of their life in manners which are difficult to perform without psychedelics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek, Santhanam and Kerrigan intend to use the club as a platform to inform people of the benefits and drawbacks to using psychedelics, as well as dispel common misconceptions regarding psychedelics and how they compare to other drugs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Psychedelics are not the go-to drugs for most people. You’d be surprised by how many people may have heard about it but don’t even know what a psychedelic is,” Santhanam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the near future, Psychedelic Club would like to bring speakers and advocacy organizations to campus, such as EntheoMedicine, as well as host risk management events in the style of The Zendo Project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EntheoMedicine people are the people that kind of guide you through your trip and they host events in other countries where it’s legal, and they’re kind of guides when you’re on it. They said they’d be interested, and that they really want to talk to young people, Kerrigan said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Zendo Project is a program associated with M.A.P.S., which provides psychedelic harm reduction to those at festivals, concerts and other events where psychedelic substances may be used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re at a festival and you’re using psychedelics and things get weird and you’re uncomfortable and you’re anxious and you’re overwhelmed because you’re surrounded by thousands of people and pounding music, they provide a safe space where you can go,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have therapists who are trained to deal with people having a difficult psychedelic experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek plans to host a psychedelic harm reduction event in the same vein to teach people about risk management, how to best navigate bad trips and, beyond that, what to learn from difficult trips.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If something goes wrong like that, that’s an anxiety that a lot of people have about using psychedelics. It’d be nice to educate people on how to best handle those kinds of situations,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But above all else, the priority of Psychedelic Club is to start the conversation about psychedelic use. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping the club will just be a place where people who are interested in psychedelics or psychedelic research or just the psychedelic experience in general … can just kind of congregate and have those discussions,” Gworek said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the Oct. 31, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

This was quickly followed by a second sighting near Devereux Lagoon on West Campus the next day; the following morning, Sept. 19, a sighting near West Campus was reported again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were then no sightings for almost three weeks until Oct. 7, when UCSB students Dulce Simental and Monica Lopez spotted a large and “very built” animal fleeing on all fours while the two were watching the sunset below the Campus Point bluffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Molly Hardesty-Moore, a researcher associated with the McCauley Lab at UCSB who focuses on urban and carnivore ecology, sat down with the Nexus to discuss the likely origins of the mountain lion, as well as the implications of repeat sightings so close to civilization.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardesty-Moore pointed to two possible scenarios: the mountain lion may have come to campus by following the coast, approaching from the relatively undeveloped north, or it may have come to campus from the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains by crossing the 101 Freeway and crossing a number of human settlements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I got out Google Maps as soon as I heard about this. I was like, ‘How the heck would this guy get here?’ We’re surrounded by the 101 and the 217. Even going along the coast there’s sporadic houses and ranches,” Hardesty-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it went from Campus Point to Devereux, it wouldn’t go through Isla Vista without being sighted, so it seems like it went along the beach during low tide, if that’s possible. It’s also possible it came in along the coast originally.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the mountain lion was confined to small strips of coast and navigated these spaces using the beaches to avoid humans, it would be difficult for it to sustain itself, as its primary food source is deer, which can’t be found in the immediate coastal area, she noted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Lions] do eat raccoons as a secondary food source, and we do have a decent amount of racoons,” Hardesty-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> She added, however, that she is unsure how easy it would be for a mountain lion to switch to a prey source it is not used to; as part of her research, she monitors the movement of racoons throughout campus and the greater urban environment with GPS collars and has not come across evidence to suggest that a mountain lion is hunting the racoons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also unlikely that a mountain lion would willfully return to campus after hunting elsewhere unless it had to, she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it has a good route to go up the coast through the beach, maybe it is going up and then feeling pressure to come back for whatever reason, but I would more expect that it’s stuck here. If it could leave in a good way, it would, and it wouldn’t come back,” Hardesty-Moore said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One possibility is that conflict from another mountain lion is compelling this one to linger near the coast. Mountain lions are territorial predators who need a lot of land, so juvenile males may find themselves inadvertently encroaching on urban spaces to avoid conflict with other more established adults, she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems probable that the one sighted could be a young male, since they tend to be the ones that disperse. I don’t know why it would be returning [to campus areas] unless it were being driven away by an aggressive older male, since they’re really territorial,” Hardesty-Moore said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mountain lions are wide-ranging species, and when they get old enough, they disperse. It’s sort of a normal thing for them to start seeking new spaces, although it’s not as normal to get into human spaces.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A human stressor may also be a culprit. Mountain lions throughout California are victims of intense habitat fragmentation and can become cut off from one another. This is especially true in coastal Southern California, where the urban landscape is sprawling and extensive, save for pockets of land along the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, according to Hardesty-Moore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Mountain lions are] really bad at crossing roads and being around people because we just tend to get rid of them. Southern California is just full of people,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, UCSB’s campus and Devereux Lagoon are a far cry from untouched, and the presence of comparatively high-quality open space in the hills across the 101 Freeway make it difficult to entertain the notion that a mountain lion would flee to the coast in search of better habitat, Hardesty-Moore explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hardesty-Moore, mountain lions are only known to attack humans in extreme circumstances, but students should still exercise caution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s a big predator. That is something to be mindful of. If it’s scared or hungry or lost, that could make the situation worse, but it’s almost always really extreme circumstances </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— [if] </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the mountain lion is starving, for example. Usually they don’t want anything to do with people,” Hardesty-Moore said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’ve ever been out hiking in the hills, odds are that a mountain has seen you do that. But it doesn’t want you, it doesn’t need you. It doesn’t want human prey. You’re just trouble for them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardesty-Moore and Peter Alagona, an associate professor in history and environmental studies, plan to meet with the UC Police Department, state and federal government officials and fellow scholars in early November to discuss “mountain lions, public safety, and wildlife coexistence on the UCSB campus,” Alagona said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Hardesty-Moore, the recent sightings give the community a chance to better understand the natural world which surrounds campus and how it can intersect with civilization — sometimes in messy ways.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s a good opportunity to think ‘Oh my gosh, these creatures are actually really close to us.’ They live right around us and sometimes they come around here, and we need to think about how to coexist with them and figure out problems like this when they happen.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

transitioning into having full voting power during his second year. </span><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil will join the current regent designate, UC San Diego doctoral student Hayley Weddle, in serving on the Regents board if he is approved at the July meeting. He will serve alongside Weddle when she succeeds the current student regent, UC Los Angeles doctoral student Devon Graves, for this upcoming year; following Weddle’s term, Muwwakkil will take over and serve as the voting regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents is comprised of</span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/about/members-and-advisors/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 26 appointed and ex-officio members </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that govern the UC system. The UC student regent is a full-voting regent of the University of California and the only voting member on the board who is required to be a student at one of the UC campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only real differences [between student regents and other appointed regents] is that they are closer to the student population, both in age and geographic proximity. The idea is that they might be able to leverage the student voice and kind of contextualize the policy decisions that are being made,” Muwwakkil said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil will spend the first year of his two-year term learning the ropes of the position before transitioning into having full voting power during his second year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The first year, you’re participating in all of the committee meetings and going to all of the talks, but you’re not voting — you’re functionally shadowing the student regent who’s appointed in their second year of the position,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A record 113 UC students applied for the position of the 2020-21 student regent, </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-student-regent-nominated-2019-20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compared to 40 who applied in the cycle before</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Muwwakkil attributes this to the previous student regents’ efforts to publicize the position and inform students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Regent Graves and Regent Weddle made a point to visit all of the campuses and to market the position space… and encouraging a lot of folks who would not have applied otherwise to engage in the process,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a member of the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA) at UCSB and a first-generation transfer student, Muwwakkil said he took notice of the lack of representation of students of color, and more specifically, nontraditional students of color, in student governance and higher education in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the ways Muwwakkill addressed this issue was by helping to revive UCSB’s BGSA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Myself and a lot of other graduate students of color found that our numbers are quite low. We decided to… revitalize the existing infrastructure of the Black Graduate Student Association of UCSB,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil worked with David Stamps, a doctoral student in the Department of Communications, to reestablish the BGSA, and eventually served as the second BGSA president during the 2017-18 academic year. During this time, he began to look for more avenues to expand his advocacy work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually, he reasoned the best way to make an impact while fulfilling his academic commitments was by serving as student regent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil initially applied for the position during the last application cycle but was passed over for Weddle. He will now be shadowing her as regent designate next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muwwakkil said Weddle focuses on advocating for the “basic rights of students” like “food insecurity, housing security, accessibility” as well as on other issues like Title IX regulations and sexual violence on college campuses.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Weddle’s platform, Muwwakkil plans to bring attention to the challenges faced by nontraditional students.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As we engage with leadership from each campus, we also have to be intentional to engage with students whose perspectives may very well not be represented by their leadership,” Muwwakkil said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Society does] this thing where we kind of focus in on like the 18-year-old, [and say] ‘Be stellar at 18 or no UC for you.’ I think this is a problem because there’s a lot of living that people do between the age of 18 and retirement. We need to validate the experiences of non-traditional students … within the classroom,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a transfer student from Los Angeles City College, Muwwakkil said his experience has shaped his views about accessibility for nontraditional students navigating higher education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re [a] first-generation student going through college, there’s a lot of guesswork that happens … You’re confused about the process, what it means to apply,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As regent designate, Muwwakkil said he first hopes to educate himself on the operations and inner workings of the Board of Regents and maneuvering the system, as well as pressing issues within the system and how these relate to students and their success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m going to be doing a lot of fact finding and understanding what are the actual mechanisms by which things are done and accomplished; what are the prominent issues facing the UC and how the students build on their local campus level and the larger system,” Muwwakkil said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his tenure as student regent, Muwwakkil said he hopes to further the UC system’s aim in cultivating an environment that is conducive to the success of all students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Are there ways that all of these different types of students can engage in the huge bureaucracy that is the university? If that’s true for some and not for others, then we have some work to do.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-86937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The movement held a protest on March 15 involving the Youth Climate Strike. <em>Courtesy of Reena Nanavati</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GND intends to massively invest in clean energy and infrastructure, transforming the American economy and decarbonizing the energy sector, according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposed bill</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a representative for New York’s 14th congressional district, proposed the program in February 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB students Rose Strauss, Maithilee Kanthi and Claire Muñoz established Sunrise SB in January 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three have since coordinated with organizations such as the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 and the United States Youth Climate Strike, as well as elected officials such as U.S. Congressman Salud Carbajal and California State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall opened with statements from County Supervisor Das Williams and Wendy Motta, a spokesperson for Carbajal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lead co-author of the Senate Bill 350 Clean Energy &amp; Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, Williams commended California for revamping its energy sector even as the country has stagnated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[California is] massively decarbonizing our energy sector. We’re getting better at using solar and other alternatives. However, the urgency of the situation is real, because even as California and some other states have moved forward, the country has not,” Williams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motta emphasized Carbajal’s enthusiasm for the GND.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was impressed by the aggressive agenda. He called Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and told her that he would like to be an original co-sponsor of the measure,” Motta said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the opening statements, the floor was opened for questions. The panel of four speakers included first-year environmental studies major Elena Salinas O’Toole, fourth-year sociology major Daniel Berchenko, Santa Barbara co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Per Kristian and campaign manager for Jill Stein during the 2012 presidential election and UCSB sociologist Ben Manski. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They addressed questions regarding how common citizens could become involved in the movement, the subject of reparations, the specific policies of the GND and its intersectional nature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manski elaborated on how the different approaches to the GND come together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s the liberal version which is technocratic, and focuses on a technological shift, there’s the progressive version which in my mind is the one that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done such a great job of articulating, which deals with the need to transition economically, and focuses on specific industries, and then there’s the green party one, which is systemic reform,” Manski said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manski emphasized the necessity of voting rights and election reform in order to democratize the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristian then highlighted the GND’s approach to mobilizing disenfranchised workers in middle America, similar to the original New Deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can you think of a better way to get working people on board than putting people to work doing the work that we need to do to … rebuild our environment?” Kristian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Berchenko spoke on the technological feasibility of the GND and how solutions already exist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The technological fixes have existed for decades. We know that we have the solar capacity, the wind capacity, the hydroelectric capacity to transition from carbon. We know that we have the alternative technologies that we’re going to need to do this. The only thing that we seem to be lacking is the political will,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of particular significance to Salinas O’Toole is the stance that the GND takes with regard to wilderness and open spaces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I grew up in DC and there we have Rock Creek Park which is polluted and disgusting and for most people that’s the only nature that they’ve ever been exposed to. It’s gotten to the point where, in our society, it’s a privilege to have access to wilderness and I think that’s intrinsically wrong,” Salinas O’Toole said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that is at the core of not understanding what’s at stake and preventing the people’s movement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel went on to describe how one could become involved in activism and grassroots movements to avoid succumbing to despair and apathy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of that is find a group. Don’t sit at home scrolling through Facebook reading about walruses throwing themselves off of cliffs … it’s a never-ending stream of negativity and you’re just gonna spiral down a hole,” Kristian said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salinas O’Toole emphasized the necessity of having organizations that listen to youth and give them a voice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That was something that I was battling with a lot. I’d go to protests and I felt like I was super involved, but then there’d be this huge lack of response. Having platforms for young people to take hold of this issue that is affecting our generation more than any other generation is critical I think,” Salinas O’Toole said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the conclusion of the town hall, members in the audience were asked what they hoped would come out of the GND; people listed water use regulations, job guarantees, environmentally friendly investment opportunities and improvements in air quality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Berchenko said the two sides in the debate are not conflicts between urban and rural or liberals and conservatives, but rather the common person and corporate interests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In Santa Barbara county there are five major oil projects going on right now. They are rebuilding the Plains All American Pipeline which spilled in 2015, on the same route, right next to it,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s the people that are actually working that are being affected and that are going to be harmed by environmental issues, versus the small number of corporations and executives that are polluting the world. We can trace 70% of all emissions, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, to 108 companies, 100 of which are still in operation. It’s always been the same people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Berchenko is hopeful about Sunrise Movement SB and the chance for change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of what’s exciting about Sunrise and what’s exciting about the opportunity that’s presented to us now is that a large number of very young people are getting involved in this for what’s potentially the first time. They were really galvanized by the 2016 election and by the political climate that we’re starting to see now,” Berchenko said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m excited about the history that it invokes and what it could be.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of the UCSB Black studies department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biography is the culmination of decades of work, Stewart said in an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart began research on Locke in 1977 while in graduate school at Yale University. He dropped the project for a long period of time but resumed writing the biography in 1992.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I went away from it because it was so challenging … It was a very complex project. I didn’t feel like early on, coming out of graduate school, I could write the book. I had to grow as a writer,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart made use of Howard University’s exhaustive collection of Locke’s personal correspondences to paint a picture of Locke’s philosophy, life experiences, conflicts and interpersonal relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professor at Howard University, Locke left the bulk of his letters with the institution, where they were compiled in the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart pored over thousands of documents in the process of writing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He has voluminous letters. He had probably 5000 letters to his mother alone… He would report on what he did and where he went almost like a diary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike historical counterparts such as Booker T. Washington or W. E. B. Du Bois, who focused on social advancement through economic efficacy and protest respectively, Locke looked at the arts and saw an opportunity to connect white audiences with Black creators, Stewart said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s like a facilitator. He’s like a producer of these things. He did it out of a belief that art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke popularized the works of Black artists and authors such as Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and others who “started doing poems and short stories and novels about the Black experience,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that “art was a way to advance the situation of race relations more positively than through other avenues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Almost like a Trojan Horse, [art] could be rode into the citadel of American culture and there would be poetry and art and all about Black people which would humanize how people thought about Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke faced challenges relating to his disposition, his size, his sexuality and his focus on art over other forms of activism. In the greater Black cultural narrative, Stewart believes Locke was overlooked because of these peculiarities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take somebody like Frederick Douglass. He’s independent, a leader, a spokesperson. He’s heterosexual, he has a family. It’s like it’s the mirror of the white world, but Black. Locke was small. He was 4’11″. He weighed 99 pounds. He was into art, which is not typically the focus of Black politics. He was a difficult personality.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke’s challenges gave him a unique perspective on life, and his success and resilience in the face of dismissiveness from other activists inspired Stewart.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He never let the opposition from other people stop him, whether it was gendered or sexual, or racial, or even the issue of his size, or those people who thought that art was ridiculous to be concerned about when you’re in the midst of a racial struggle.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87719\" style=\"width: 345px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1536383264\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87708\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87719\" data-attachment-id=\"87719\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/ucsb-professor-wins-pulitzer-prize/unnamed-1-28/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"335,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?fit=335%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87719\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=335%2C508\" alt=\"\" width=\"335\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?w=335&amp;ssl=1 335w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-87719\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of the UCSB Black studies department</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also significant to Stewart was Locke’s faith in the Black cultural capacity for change and reinvention, away from the ideals and standards imposed by white people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locke believed that in altering one’s conception of oneself and embracing one’s innate qualities as a Black person, one could “acquire and gain a sense of self-esteem and agency that [one could] never acquire by trying to get what the other people have,” Stewart said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So there’s a narrative of self-sufficiency and self-determination through art.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke also led a life of lonesomeness which intensified after the death of the most prominent figure in Locke’s life: his mother.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Much of his life was after her death in 1922, a search for someone to replace her… and he never found that,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was coupled with a desire for a meaningful relationship with a man, which Locke could never fulfill, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He had relationships but never anything that was really permanent. He felt people would get with him because of what he could do for them, they used him. He was a means, not an end.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Locke was a perpetual optimist deep down, even in his dying moments. In every aspect of his life, whether it be romantic pursuits, academic ambitions or social activism, Locke never let seemingly insurmountable disadvantages discourage him, Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stewart believes young people can learn from Locke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That kind of relates to today, I think. A lot of young people come out and look at the situation. There’s a lot of controversy… but [Locke] was always hopeful, always thinking that by contributing you could make a difference.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This signature concept of</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The New Negro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that Black people reinvented themselves in the 20th century, away from slavery… There’s this idea that wherever you are in your life, whatever has happened, you still have the capacity for a new version of yourself,” Stewart said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His whole thing is, well, if you believe you can change, then maybe you can.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

id=\"caption-attachment-82096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SB 461 will provide up to nine units of financial aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant. <em>Will Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>In its current iteration, Senate Bill 461 (SB 461) will provide up to nine units of aid per session to students eligible for Cal Grant, and would be valid for four-year students for two summer sessions, and valid to transfer students for one summer session.</p>\n<p>Generally, summer sessions are six weeks long, shorter than the standard 10 week quarter.</p>\n<p>“There are a couple changes this year, but it doesn’t have to do with the bill, it has to do with the climate,” Kuvimbinashe “Eddy” Chikukwa, chair for Coalition for a Better UC, said.</p>\n<p>He cited the election of California Governor Gavin Newsom as a reason for why the bill may pass this time.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom is] more favorable towards funding higher education… and really willing to reform the Cal Grant system in a way that we did not see last year.”</p>\n<p>Newsom, who previously sat on the UC Board of Regents, has been much more receptive to suggestions compared to former governor Jerry Brown, who had “a very antagonistic position with regards to the UC,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>“[Newsom] got to hear a lot of the complaints people had, and he got to hear a lot of the solutions people had regarding this issue… Gavin understands that you need to fund higher education so that students have adequate aid to get out faster.”</p>\n<p>Alongside the bill, students are pushing for a budget request to ensure that money is allocated specifically for summer aid.</p>\n<p>“Last year, a lot of people were hesitant to support it because if the bill were passed it would be drawn from the general fund, and there were concerns that this money could be taken from other students,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>SB 461 has drawn more support and grown a larger coalition of interest groups that are invested in reforming Cal Grant. The University of California Office of the President (UCOP) is co-sponsoring the bill, while the CSU Chancellor’s Office and the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) are also in support of it.</p>\n<p>“There is also the will to reform Cal Grant. There is an actual desire which is evidenced by the recent assembly,” Chikukwa said, in reference to the joint legislative hearing chaired by California State Assembly Members José Medina and Kevin McCarty on Feb. 6, where “Closing the Degree Gap” was discussed.</p>\n<p>Regarding the necessity of summer aid for eligible students, Chikukwa noted the projected deficit of college graduates by 2030.</p>\n<p>“We’re acknowledging the fact that there’s a 1.1 million college graduate deficit that’s going to happen, we’re acknowledging the fact that low-income students tend to be the ones who don’t graduate on time, and we’re acknowledging the fact that we need more of these students to graduate faster.”</p>\n<p>Chikukwa also noted how S.T.E.M. students, who don’t necessarily always pass their major classes, often must resort to taking summer classes.</p>\n<p>Another issue which arises is that major classes during the year are often overenrolled.</p>\n<p>“So the state is making us enroll all these students into these courses and we don’t have space to put you in right now, so the best option is summer, and the state is making the UC do this and not providing summer aid, which is problematic,” Chikukwa said.</p>\n<p>The bill has a long way to go, however.</p>\n<p>“We just introduced it, this is still the ‘hip hip hurrah’ phase.”</p>\n<p>In order to become law, SB 461 must make it through the Senate Education Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate floor. Then, after this, it must go through the California State Assembly.</p>\n<p>However, Chikukwa is optimistic.</p>\n<p>“It was really scrutinized heavily last year. A lot of people looked at it and they made their suggestions, and so this year I haven’t heard too many objections because the final objection last year was the lack of a budget request.

Biology is something that students see in high school, they already have an exposure to it,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>Stopple acknowledged the tendency for biology majors to declare the major with a pre-med track in mind, only to realize how overwhelming the major can be later on.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes [they switch out] because their grades were not good enough to get into medical school. They think ‘well if I’m not going to be a doctor then, I don’t want to do biology after all,’” Stopple said.</p>\n<p>The <em>Daily Nexus</em> reached out to students to gain insight on their perspectives regarding the department of biological sciences at UCSB, and found several recurring complaints.</p>\n<p>While it is to be expected that S.T.E.M. majors be rigorous and require strong academic engagement, many students expressed frustration with the difficulty of prerequisite classes, as well as an initial lack of emphasis on biology during the foundational coursework.</p>\n<p>“A lot of Bio students come in unsuspecting of how difficult the gen chem series is, especially resenting it because they’re not interested in studying chem in the first place, or necessarily good at it,” second-year pre-biology major Aja Whitehead said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students found that the administrators and advisors were at best overburdened and at worst outright unhelpful.</p>\n<p>“The school would probably like to think that the major is hard and that’s why people are dropping it, but in all honesty I think the lack of support from the department itself plays a larger role,” Aidan, a fourth-year biology major who declined to give their last name, said.</p>\n<p>“I’ve had great professors, but the advisors and administrators have never been helpful to me.”</p>\n<p>Olivia, a fourth-year aquatic biology major who asked that her last name not be used, expressed similar discontent with advisors who she felt encouraged her to take an excessive course load during her first quarter after transferring to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I really do feel that students look to the advisors for guidance and help with structuring their plans here and they do not provide that,” Olivia said.</p>\n<p>Ivan, a fourth-year biology major who asked that his last name not be used, was among a group of about 20 undergraduate molecular, cellular and developmental biology (MCDB) students who were part of an external review committee. The committee invites other faculty from universities around the west coast to evaluate the department, gather input from students and make recommendations.</p>\n<p>“The complaints against the Bio department were pretty strong… comments ranged from poor class structures during the first two years all the way to a deficit advisory team,” Ivan said.</p>\n<p>However, members of the faculty have coordinated with students in attempts to raise retention rates. Mike Wilton and Eduardo Gonzalez, two lecturers in the MCDB department, have worked to make more resources available to incoming freshmen who declare as pre-biology majors.</p>\n<p>Associated Students On-Campus Senator Yash Nagpal has also been collaborating with Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) — alongside Wilton and Gonzalez — in an attempt to improve the situation.</p>\n<p>“[Wilton and Gonzalez] introduced the mentoring series MCDB 11, 12 and 13, which are to be taken in conjunction with the gen chem series,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>MCDB 11, 12 and 13 serve as chemistry support classes, so one can establish a community of like-minded peers with who to study and hold each other accountable. For classes like the general chemistry series which lack a section, Nagpal believes that these provide a more collaborative and intimate setting.</p>\n<p>“Having these support programs that [Wilton and Gonzalez] create is essential to student success,” Nagpal said. “They see that students who take MCDB 11, 12 and 13… these students specifically have higher retention rates in the pre-biology major.”</p>\n<p>EOP students are a demographic which leave the biology major at a much higher rate than the general student body, Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>“Low-income students have to work for college compared to their more-privileged peers… because of this they can’t devote as much attention to their academics,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Nagpal is advocating for the expansion of financial support to more EOP-eligible students, which he hopes will alleviate some of this financial stress.</p>\n<p>“EOP has an emergency grant alongside A.S., and as a senator I have taken it upon myself to work with the director of EOP, Aaron Jones, to revise the A.S. EOP grant and essentially expand this,” Nagpal said.</p>\n<p>Although a consensus from students is relatively easy to find just by surveying the academic body, extensive qualitative information regarding the “why” of switching majors has not been compiled.</p>\n<p>“I’d love to have more data in many ways, and know more about the process by which students change majors. We could do better generally, as a campus, in collecting data,” Stopple said.</p>\n<p><i>Updated [9:46 p.m.]</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.

Then once it passed a certain size, other people were like, ‘Oh, this is for everyone,’ and they felt more welcome to post,” Truong said.</p>\n<p>From the start, the page grew quickly.</p>\n<p>“It didn’t take long at all; we advertised it immediately on the other memes page, so everyone just came over,” Vu said.</p>\n<p>“It was like a snowball effect; even people from other schools wanted to join,” Ocampo added.</p>\n<p>The admins found that certain periods of the quarter, like midterm season, saw peaks in activity   because a lot of people were going through the same hardships that come with being a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>“More people are likely to complain about the same thing, and because of that people are able to relate to [Overheard at UCSB] more, which contributes to the popularity,” Chen said.</p>\n<p>Overheard at UCSB quickly adopted a unique flavor in line with the campus itself and the community of I.V.</p>\n<p>“Each Overheard page has its own culture that kind of, like, reflects the culture of the college … at UCSB it’s kind of like a bit [of a] party school. You hear a lot of really inappropriate pieces of conversation,” Chen said.</p>\n<p>While Overheard at UCSB has grown organically with its community, the admins have had to exercise judgment in moderating content from certain users who have tried to hijack the page to sell products or simply commandeer the group.</p>\n<p>“There are rules in place for a reason. Sometimes people try to make it their own page … it’s not ‘Overheard from Someone Else,’ it’s Overheard at UCSB, and we want it to be about the campus, not a specific person,” Ocampo said.</p>\n<p>“There was a person on Overheard who posted multiple times a day, so we checked him out, and he doesn’t even go here. He, like, looked up facts to make the posts more relatable, and then he tried to sell them on apparel. We’ve blocked him twice,” Vu said.</p>\n<p>Still, the admins believe that the page has flowered into a thriving community.</p>\n<p>“I think, as long as people are willing to share their experiences, Overheard at UCSB has a place,” Chen said.</p>\n<p><em>Sean Crommelin is a copy editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 14, 2019 of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_2674.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/sean-crommelin/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Sean Crommelin</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Sean Crommelin is the Science and Tech Editor for the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.
