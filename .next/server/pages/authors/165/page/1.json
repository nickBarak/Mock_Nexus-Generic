As part of their campaign, the students are collecting pictures, inspirational quotes and personal stories from UCSB students and sharing them on their website and Facebook page.</p>\n<p>Campaign organizer and fourth-year theater major Fangyuan Liu said the group plans to combine a strong social media presence with an on-campus campaign to spread the message.</p>\n<p>“We are going to share their [the students’] stories and quotes on Facebook, make their quotes into flyers and distribute them to different departments and boards on campus,” Liu said in an email. “Also, we are going make a big presentation board and we are going to present it on the lawn by Pardall tunnel.”</p>\n<p>Campaign organizer and fourth-year psychology major Yasmin Irfani said sharing students’ stories on social media allows more people to see them.</p>\n<p>“Our main idea is the website and Facebook page because that’s what most students look at,” Irfani said. “They can see people’s stories and think, ‘Oh, I’ve seen this person on campus I didn’t know they felt this way.’”</p>\n<p>According to Irfani, the campaign is meant to send positive messages to students who are discouraged from visiting Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and other resources aimed to help those with mental illness.</p>\n<p>“This is what we wanted to do because we believe that every student should feel comfortable walking into CAPS knowing that it’s OK to feel however they’re feeling. We wanted to help them feel validated,” Irfani said.</p>\n<p>Liu said stigmas surrounding mental illness are problematic because they prevent students from seeking counseling and she hopes the campaign changes people’s attitudes to “normalizing instead of stigmatizing.”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes people may not want to share their troubles with loved ones, perhaps in the fear of being a burden on them,” Liu said in an email. “Talking to a professional psychologist can give a person a different perspective and counselors are able to offer people non-judgmental and professional help to guide them through their difficult times.”</p>\n<p>Third-year biopsychology major and campaign participant Suman Sidhu said she is in support of the project because it will allow students to feel more comfortable reaching out for help.</p>\n<p>“People refuse to view mental health as something that needs to be prioritized, especially on college campuses where so many students struggle with such things,” Sidhu said in an email. “I love this project because it approves that none of us is alone when it comes to having struggles, it is very easy to look around and think you are the only one going through difficult times.”</p>\n<p>Sidhu said she sought out counseling for her anxiety but wished she could have been more informed about mental health resources sooner.</p>\n<p>“Personally I struggle with anxiety and have found CAPS to be extremely helpful,” Sidhu said in an email. “I was one of those people that felt skeptical about counseling and therapy, but I wish I had been educated about it way earlier in life. Everyone should feel comfortable walking into that pink building and asking for help.”</p>\n<p>Campaign organizer and second-year philosophy major Brianna Taylor said she is pleased with the number of online submissions since she expected a low turnout due to the strong negative stigma surrounding mental illness.</p>\n<p>“I guess I thought the stigma around this topic was so high that I anticipated a lower turn-out, but it’s great to see the reality of the situation,” Taylor said in an email “I hope we are making a difference by putting a local, friendly face next to optimism and words about normalizing mental health.”</p>\n<p>Campaign organizer and fourth-year psychology major Juan Salinas said due to the unexpected success of the project, the campaign may continue beyond this quarter.</p>\n<p>“As far as the course assignment goes, once the quarter is over it’s over and we don’t have to do anything with it,” said Salinas, “But we think it actually has potential to continue on, so we’re going to build it up as much as we can until then, and offer it up to anyone willing to continue it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

York City, where they won the Outstanding Delegation award for the second year in a row<em>. Benjamin Pu/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Model United Nations (MUN) won an Outstanding Delegation award for the second year in a row while representing Kuwait and Luxembourg at the National Model U.N. conference in New York last Thursday.</p>\n<p>The 22 members of UCSB MUN spent a little over one academic quarter preparing for the conference, at which they were split into pairs to represent a specific country, sit on various committees with different aims and write up legislation to combat various issues. A majority of the team represented Kuwait, and one pair represented Luxembourg in the Security Council. Over 150 schools and nearly 3,000 people attended the event, which took place from March 29 to April 2.</p>\n<p>Third-year political science and economics double major Jesse Lin said pairs worked together and used current events and the political history of their country to debate and write legislation to resolve present-day issues.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we try to come up with a resolution to solve these problems that the U.N. is facing currently in each of these committees,” Lin said.</p>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major and MUN delegate Benjamin Pu, the Outstanding Delegation award is only given to the top ten percent of participating schools.</p>\n<p>“This is our second year in a row winning it so we’re now established as a good model U.N. school,” Pu said. “If you win once at nationals it might be a fluke, but when you win twice in a row it’s definitely a powerhouse school.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Zeina Rousan said leadership skills shown by individuals on the team greatly contributed to the team’s success.</p>\n<p>“Almost every single person on the team was able to lead a working group; that’s probably why we ended up winning outstanding,” Rousan said. “We each practiced so much, knew so much information about these topics and were trained to be good diplomats that we were able to take all these people competing with us and have them want to work with us and have us lead in writing these resolutions.”</p>\n<p>According to Lin, receiving outstanding delegation was a great accomplishment for the team and reflected the team’s hard work despite the large number of new members.</p>\n<p>“This year with a bigger team it’s really hard to manage, but everyone really tried,” Lin said. “Everyone worked really hard and researched a lot. There was a lot of outside research that they needed to do, and we ended up doing really well even though we had a lot of first-years who hadn’t done this before.”</p>\n<p>According to Pu, many of the members of the team also received individual recognition at the conference.</p>\n<p>“A couple of us took home position paper awards, and a couple of us took home delegate awards for doing the best in committee as well,” Pu said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Paul Krausse said visiting the United Nations headquarters was a memorable experience.</p>\n<p>“As a fourth-year but just a first-year in Model U.N., I felt somewhat intimidated by it but it was really great; we got to go to the U.N. headquarters in New York and that was an incredible experience, walking into Grand Hall was unbelievable,” Krausse said. “For anyone who was in Model U.N. it’s kind of like going to the holy grail of the U.N. That was such an incredible experience.”</p>\n<p>According to Lin, a big part of the conference involved networking with people from all over the world and having their legislations recognized.</p>\n<p>“You get to meet a lot of new people in these conferences. You’re not only working together — you’re making friends,” Lin said. “At the end of the day you get to see your work posted on the website, and it makes you feel like you’ve really done something to mitigate these problems.”</p>\n<p>Krausse said faculty advisor for UCSB MUN Galen Stocking contributed greatly to the team, and recently moved to a new position at the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. after working with MUN for the past three years.</p>\n<p>“Galen’s contributions to the UCSB Model U.N. team are unbelievable, and I don’t know where UCSB Model U.N. would be without him,” Krausse said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The second annual Dance Marathon took place on campus on Saturday night at Pavilion Gym to raise money for the Santa Barbara Cottage Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>Dance Marathon raised a total of $35,347.11 for Cottage Hospital, the local chapter of Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, and exceeded its fundraising goal of $25,000. Each of 38 dance teams represented one patient from Cottage Hospital and entered after meeting the minimum entry requirements. To celebrate the funds they raised, participants engaged in a 12-hour-long dance party from noon until midnight, partaking in activities, entertainment and free food from local businesses such as Panda Express, Sorriso Italiano and Silvergreens.</p>\n<p>Event co-chair and alumnus Sean Thompson said Dance Marathon will continue to host the event in an effort to increase their fundraising goals. This year’s raised amount surpassed last year’s total of $12,791.84.</p>\n<p>“We up the ante every year,” Thompson said. “This year our goal was to double the fundraising, double the amount of people and next year, who knows?”</p>\n<p>According to co-chair of Dance Marathon and fourth-year biological science major Molly Morrison, about 400 participants raised money, an increase from last year’s 200 participants. Morrison said this is indicative of an upward trend in participation she hopes to continue.</p>\n<p>“This is the second annual event and we’re hoping to continue for generations and generations,” Morrison said. “Children’s Miracle Network nationally reached out to the UCSB campus as they were looking to extend their reach on the west coast. They came to UCSB and we’re here now.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said Dance Marathon began in 1991 at Indiana University in honor of Ryan White, a student who was expelled from his middle school in 1984 after being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. The event was then adopted by Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. According to Morrison, dance marathons are now held on over 250 campuses nationwide with participants staying and dancing for a full 12 hours without sitting down to show support for hospitalized children.</p>\n<p>“Essentially we are standing for the kids that can’t,” Morrison said. “The people who really want to stay for the kids stay the whole time.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61465\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61465\" data-attachment-id=\"61465\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/dance-marathon-members-engaged-in-a-zumba-session/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=1067%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1067,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Dance marathon members engaged in a Zumba session\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425082645\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"Dance marathon members engaged in a Zumba session\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance marathon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61465\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=400%2C600\" alt=\"Dance marathon members engaged in a Zumba session.

We can get together and feel like we can help donate and have a good time together at the same time.”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_61473\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"216681619\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"61497\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61473\" data-attachment-id=\"61473\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-02/dancers-boogie-for-12-hours-raise-funds-for-childrens-hospital/dance-marathon_alex-gonzalez-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1425172318\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dance Marathon\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-61473\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"Alex Gonzalez/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dance-Marathon_Alex-Gonzalez-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-61473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Dance Marathon raised a total of $35,347.11.  <em>Alex Gonzalez/Daily Nexus</em></p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

IVTU held a meeting earlier this week, seen here, about the situation. <i>Daily Nexus File Photo</i></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) will lead a march from the Pardall Center through I.V. Friday at 1 p.m. to protest the eviction of six households from their apartments at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The march is part of IVTU’s three-day “Tenants Re-Claiming Isla Vista” <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/ivtu-holds-campaign-for-evicted-i-v-residents/\">campaign</a> created to amass support for evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas whose renovated units underwent an alleged 50 percent rent increase. The campaign aims to urge Majestic Asset Management, LLC, the management company working for Abrego Villas’ property owners, to pay the tenants’ relocation benefits, required under Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444.</p>\n<p>IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov said the march has been organized to promote justice for the evicted tenants at the Abrego Villas and to inspire further legislative action to prevent future unjustified evictions in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are requesting that Majestic Asset Management pay the tenants the relocation benefits that they rightly deserve but have not yet received,” Bogdanov said. “We would like to show to the legislatures on the county and statewide levels that Isla Vista is in need of legislative reforms and improvements to strengthen tenant variety as well as to improve the housing situation in I.V.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities. – IVTU president and third-year economics major Andrey Bogdanov</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bogdanov said the march is also intended to educate and unite all tenants renting spaces in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Lack of knowledge on the part of the tenants about their rights in housing issues is a big problem in Isla Vista and … affects all members of the community,” Bogdanov said. “The only way we can create a real difference is by becoming more educated and uniting to demand better housing.”</p>\n<p>California Assemblymember for Santa Barbara Das Williams said he supports the IVTU’s campaign and that without their action there would be little knowledge of the issue in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think that if they weren’t doing something that we might not even know about it,” Williams said. “I hope they will continue to engage the owners in a respectful and civil manner as something that might actually provide some benefits for the families that were involved.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said this is not a one-time issue but rather the latest in a series of evictions of low-income residents, primarily Latino families, in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to rally the community support and raise awareness about the fact that these housing issues are recurring, and ongoing” Bogdanov said. “We are not talking about statistics here, we are talking about lives of real people who are being denied fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities.”</p>\n<p>President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak said the property owner of Abrego Villas is responsible for the evictions that violated Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444, not Majestic Asset Management, LLC.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenants in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts. – President of Majestic Asset Management, LLC Brian Lezak</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Lezak, Majestic Asset Management, LLC plans to present an argument in defense of the company in court.</p>\n<p>“We intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said, “We will defend our position in court which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Williams said he believes Majestic Asset Management, LLC should pay the tenants the relocation benefits he thinks they deserve.</p>\n<p>“In my mind either they should comply because they are required to do so, or because it is the right thing to do. Either way it was the intent of the county ordinance to cover situations like this,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams said evictions such as these can be a result of maximization of rent returns by all I.V. landlords, which can create discrimination problems in I.V. against low-income residents.</p>\n<p>“The diversity of having families a part of Isla Vista is something that can mitigate some of the public safety concerns,” Williams said. “The most interesting, the most safe, and the most thriving neighborhoods are ones that have demographic diversity, and one of the challenges we have in Isla Vista is increasing demographic concentration.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60323\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60323\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-29/planned-march-to-protest-abrego-evictions/","id":4782,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[4781,4780,4779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Memorial Walk Remembers the Fallen","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In honor of lives lost to alcohol and drug use as well as to the six students who passed away in the 2014 Isla Vista mass murder, a crowd of students trekked from Embarcadero Hall to the streets of I....","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58972\" style=\"width: 678px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IV-Memorial-Walk-by-Kenneth-Song-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1587685946\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58967\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58972\" data-attachment-id=\"58972\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/iv-memorial-walk/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IV-Memorial-Walk-by-Kenneth-Song-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C820&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,820\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.5\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"The memorial attendees led by the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta (left) and Outreach Coordinator Marjan Riazi (center) enter Del Playa Drive on Tuesday night.

Tuesday night in a candle-lit memorial titled “Remembering Our Fallen Gauchos and Friends.”</p>\n<p>The third annual memorial walk organized by the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, “Remembering Our Fallen Gauchos and Friends” aimed to bring attention to victims of alcohol and drug abuse-related incidents, as well as to commemorate the victims of last May’s I.V. shooting. Due to rainy weather, memorial attendees walked through I.V. streets in coats, jackets and umbrellas.</p>\n<p>Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Education and Outreach Coordinator Marjan Riazi said the event was created in order to provide an opportunity for students to support each other through common experiences of loss.</p>\n<p>“This event is for students and community members who want to come together within a community of support to grieve and process their loss and experience,” Riazi said, “especially this year, as we additionally remember victims of the Isla Vista Tragedy.”</p>\n<p>The memorial walk also aimed to address the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse in I.V., specifically seeking to warn against “synergy,” or mixing alcohol with other drugs, which Riazi said is a persistent health issue in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Synergy, which has caused a number of deaths in Isla Vista, is prevalent within our community,” Riazi said. “It’s crucial for our students to be aware of the dangers of mixing alcohol and other drugs.”</p>\n<p>Alcohol &amp; Drug Program Director Jackie Kurta said the memorial walk, along with other community-building efforts in I.V. and on campus, has played a significant role in helping to mend the I.V. and campus community in wake of recent unrest and tragedy.</p>\n<p>“We have taken this opportunity to just come together to remember students and community members we have lost,” Kurta said. “This year of course is especially powerful for all of us, we wanted to open this up to the larger community.”</p>\n<p>Gauchos for Recovery peer Nina Taylor said the walk had personal significance to her, as alcohol and drug issues are something that effect an extensive number of students on campus.</p>\n<p>“The reason I’m here is not only to support my community. This also touches base with some of the things I experience weekly with students that come and see us in our recovery program,” said Taylor. “I know a lot of people struggle and have had friends or family who have struggled with alcohol and drugs and as a result have injured themselves or lost their lives.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year anthropology major Brian Lee said the walk helped spur I.V. recovery from the May 23 tragedy and other common grievances experienced by students and I.V. residents last school year.</p>\n<p>“Ever since the shooting last year, it’s been really hard to recover as a community,” Lee said, “I thought tonight was a great way to just come together in peace and reminisce.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58967\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58967\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-03/memorial-walk-remembers-the-fallen/","id":4802,"author":{"id":165,"name":"Addie Burk"},"related":[4801,4800,4799],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/165"}},"__N_SSG":true}
