The young lady attempted to remain optimistic, yelling “we will have fun,” albeit while crying, in an attempt to rally her entourage of, well, no one.</p>\n<p>Despite her cheery outlook on the turn of events, fun was not on the agenda for the rest of the Swede’s night. Realizing her impending incarceration, the suave Swede’s optimism turned to threats against national security … and undergarments. While waiting for her complimentary ride to the county jail, the femme fatale began yelling, “I have a Swedish terrorist in my panties. I have a bomb. I’m a Swedish terrorist and I will kill you.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41885\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41885\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-13/police-blotter-73/","id":3816,"author":{"id":264,"name":"Megan Meyer"},"related":[3815,3814,3813],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"City Defers Bench Proposal","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Santa Barbara City Council voted against a proposal to rotate benches on State Street as a panhandling deterrent during their Tuesday meeting.

Last night was a<br>\nsetback to our progress.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36642\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-10/city-defers-bench-proposal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36642\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-10/city-defers-bench-proposal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-10/city-defers-bench-proposal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-10/city-defers-bench-proposal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-10/city-defers-bench-proposal/","id":3813,"author":{"id":264,"name":"Megan Meyer"},"related":[3812,3811,3810],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/264"}},"__N_SSG":true}
