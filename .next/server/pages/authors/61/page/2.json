President, Brooke Kopel, with authoring a letter to the Chancellor which will include “the dangers presented by an increasingly militarized police force” and “the dangers police have posed to the student body in the past.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having the UC be armed is something that should not be happening, especially the UCPD,” Uribe said during Wednesday night’s Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uribe cited Deltopia and Halloween as instances of “over-policing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It should never get to the point where a trained officer has to use their weapon in any sort of capacity to a student… There are a lot of non-lethal ways that a police officer can make sure that a situation doesn’t escalate,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It shouldn’t have to be the work of untrained civilians to de-escalate the situation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ivana Cruz, the resolution’s student sponsor, stated that Wednesday was the 49th anniversary of the beginning of the Isla Vista Riot in 1970. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s rarely talked about.

An <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/asks-amended.pdf\">updated version of the Asks</a> was then posted to SASA’s website on Feb. 4.</p>\n<p>The first of the Asks requests the Campus, Advocacy, Resources and Education office (C.A.R.E.), Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the UC Police Department and the Women’s Center, among others, to be required to attend an open town hall at the beginning of each quarter “for students to voice their questions and concerns.”</p>\n<p>The updated version of the Asks says that the timing of the town hall must be confirmed with SASA at least three weeks in advance, “along with any administrative reports that will be discussed at the Town Hall.”</p>\n<p>This first Ask has already begun implementation – there was a town hall on Nov. 7, and the next town hall is set for Feb. 25, according to Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) director Emily Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“I think the last town hall went well, I’m happy that we left the town hall with written-down agreements that we all talked about and what each individual in that room is responsible for,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“Those type of conversations with administration then kind of morphed these [updated] Asks.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford added that SASA has spoken to multiple members of UCSB administration in order to begin implementing the rest of the Asks, including Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, UCSB Title IX Officer Ariana Alvarez, C.A.R.E. director Briana Conway and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead, among others.</p>\n<p>The second Ask says that UCSB must provide SASA with “five thousand dollars annually and by the start of the fiscal year— beginning in 2019— in order to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>The original list of Asks did not specify the amount needed to fund the campaign.</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said SASA hasn’t spoken to administration about this Ask yet.</p>\n<p>“I assume Margaret would be the best person to speak to about this,” Montalvo-Telford said. “I believe it’s absolutely necessary that we receive this amount of funds.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford clarified that SASA does not believe that these funds should be coming from student fees, and instead the funds should be coming from “the university itself.”</p>\n<p>The third Ask says that the UCSB Title IX office “must provide an annual Public Accountability Report as modeled by the UCLA Title IX office.”</p>\n<p>The updated list of Asks adds that the UCSB Title IX office “must redesign their website to make the information more accessible to students, faculty, and staff.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said that there seems to be some pushback from administration in regards to updating UCSB’s Public Accountability Report so it models UCLA’s, but she is confident that SASA can “work something out” with the administration.</p>\n<p>UCSB administration has yet to agree to make amendments to its current Public Accountability Report.</p>\n<p>“We definitely need to have more conversations about what this Public Accountability Report would look like for our campus,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>UCLA’s Public Accountability Report provides “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>“The difference between our campus and the UCLA campus, to my knowledge, is that the UCLA Title IX office and the UCLA Discrimination Prevention office work together to produce this report, versus here, there seems to be a greater distinction between [those two entities] when they’re producing these numbers,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“The Public Accountability report provided by the UCLA office is so much more thorough, has more information, and it’s just easier to read, it’s easier to understand, easier to follow,” she added. “While it is about the content, it’s also about how easy that content is to be absorbed.”</p>\n<p>The Title IX office has said that they made edits to the website in order to increase accessibility, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>The fourth Ask was not on the original list of Asks – it says that UCSB “must make C.A.R.E.’s Standard of Excellence Training mandatory for OSL organizations and sports teams/clubs.”</p>\n<p>The fifth Ask is new as well, adding that the C.A.R.E office “must provide online access to their Standard of Excellence Training modules regarding healthy relationships and sexual violence and sexual harassment prevention.”</p>\n<p>In order to address both of these Asks, SASA has created subcommittees that consist of Alvarez, Conway, Associate Dean of Students Kim Equinoa, and Director of the Office of Student Life Miles Ashlock.</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said that the subcommittees are “working together to try to figure out the most realistic and effective way to implement [the Asks].”</p>\n<p>Currently, the fraternities and sororities are the only organizations required to undergo the Standard of Excellence Training. However, Montalvo-Telford wants that to expand that. She said she believes that the fourth Ask is feasible.</p>\n<p>“We’re not suggesting that the same methods be used to implement the Standard of Excellence Training that is provided by C.A.R.E., what we’re suggesting is that there is a way to make this training mandatory for different groups on campus.”</p>\n<p>The first subcommittee meeting is this week, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>The final updated Ask states that UCSB must “provide online access to the Gaucho FYI content.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, SASA “must be provided an opportunity to contribute to and review Gaucho FYI material upon any decisions to alter any content.”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford said that this final updated Ask is “in its route to being met.”</p>\n<p>SASA has spoken to Equinoa about creating an “online, accessible format of Gaucho FYI” and that Equinoa confirmed that it was possible, according to Montalvo-Telford. Montalvo-Telford believes it can be implemented in time for next year’s Gaucho FYI content.</p>\n<p>SASA also plans to work with administration to provide next year’s Gaucho FYI presentation.</p>\n<p>“To my understanding, what Kim has agreed to right now is allowing us to review the content, give any suggestions we might have,” Montalvo-Telford said. “It has not been said specifically that we have voting power [on the content] but that could be the product of a further conversation.”</p>\n<p>Overall, Montalvo-Telford is satisfied with the progress that has been made regarding the Asks, and she believes that the administration has been very upfront and realistic with SASA.</p>\n<p>“It’s always going to be hard when you’re working with so many different offices trying to figure out the correct solution, but we have been able come together in a room, spit out ideas, and work with each other.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 20, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>. </em></p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma is the university news editor of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or simren@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

students declared candidacy in the special election: Ng and fourth-year political science and English double major Richard Zierer. However, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-23/zierer-drops-out-of-evpsa-election-ng-now-running-unopposed/\">Zierer dropped out of the race</a> on Wednesday morning, leaving Ng unopposed.</p>\n<p>The last student to hold the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/term-in-review-evpsa-kristin-hsu/\">Kristin Hsu</a>, who focused much of her term on decreasing tuition during a time when the University of California Regents were threatening a tuition increase due to lack of state funding.</p>\n<p>If elected, Ng, a fourth-year global studies and biological sciences double major, plans to go in a different direction than Hsu.</p>\n<p>Ng hopes to center her agenda around statewide affairs as it concerns sexual assault policy, common sense gun control and reproductive justice.</p>\n<p>“I’m more interested in increasing the amount of resources we have on campus,” Ng said.</p>\n<p>One of her goals is to ensure that the newly created Survivor Resource Center in Isla Vista receives funding “in order to have the branch… be all that it can be.”</p>\n<p>“I really would be pushing for increased access to sexual assault resources,” Ng added.</p>\n<p>She also plans to advocate for stricter gun control policies, and was one of the organizers for Santa Barbara’s March for Our Lives.</p>\n<p>“I’m from Thousand Oaks,” Ng said. “It both personally touches me, and it’s also one of those things that shouldn’t be contentious.”</p>\n<p>Ng previously lobbied for <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/state-senator-reintroduces-bill-to-ensure-medication-abortion-access-at-public-universities/\">Senate Bill 24</a>, formerly Senate Bill 320, which would require all public university campuses, including UC Santa Barbara, to provide access to medication abortion services to students.</p>\n<p>“We luckily now have a governor who’s willing to pass it, so I’ve been really advocating for that,” Ng said.</p>\n<p>In terms of the EVPSA’s job to represent the student body on larger platforms, Ng believes that UCSB deserves a stronger voice in both the United States Student Association (USSA) and the University of California Student Association (UCSA).</p>\n<p>“We fund the vast majority of both of those entities,” Ng said. “If we’re the ones funding a lot of it, that means UC Santa Barbara should be up there with a really loud voice.”</p>\n<p>If elected, Ng plans to attend every A.S. Senate meeting to inform senators of relevant legislation.</p>\n<p>Ng started out her first year at UCSB involved in the Residential Housing Association as a Project Care Director.</p>\n<p>In her second year, Ng was an officer of Los Curanderos, which is a pre-med club on campus that is meant to focus on “disadvantaged communities who don’t have access to equal healthcare.”</p>\n<p>At the beginning of her third year, she joined the Associated Students (A.S.) Human Rights Board (HRB), becoming the chair a quarter after she joined.</p>\n<p>Ng said that through her position in the HRB, she’s collaborated with the EVPSA office on multiple projects.</p>\n<p>“Last year I worked with them on the huge memorial we had in front of Storke with all the backpacks,” Ng said. “For this quarter, during Human Rights Week, [the EVPSA office] is coming out to do their own event.”</p>\n<p>Ng plans to utilize social media and class announcements in order to campaign, and believes that the lack of voter turnout in the previous EVPSA elections was due to voter burnout, as students were more focused on the national midterm elections.</p>\n<p>The 16 percent voter threshold was not met in the Fall Quarter special election and the sole candidate running was not voted in.</p>\n<p>Winter special election voting opens Thursday at 8 a.m. on G.O.L.D.</p>\n<p>At least eight percent of the student body must vote for the election to be valid. If the election meets the eight percent threshold, Ng will only serve for approximately three months until the winner of the Spring Quarter 2019 election is sworn in.</p>\n<p><i>A version of the article appeared on p.3 of the Jan. 24, 2019 print edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Simren Verma is the university news editor at the </i>Daily Nexus <i>and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or simren@dailynexus.com.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

To some extent, their calls seem to have been heard.</p>\n<p>Hannah-Beth Jackson, Santa Barbara’s state senator representing California’s 19th district and author of SB 1346, optimistically expressed approval for the new gun control laws.</p>\n<p>Although these laws encompass the entire state, UCSB’s past experience with gun violence oftentimes compels many local leaders and students to be more vocal about their opinions on the issue of gun control.</p>\n<p>In May 2014, a violent attack in I.V. left six people dead. Half died due to gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p>“[UCSB] students will support these laws by being reminded that we need to do more — this will give them an incentive to call for more action, particularly at the federal level to combat gun violence,” Jackson said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>Combating gun violence has been an ongoing initiative in California, highlighted by legislative action taken by former California Governor Jerry Brown.</p>\n<p>While Gov. Brown did sign some bills addressing gun control, he also vetoed a number of them, some of which could have reduced the number of guns in the state, Jackson said.</p>\n<p>In the context of gun control, Jackson has high expectations for Gov. Newsom.</p>\n<p>“I expect him to be very supportive of policies that help reduce gun violence and keep our communities safe,” she said.</p>\n<p>Jackson believes her bump-stock bill, SB 1346, will have an impact in reducing gun violence by prohibiting access to bump stocks in California and will hopefully reduce the number of gun deaths in the state.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy to see that our representative Hannah Beth Jackson introduced SB 1346,” Jeike Meijer, Associated Students (A.S.) executive vice president of local affairs, said in an email.</p>\n<p>Meijer spoke at the vigil for the 11 lives lost in a Pittsburgh synagogue due to gun violence and then again at the vigil in remembrance of the Thousand Oaks shooting victims.</p>\n<p>Both mass shootings occurred in November.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’ll see the rest of the country follow California soon,” Meijer added.</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel, A.S. president, believes the new legislation will be effective.</p>\n<p>“[Gun violence] is always on people’s minds, on prospective students’ minds, and I think that these kinds of measures are exactly what we need to have students feel more comfortable and safe in Isla Vista,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>Kopel believes that SB 1100 specifically, which raises the minimum age to 21 to purchase a firearm, would make UCSB students more comfortable “knowing that the people around them can’t even purchase a firearm.”</p>\n<p>“Even though most of the students that are attending this university now weren’t here to experience the 2014 shooting, that legacy does live on through vigils and remembrances,” Kopel added.</p>\n<p>Still, Kopel finds that more work needs to be done and believes that a “cultural change” regarding guns is needed in the United States.</p>\n<div

done.</p>\n<p>Limón is specifically looking forward to the potential impacts of AB 3129, which imposes a lifetime ban on individuals convicted of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>“I am especially hopeful that AB 3129… will make an impact in reducing the rate of women and children who die at the hands of repeat domestic abusers,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District, believes that California serves as a model for the rest of the country when it comes to gun control legislation.</p>\n<p>“As a resident of Isla Vista, I feel like my voice has been heard and that our calls for reducing the amount of gun violence in this country are actually being taken seriously,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>While Brandt believes that California is an effective leader on gun control legislation, he does not think the federal government has been adequately following California’s lead.</p>\n<p>“The national government, under the Republican Party, has decided that they’re going to pretend like they can ignore this issue and it’ll just go away,” Brandt said. “I think that that philosophy is something that has never worked out well and never been viewed well by history.”</p>\n<p>“The federal government used to look to California as a model, because these are the sorts of bills that should be implemented nationally.”</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal said that he’s fighting for just that: he wants pieces of California gun control legislation to be laws of the nation.</p>\n<p>Carbajal plans to reintroduce the Gun Violence Restraining Act in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>“[The Gun Violence Restraining Act] allows family members, when they come across a loved one that seems to be, through their behavior, posing a danger to themselves or others… to work with law enforcement, officials and the court system to temporarily take guns away from [that individual],” Carbajal said in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually similar to the one that California has in place that was enacted after the tragedy that happened in Isla Vista and UCSB, so it’s duplicating a similar law that exists in California.”</p>\n<p>Carbajal believes that the new California gun control legislation will enhance gun safety in California, and says he is “working to introduce similar legislation and be part of similar legislation introduced here in the House of Representatives.”</p>\n<p>“Far too many lives continue to be taken due to unnecessary gun use,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>“We need to make sure we are passing banning assault weapons, that we are banning high capacity magazines and that we move forward with universal background checks and the Gun Violence Restraining Order

The Public and Mental Health Commission was approved for $26,000 for this year, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>“Around $10,000 is specifically for the Mental Health Conference,” he said. The rest of the money would be allocated toward honoraria, marketing and projects.</p>\n<p>In the past, the Mental Health Planning Committee, an independent entity, has planned the annual Mental Health Conference. This year, the Public and Mental Health Commission plans on helping the committee.</p>\n<p>The executive board of the Public and Mental Health Commission will have a conference coordinator position dedicated to Mental Health Conference planning, according to Kaayal.</p>\n<p>The executive board will also include co-chairs, policy analysts, a mental health special projects coordinator, a public health special projects coordinator, a nontraditional first generation representative, an event/program director, a QTPOC representative, a financial coordinator and a marketing outreach director among others.</p>\n<p>Kaayal plans to be one of the co-chairs alongside Bongi Makatini, a fourth-year biological sciences major and Spanish minor.</p>\n<p>Makatini reached out to Kaayal after seeing the work he was doing regarding mental and public health. After the resolution passed in March 2018, Kaayal and Makatini came together during Spring Quarter 2018 and worked on the commission over the summer.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t want to step on the toes of the great work that’s already been done on campus, but we really wanted to see A.S. taking more of a stand to try to help tackle different issues regarding mental health here on campus,” Makatini said.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Committees already approved Kaayal and Makatini for the co-chair positions and submitted the two appointments to A.S. President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>Kopel has sent those appointments to A.S. Senate, and A.S. Senate now must vote in favor of the appointments. The Senate must also approve all other executive board appointments.</p>\n<p>Even though the executive board has yet to be approved, Kaayal and Makatini have started planning prospective projects.</p>\n<p>One of the projects involves free flu shots for UCSB students, according to Kaayal. The project would be funded by the commission.</p>\n<p>“We’re also working with student health and library administration and custodial services to start placing hand sanitizer dispensers around campus,” Kaayal said.</p>\n<p>“We’re starting to target the library first and then hopefully branch that out to the UCen and lecture halls.”</p>\n<p>Makatini mentioned the toll the quarter system takes on the mental health of UCSB students, and how students who never had mental health problems prior to college “all of a sudden have anxiety or depression or any other mental health disorders.”</p>\n<p>“We really want to make sure that students have a central voice through Associated Students to be able to utilize these different resources,” Makatini said.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Elections Board held another meeting on Nov. 13, in which Elections Board member Andrew Yan motioned to set the voter threshold for the winter special election to 10 percent, according to Elections Board minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Quan stated that since the threshold for a General Election is 20%, a special election voter threshold for one position should be half of that,” the Elections Board minutes read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s A.S. Senate meeting, Elections Board Chair John Paul Renteria presented the petition to hold a special election during Winter Quarter 2019 for the EVPSA position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Elections Board’s minutes, Election’s Board would have begun advertising for the special election after the petition was approved by A.S.

Senate meeting, Renteria said he believed the threshold of 10 percent is obtainable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In June, A.S.

But what will the office look like to the larger state of California, I don’t know,” Gessesse said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an injustice to students’ needs and concerns beyond the absence of an executive member.”</span></p>\n<p>The full UCSA letter can be read <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ucsb-letter.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

The first of the Asks would expand this amount to three.</p>\n<p>“We do think that there’s a disconnect between students and the people who are in the power to make decisions about students,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The second of the Asks requests that UCSB must provide SASA with “the funds to organize a campus-wide campaign regarding affirmative consent.”</p>\n<p>The reach of the campaign depends on the amount of funding the university provides, Montalvo-Telford added.</p>\n<p>The third Ask says that the UCSB Title IX office “must provide an annual Public Accountability Report as modeled by the UCLA Title IX office.”</p>\n<p>UC Los Angeles’s (UCLA) <a href=\"https://equity.ucla.edu/public_accountability/public_accountability_reports/\">Public Accountability Report</a> provides “anonymized descriptive statistics about complaints, investigations, and sanctions that have been meted out in the past,” according to UCLA’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion website page.</p>\n<p>“I think that there’s mystery surrounding the Title IX office; we don’t really know what’s going on in there … I think that being at least transparent about the stats of what’s going on in there is comforting, as a student,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final of the Asks says UCSB “must create a paid position for a SASA member to organize an hour long conversation about consent and sexual violence.”</p>\n<p>This position would replace the current Gaucho FYI content on consent and sexual violence, and it would “act as its own subsection of Gaucho FYI.”</p>\n<p>“The way that consent is being taught at Gaucho FYI … limits the way that consent is able to be talked about,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>“We don’t think that consent really stops at ‘yes means yes.’ It’s more than that,” Montolvo-Telford added. “It’s talking about, ‘What does consent actually looks like inside of the bedroom? How do we use it in practice and not just in definition?’”</p>\n<p>Montalvo-Telford believes that the benefit of having a SASA member give the presentation is that a SASA member would have more freedom than a Gaucho FYI presenter.</p>\n<p>“We are able to include things that were necessarily restricted before,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>In theory, a member of SASA would not have these restrictions, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>SASA does not have a set number in mind for the wage of the position.</p>\n<p>The list of Asks has been endorsed by A.S. President Brooke Kopel, External Vice President of Local Affairs Jeike Meijer, Lobby Corps, I Am That Girl, Hermanos, the Armenian Student Association, Making Adventures Possible for All Students (M.A.P.A.S) and Stop the Traffik L.A.</p>\n<p>“As the first woman president that UCSB has had in the past four years, sexual assault issues are at the top of my priorities,” Kopel said in an email. “I unequivocally agreed that each and every one of those asks should and must be implemented by our university administration.”</p>\n<p>SASA is currently working on a resolution with on-campus senator Zion Solomon and off-campus senator Christian Ornelas that endorses the list of Asks, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to have it in front of Senate by next week,” Montalvo-Telford said. “We are prepared to make our argument in support.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the Asks, SASA released the <a href=\"https://www.sasa-ca.org/index.php/projects/#survey\">results of a survey</a> that was conducted during Spring Quarter 2018. The responses were collected anonymously during a two-week time frame and all participants were associated with UCSB.</p>\n<p>The survey results included data regarding sexual assault, survivors’ reasoning for not reporting, respondents’ knowledge of resources and policies and attitudes toward the university.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised to see that the reason why folks chose not to report was because that they felt that the offense was not serious enough,” Montalvo-Telford said.</p>\n<p>The data from the survey helped SASA determine how the Asks should be structured, according to Montalvo-Telford.</p>\n<p>“We definitely believe that all of these Asks are necessary to our campus. What they look like requires a conversation between us and the administration. All of them, in their thesis, are necessary for this campus.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Department of Public Worms will be the primary manager of the farm once it is constructed. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“This project has been something that we’ve been really actively working on for about four years, although it was in our minds even before that,” Maynard said. “In order to get to this stage, we’ve had to work with so many different people.”</p>\n<p>Funding for the farm came from the UC Global Food Initiative, A.S. Coastal Fund, the Green Initiative Fund, the Food Security Taskforce, the Healthy Campus Network and the Fund for Santa Barbara Youth Making Change Board, among others.</p>\n<p>“A recent survey showed that 48% of undergraduate students surveyed and 31% of graduate students surveyed reported experiencing food insecurity in the past year,” Margaret Klawunn, the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, said in a speech at the farm’s groundbreaking event on West Campus.</p>\n<p>“Today we’re starting an effort that will help to reclaim food waste and create food for students who need it the most.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said the new farm will produce far more food than any of the Edible Campus Program’s current projects. However, she was not able to give an estimate on how much food that would be.</p>\n<p>“It is hard to put an exact number on how much we will produce as we are proposing an innovative approach, mother nature is not always predictable, and we haven’t started farming yet,” Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>The construction of the farm will go through December and the beds for the farm will be built in the winter. The Edible Campus Program will be able to start planting in the spring, Maynard said.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Department of Public Worms will be the primary manager of the farm once it is constructed.</p>\n<p>“We registered 2,697 students in the last academic year for Calfresh and now we’re creating the space for students to grow their own food through campus gardens and farms,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>The food will be picked on the farm and delivered to the pantries on the same day, according to Alex Moon, Edible Campus Program student coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Our farm is built on a garden movement that stretches back over 40 years at UCSB and even longer in Isla Vista,” Moon said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “We are so lucky to be a part of a university which celebrates student leadership and engages students in the shared governance of our community.”</p>\n<p>“As students, we are given the rare opportunity to dream up new ideas and test them right here on campus.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the new farm, the Edible Campus Program is also working on vertical hydroponic gardens at the UCSB Recreation Center, an urban orchard at Storke Plaza and an urban agriculture educational series.</p>\n<p>“It takes many hands to make the vision for the student farm a reality,” Chancellor Yang said in a speech at the groundbreaking event. “This farm will be a vital part of our campus food initiative and also our proud sustainability practices.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

analyst for the current EVPSA office. Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The special election comes following the disqualification of Mayela Morales, a fifth-year global studies and Chicanx studies double major, in May.</p>\n<p>Morales won the position of External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) in April. However, she was later found to not be enrolled in any classes at UCSB during the Spring Quarter, according to Gaucho On-Line Database (G.O.L.D.) public records.</p>\n<p>A.S. Legal Code mandates that executive candidates be enrolled in at least six units per quarter to be eligible for office.</p>\n<p>Because Morales was disqualified approximately three weeks after the elections were held, UC Santa Barbara’s A.S. Elections Board mandated a special election to be held for the EVPSA position during Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Although Loudon, a third-year history of public policy major, is the only officially declared candidate, potential write-in candidates may join the race.</p>\n<p>Write-in candidates must declare candidacy by emailing the A.S. Elections Board by Oct. 7, John Paul Renteria, the chair of A.S. Elections Board, said at a Senate meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>For the special election, there is still a minimum voting threshold of 16 percent, meaning 16 percent of UC Santa Barbara students need to vote in order for the results to be valid, according to Renteria.</p>\n<p>If this voter threshold is not met, the A.S. Elections Board will extend one week to the voting period.</p>\n<p>If the threshold still is not met after the week extension, the EVPSA office will be vacant until the A.S. Spring 2019 elections.</p>\n<p>A.S Senate passed a resolution in July which split the position’s funds and duties among several individuals.</p>\n<p>Temporary access to EVPSA funds were granted to the External Vice President for Local Affairs, the Student Advocate General, the A.S. President, the A.S. President Proxy, and the Lobby Corps Co-Chairs.</p>\n<p>Their duties will be dissolved “the date that the new EVPSA is sworn-in,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Loudon was the co-chair of Lobby Corps and served as a policy analyst for the current EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>During the EVPSA candidate forum in April, Loudon detailed her plans if elected into the position, which included securing “state investment” which does not just apply to fighting tuition hikes, but also to getting the State of California to invest in all issues affecting students.</p>\n<p>Loudon added that voter registration would also be a priority of hers. Loudon also said she wanted to increase education surrounding how students can utilize existing mental health resources.</p>\n<p>The candidate forums for the Special Election will take place on Oct. 5, and active campaigning will take place on Oct. 7.</p>\n<p>The voting period will begin on Oct. 15 and will end on Oct. 18, when the results will be released.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Mifeprex. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>“Access to reproductive health services, including abortion, is a long-protected right in California,” Governor Brown said in his <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SB-320-veto.pdf\">veto message</a>.</p>\n<p>However, he added that because the average distance to abortion providers in campus communities is five to seven miles, as stated in a study sponsored by the SB320 supporters, the bill is “not necessary.”</p>\n<p>California Senator Connie Leyva originally introduced <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB320\">SB 320</a> in Feb. 2017. The bill passed its final vote in the California State Senate on Aug. 30, 2018.</p>\n<p>The bill would have required all University of California and California State University campuses to offer the pills by Jan. 1, 2022, including UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It is the intent of the Legislature that public university student health centers make abortion by medication techniques as accessible and cost-effective for students as possible, and thus public university student health centers should treat abortion by medication techniques as a basic health service,” according to the bill’s text.</p>\n<p>The<em> Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/abortion-pill-clears-hurdle-on-path-to-public-universities/#search\">previously reported</a> that The National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a non-partisan council, released a report on March 16 that confirmed that the Mifeprex pill is safe and effective.</p>\n<p>Support for this bill came largely from the Women’s Foundation and the Tara Health Foundation. The two foundations <a href=\"http://justcarecalifornia.org/press/national-academies-of-sciences-report-on-abortion-context-experts-on-sb-320/\">helped fund</a> the implementation of SB 320 into public universities.</p>\n<p>“We are disappointed that Gov. Brown failed to support what the Senate, the Assembly, and 6 in 10 Californians already have recognized in this groundbreaking bill — that students of California need abortion care on campus,” Surina Khan, the CEO of The Women’s Foundation of California, said in a <a href=\"https://womensfoundca.org/news/governor-brown-vetoes-campus-abortion-bill/\">press release</a>.</p>\n<p>“We choose to listen to students, not those in power who continually deny their reproductive rights. We deserve a system that works for the student[s] of California.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

renewable energy sources. <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>On Sept. 4, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) announced in a press release that this “expansion of its system-wide sustainability goals” was a part of the UC’s Carbon Neutrality Initiative.</p>\n<p>The Carbon Neutrality Initiative began in 2013, when UC President Janet Napolitano proposed the goal of making the UCs a zero net energy consumer by 2025.</p>\n<p>Along with the 2013 commitment to become carbon neutral, UC now also aims for “100 percent reliance on clean electricity suppliers across its campuses and medical centers by 2025,” according to the press release.</p>\n<p>UC has already saved $220 million by utilizing its energy efficiency programs.</p>\n<p>At UC Santa Barbara, students have been working on the 100 Percent Campaign for the past two years, according to Adriana Munoz, the vice chair of UCSB’s California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) branch.</p>\n<p>“CALPIRG Students have been working very hard to create buzz about renewable energy by talking to thousands of students about this issue and signing them up as members to our organization,” Munoz said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We’ve also worked with other student organizations as well as with faculty to show overall campus support for this issue.”</p>\n<p>She added that the campaign has been a priority due to the effects of climate change on California, which include fires that have occurred close to UCSB’s campus, such as the Thomas Fire, the second largest fire in the state’s history.</p>\n<p>“We are so proud that our UC system is working with students in order to take more steps towards a clean energy future and CALPIRG Students looks forward to working with them on this issue further,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>UC is also committed to not using on-site fossil fuel combustion for new buildings and renovations after June 2019, as well as reducing its overall energy-use intensity, the press release said.</p>\n<p>The UC commitment precedes Governor Jerry Brown’s signing of Senate Bill 100 on Sept. 10.</p>\n<p>SB 100, authored by State Senator Kevin de León, requires the state of California to use 100-percent renewable and zero-carbon electricity sources by 2045.</p>\n<p>“With Governor Brown’s order, California establishes the most ambitious carbon neutrality commitment of any major economic jurisdiction in the world,” a press release from Gov. Brown said.</p>\n<p>“It will not be easy. It will not be immediate. But it must be done.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Sept. 20 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
