The UCSB Campus Democrats endorsed Murillo and supported her campaign by contacting constituents through door-to-door canvassing and phone banking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results counted early Wednesday morning did not included mail-in ballots. The official election results, which will include mail-in ballots, are expected to be counted by Wednesday, Nov. 15. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily Murray, a second-year history of public policy major and president of the UCSB Campus Democrats, said the organization created an internship program for students to participate in canvassing and phone banking for at least six hours a week. Each week, they could also attend an hour-long seminar to learn more about political campaigns.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, a third-year history of public policy major and Isla Vista Community Services District board member, canvassed and phone banked for Murillo’s campaign. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said Murillo is an advocate for many issues including environmental protections, policies against the gang injunction and affordable housing in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandt said affordable housing is a critical issue for UCSB students after graduation.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB students are graduating and finding that they can no longer live in the community,” he said. “This is becoming a generational issue, and it’s our generation that is getting left high and dry.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Santa Barbara Democratic Party officially </span><a href=\"http://www.sbdems.org/endorsements\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">endorsed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Cathy Murillo for mayor, the two remaining Democratic candidates, city council members Hal Conklin and Bendy White, did not drop out of the race.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the split ticket among the Democratic candidates, Murillo still received 6,881 votes, while Republican runner-up city councilmember Frank Hotchkiss received 5,025 votes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cathy Murillo was first elected to the city council in 2011, the </span><a href=\"https://cathymurillo.com/about/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first Latina ever elected</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and she is now set to become Santa Barbara’s first ever Latina mayor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cathy Murillo is a UCSB alumni and former journalist for the Santa Barbara Independent, Los Angeles Times and Ventura County Star.
