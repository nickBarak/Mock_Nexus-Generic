A portion of the one-time funds could also potentially go toward 2018-19 enrollment growth.</p>\n<p>About $2 million of the one-time funds will be allocated toward efforts to increase diversity amongst faculty, along with $4 million toward legal services for the undocumented community on UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Additionally, $1.5 million will go toward addressing student hunger.</p>\n<p>About $35 million of the one-time funds will be used for deferred maintenance and $15.5 million for research, according to the senate bill.</p>\n<p>Napolitano has yet to release a statement on the signed Budget Act, and it is unknown at this time whether the funding was enough to prevent a future in-state tuition increase for UC students.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

included issues regarding student rights, landlord issues, creating a community court and instituting a new parking system.</p>\n<p>While some of these plans fell through, Labowe-Stoll was able to implement other projects and focus her time on being a liason for UC Santa Barbara in Isla Vista and within the Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she had to put many projects on hold due to “day-to-day” issues in I.V. that frequently arose and required a majority of her attention.</p>\n<p>“I had planned out a very different year than what had happened, and it’s because I represent students to a living, breathing local community and it’s hard to plan when it comes to that, especially in a community so vibrant and alive as Isla Vista,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she was most proud of the Pause campaign and the Pause. town hall that occured at the beginning of winter quarter.</p>\n<p>The campaign focused on encouraging students to abstain from drug abuse during stressful times and to instead “pause” and try to understand their own mental health as well as their peers, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>She is hoping to implement the ideas brought up at the town hall and has already begun that process by working with UCSB Student Affairs and the Vice Chancellor’s office.</p>\n<p>“I spent a lot of time working on student well-being and mental health just because of the fires and mudslides,” Labowe-Stoll said. “That took up a lot of my year, in terms of trying to inform the faculty and staff at UCSB about why it was so difficult for us to go through winter quarter and deal with all of this on top of just the stresses of being a normal student.”</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll also created Adulting 101, a series of classes offered through the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office which are meant to supplement the academic curriculum students are enrolled in.</p>\n<p>The classes are meant to teach students important life skills about what it means to be an adult in the “real world.”</p>\n<p>The first class was held in February and focused on ways to reduce energy bills in order to save money and help with financial situations.</p>\n<p>The next class will take place in June and will inform dog owners about vaccinations, training and dog-care basics, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll hopes that the Adulting 101 program will continue into next year.</p>\n<p>She explained that all of her projects have been funded through funds allocated to her office. A large portion of those funds went toward a project that plans to distribute guides to the community that contain information about various resources in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“We are distributing guides that have all the resources in Isla Vista, everything from the Pardall office hours to dispatch numbers for the Isla Vista foot patrol, to all 5,000 doors in Isla Vista,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>The guides have been made and are in the process of being paid for, according to Labowe-Stoll. She said the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) and the Finance and Business Committee are also funding the project.</p>\n<p>The guides will be distributed at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said the project was meant to be executed during Fall Quarter 2017, but was postponed due to the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a>. The project was again postponed during the Montecito mudslides in Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>The project was postponed an additional time at the beginning of this quarter as a result of the  the A.S. election season and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\">Measure R</a> efforts, according to Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll said she represented students by attending meetings held by organizations such as Isla Vista Safe, which are chaired by the district attorney of Santa Barbara County and occur once per quarter.</p>\n<p>According to Labowe-Stoll, she also consistently attended Isla Vista Community Network meetings that occur once per month, along with Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) meetings that occur once every two weeks.</p>\n<p>“I pride myself in being the voice of the students. I think EVPLAs have chosen to take on different aspects of their position, but that’s one that I really take pride in,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p><em>Nexus </em>reporters, who attend almost every CSD meeting, reported seeing Labowe-Stoll on an occasional basis.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus, </em>Labowe-Stoll also reflected on Deltopia, which she believes was a success.</p>\n<p>“I think that UCIV and the volunteer base that they’ve cultivated has really helped the process, and I think that being able to help UCIV and the Public Safety Commission with resources and my time has really been valuable to me and to them, too,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>“I take a lot of pride in the fact that we’ve been able to really make Deltopia into a much more positive and safe environment,” she added. “From my perspective, I think it was definitely a win.”</p>\n<p>While citation and arrest numbers dropped this year at Deltopia, the number of medical transports <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/deltopia-attendance-medical-emergencies-rise/\">increased. </a></p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll also said she has been involved with the Measure R campaign and strongly encourages everyone in her office to volunteer their time through canvassing.</p>\n<p>“A.S. takes a very different role in this in the sense that we can’t outright advocate for or against it because of the constraints that we have, but I try to educate people as much as I can,” Labowe-Stoll said. “Obviously I want Measure R to pass very much, I think that it is kind of the final step in the CSD to be able to have this funding to distribute back to the community.”</p>\n<p>She also provided details as to why certain aspects of her platform were not completed.</p>\n<p>Her platform included creating a “Rate My Landlord” website, which would have allowed students to rank and comment on landlords in Isla Vista. She later discovered that there were legal issues regarding students commenting freely on their landlords, as it could lead to lawsuits based on slander.</p>\n<p>She also wanted to create a community court, which would have been an I.V. based program that allowed students charged with minor misdemeanors to deal with officials in I.V. instead of being sent to downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll was unable to complete the project and said she “realized how big it was” and how much legal attention it required as she began to speak to Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>“This was something that I was going to work with Joan Hartmann on. We connected on it a lot at the beginning of the year and I think she got busy and it also kind of fell through,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Another one of Labowe-Stoll’s goals was to institute a parking system where specific parking spots in I.V. could be identified along sidewalks, which would ensure more parking places, but said the project would be postponed until Measure R comes to a vote.</p>\n<p>“[Parking] is a CSD power, and it involves a lot of time and money in terms of running surveys and that kind of stuff,” Labowe-Stoll said. “When I started working on it in the beginning, they [the CSD] said ‘We want to work on it too, obviously it’s our power, but we don’t have any money, so let’s wait for the tax to pass,’ so it pretty much depends on the [Measure R] tax.”</p>\n<p>Labowe-Stoll’s platform also included having Hartmann hold regular office hours in Isla Vista, which was successful. Hartmann holds office hours once a month after the Isla Vista Community Network meetings.</p>\n<p>“I honestly, truly attempted everything I put on my platform,” Labowe-Stoll said.</p>\n<p>Jeike Meijer was elected to be EVPLA for the 2018-19 school year.</p>\n<p><em>Updated 4:01 p.m.: This article was updated to include information about the EVPLA-elect, Jeike Meijer. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version on this article appeared on pg.4 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

the University of California, announced her resignation from the position in an interview with the <i>Nexus</i> last week.</p>\n<p>Salvaty began as a Title IX coordinator at UC Los Angeles and continued to live in Southern California after she received the position as the first system-wide coordinator.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <i>Nexus</i> on April 27, Salvaty said the distance from Southern California to the UC Office of the President (UCOP) in Oakland was part of her decision to resign.</p>\n<p>“It’s a system-wide job, and it’s certainly doable to do from the southern half of the state, but I also spent a lot of time in Oakland and at the Office of the President and that’s where my office was,” Salvaty said. “Ultimately, I think it was starting to take a toll on my family.”</p>\n<p>Salvaty discussed her time serving in the position and said that the most gratifying part was seeing the diversity of the UC campuses while recognizing that they were all similar in their commitments to trying to protect students and faculty.</p>\n<p>She also said a rewarding part of her time serving in the position was the formation of the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">Title IX Student Advisory Board</a>. The board is composed of one undergraduate student and one graduate student from each UC.</p>\n<p>The board has been focused on clarifying Title IX procedures as board members believe the procedures can be hard for students to understand, according to Salvaty.</p>\n<p>“We’re in the process of changing our student procedures, not fundamentally, but adding a lot of clarity,” Salvaty said. “We’re trying to be more clear about how it works.”</p>\n<p>She said the board is considering potential amendments to the system-wide policy.</p>\n<p>The policy amendments stem from a four-year federal investigation that revealed UC Berkeley violated Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, UC Berkeley released a <a href=\"http://complianceresponse.berkeley.edu/pdf/Signed%20Resolution%20Agreement.pdf\">Resolution Agreement</a> outlining new requirements agreed upon with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), a sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Education.</p>\n<p>The changes to the policies are expected to be finalized by the end of February 2019.</p>\n<p>Salvaty’s replacement, Suzanne Taylor, previously worked as an OCR Civil Rights Attorney. Taylor currently works within UCOP as a Title IX principle investigator.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained that she believed the most meaningful work she did within OCR was in the area of sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“My goal in serving as interim is just to continue the great work that she’s done of building the office and continuing with prevention and response efforts and really identifying and helping with implementation of those practices by the campus,” she added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

This isn’t because student fees are too low, it’s because California refuses to invest in public education.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement was released a couple of hours before voting officially opened on G.O.L.D. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Kopel said she wanted to be as transparent as possible with students and she believes that students pay the most attention right before voting starts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s why I wanted to release it at that point, not to get any last minute votes or as a way to put myself up in the elections, but rather to reach as many students as possible when they’re paying attention,” Kopel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CU executive candidates Sophia Dycaico, the candidate for Executive Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA), Madeline Loudon, the candidate for Executive Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and Anthony Pimentel, the candidate for Internal Vice President (IVP), all confirmed they agree with Kopel’s statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dycaico said she had always denounced the raising of student fees to renovate the UCen. Both Dycaico and Kopel told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Monday they believed an official statement was necessary to dispel rumours that Campus United supported the “NewCen” measure as a party.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many candidates support the renovation of the UCen; however, they disagree with raising student fees to complete the renovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that funding should be coming from the state and the UC system and should definitely not be placed as a burden on students,” Loudon said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeike Meijer, the candidate for EVPLA with the Isla Vista Party, said that making students pay for the UCen sets a precedent for students paying for all on-campus renovations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All four candidates running for executive positions with the Isla Vista Party also confirmed they do not support the raising of student fees to renovate the UCen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of them denounced the project before election season began, including Justice Dumlao, the IVP candidate for A.S. president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I’m very glad that she finally is coming out in being against the NewCen project, I think it was just a little late,” Dumlao said. “I’m a little sad that it was late, but better late than never.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said he thought Kopel could have been more open about the fact that she was questioning her position on the NewCen project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao added that he believes Kopel might have felt she could not express her opinions on the ballot measure, as Hieu Le, the current A.S. President and main proponent of the “NewCen” project, ran with Campus United and is affiliated with the same party as Kopel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t want to pin it all on Brooke… I imagine it’s very difficult to denounce something that your current elected president is doing,” Dumlao said. “‘Better late than never’ is how I feel. There’s so many other circumstances that Brooke could have been under or pressured under.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked why she took a stance on the ballot so late in the election season, Kopel said she wanted to gather as much information as possible before making a decision and said she felt as though new facts were coming out about the UCen proposal everyday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I actually wanted to wait as long as I could to hear the most opinions I could,” Kopel added. “That is my job, to understand everybody’s ultimate sentiments toward this project.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mayela Morales, the candidate for External Vice President for Statewide Affairs with the Isla Vista Party, also commented on the timing of Kopel’s statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was a little disheartened to see Brooke coming out with the statement not because I don’t believe that she’s against it, but because students have been so vocal about it for a really long time,” Morales said. “I thought it was very strategic to post that right before voting started.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is always ‘better late than never,’ but I honestly think it was a little too late for her to say that,” Morales added. “I think it was a little too strategic; she could have said that a long time ago.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

id=\"caption-attachment-76374\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Board of Regents approved a 3.5 percent tuition increase for out-of-state undergraduate students Thursday afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents voted 12-3 in favor of the tuition hike, which will add approximately $978 to yearly tuition costs for out-of-state students. The increase will go into effect at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year and is expected to raise $35 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano released a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-board-regents-chair-george-kieffer-and-uc-president-janet-napolitano-gov\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January expressing concerns about receiving less funding than expected from Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget plan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s budget proposal this year proposed only a 3 percent increase in funding allocated to the UC, down from 4 percent in years past. The state government typically increases UC funding to meet the ever-increasing number of enrolled students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been tabling and performing outreach to out of state students on our campus, and we’ve still yet to find anyone with 1,000 extra dollars floating around for next year’s tuition,” Spencer Brandt, UCSB Lobby Corps co-chair, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UC admits meeting after meeting that a tuition hike is a band aid solution to a long term problem, caused by 20+ years of gubernatorial and state legislative divestment,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite receiving less state funding than expected, Napolitano said the university is committed to adding an additional 2,000 undergraduate students and 500 graduate students for the fall of 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Too many people who control the higher education committees in the Assembly and the Senate use their platform to score political points against the UC, and President Napolitano,” Brandt said. “Then when we take students to the Capitol to meet with them, they point the finger at the UC. And that’s worked for them for a long time.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Lobby Corps has a message for those legislators: UCSB students are not stupid,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kristin Hsu, the external vice president of statewide affairs, has helped Lobby Corps prepare postcards asking students to “Fund the UC.” The postcards detail students’ demands and concerns and will be delivered to the state legislature at a conference next month, Hsu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What are the UC Regents expecting out of state students to sacrifice to pay for this tuition increase? The answer is physical and mental health, academic success, food and housing security,” Hsu said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, UC students are forced to pay for conflicts and disagreements among UCOP, the UC Regents, and the state legislature that we have no control over. That is an absolute shame,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will vote on an additional 2.7 percent tuition increase for in-state residents in May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lobby Corps Internal Director Mayela Morales and other UCSB students attended the public forum of Wednesday’s Regents meeting to protest the increase. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We might’ve lost with out-of-state students this time, but we also have the proposed in-state tuition increase coming up in the May Regents meeting,” Morales said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morales said that she plans to lobby representatives in Sacramento to “allocate the sufficient funding to the UC system in order to buy out the tuition hikes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an issue that needs to be targeted through various tactics, but we have to remember that if it has been stopped before, we can do it again,” she added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

day of Deltopia. <em>McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Lieutenant David Millard from UCPD said he anticipates about a 20 percent decrease in UCPD law enforcement, “depending on what the weekend is looking like.”</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Juan Camarena from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) added that the amount of IVFP officers will most likely be similar in numbers to last year; however, they do not plan to bring horses to the event.</p>\n<p>UCPD and IVFP plan to closely monitor social media to see if anything is posted about Deltopia weekend plans. What they see could determine the amount of law enforcement they deploy, according to Camarena.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the Isla Vista Community Services District (CSD) held a town hall to discuss police presence, parking restrictions, fencing, public concerns and the ideal Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Camarena and Millard also guaranteed that undocumented students will be safe from detainment due to immigration status, and they explained instances in which students will have to present identification to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“We come into contact with people that violate the law, we don’t care about their legal status,” Camarena said. “As long as they provide some type of ID that’s not fake.”</p>\n<p>To further enhance safety, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to have CSOs present at the Safety Station near Del Playa Drive on April 7, the day of Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Students at the town hall also expressed concerns regarding the amount of fencing put up the weekend of Deltopia, especially the fencing along El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>Jacob Lebell, an Isla Vista resident, said the fences were “insulting,” “unnecessary” and “intolerable.”</p>\n<p>In response to these complaints, the CSD unanimously passed a motion to direct staff to request that no fencing be installed on El Colegio Road during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Camarena revealed that barricades will be placed on Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road during the weekend and said any cars that leave that area during the weekend will not be allowed to re-enter due to concerns of cars being vandalized.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and the Isla Vista Tenants Union will be advertising for students not to park in those areas by going door-to-door, according to EVPLA Batsheva Labowe-Stoll.</p>\n<p>If cars are parked on Del Playa Drive and Sabado Tarde Road, they will not be towed, Camarena said.</p>\n<p>The CSD unanimously passed a third motion to direct staff to find alternative parking for residents. Director Spencer Brandt suggested that the parking lot of the Community Center be used as alternative parking for residents during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>A noise ordinance in Isla Vista will be in effect from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. throughout the weekend of Deltopia, according to Gina Fischer, representative for Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann.</p>\n<p>The CSD released an online survey to ask UCSB students about their plans for Deltopia and their opinions on police presence.</p>\n<p>Results from 335 responses revealed that the majority of students were unsatisfied with law enforcement presence during Deltopia last year; however, most students still said they felt safe throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>The survey also revealed that 64 percent of responders discourage their friends from visiting I.V. during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>The CSD emphasized that in order for an ideal Deltopia to become a reality, there must be a balance between the students’ desires and the community’s desires in regard to police presence.</p>\n<p>Last year, the university spent an estimated <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">$30,000 to $40,000</a> on advertisements urging visitors to stay away from Isla Vista during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>This year, the university expects to spend less on Deltopia ads — specifically, in the $20,000–$30,000 range, according to Andrea Estrada, UCSB director of news and media relations. A final figure will not be determined until after Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

They will also receive an advisor and a significant increase in funding.</p>\n<p>The resolution was authored by Matt Nielson, vice chair of the TSA, Julian Armada, chair of the TSA and Kian Maalizadeh and Ilene Ochoa, who are both A.S. Senate liaisons to the organization.</p>\n<p>The four worked on the resolution during Fall Quarter and filed a motion to get the TSA certified as a BCU.</p>\n<p>The amount of funding the TSA will receive is still being discussed. According to Armada, Maalizadeh first suggested that the budget should be around $20,000, but then expectations were lowered to $10,000.</p>\n<p>When the TSA was an entity of the Office of Student Life (OSL), their budget was no larger than $500, Armada explained.</p>\n<p>Prior to the TSA becoming an A.S. entity, they received their funding solely from fundraisers and donations.</p>\n<p>“We had to spend a lot of time raising money before we even put on events,” Nielson said.</p>\n<p>The TSA had their first meeting as a BCU on Monday, Feb. 12. Armada said he had seen an increase in membership since the TSA officially became a BCU.</p>\n<p>“It’s small now, but I’m hoping that their interest will keep growing,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re one of the only UCs who didn’t have a transfer organization as a part of the Associated Students… That was shocking to me considering how many transfer students are being accepted, and it’s only increasing each year,” he added.</p>\n<p>The previous board of the TSA had intended to make their organization an entity of A.S., but failed to do so due to a lack of guidance from Senate, according to Nielson.</p>\n<p>With the help of Maalizadeh and Ochoa, the TSA was able to draft the proposal and complete the internal paperwork needed.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the things we want to do is just advocate for resources. With transfers, there’s no centralized voice,” Maalizadeh said. “There’s only so much a single person can do, but there’s so much that an organized group can do.”</p>\n<p>Maalizadeh envisions the TSA using its position in A.S. not just to hold community events, but also to advocate for resources such as more tutoring services and a better transfer student orientation.</p>\n<p>The TSA plans to work with the Transfer Student Center (TSC) by collaborating on events and utilizing the resources provided by the center.</p>\n<p>“Right now, I am a Transfer Peer Educator at the TSC, and I felt a division with the two even though we are serving the same constituents,” Ochoa said. “Now, I hope having a TSC liaison with the TSA will create more of a bond and collaborative efforts.”</p>\n<p>All four authors of the resolution emphasized that they hope to see transfer students having a larger presence on campus now that they have adequate representation in A.S.</p>\n<p>“Transfers come from everywhere, but we all have the same common identity of being a transfer,” Maalizadeh said. “I want to make sure that when people go to UCSB as a transfer, they aren’t an afterthought.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg.4 of the Feb. 15 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Yang during a May 2017 sit-in. Yang agreed to the demands but students are still concerned that the university has not taken enough action to reform sexual assault policies. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students at a town hall on Thursday continued to express their frustration with UC Santa Barbara administration, which they say has not fully addressed previously agreed-upon demands to reform sexual assault policies at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall, hosted by Student Activist Network, addressed one of the demands, which requires UC President Janet Napolitano to tour sexual assault and sexual violence town halls on UC campuses once a year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robin Holmes Sullivan, vice president for Student Affairs at the University of California Office of the President (UCOP), attended the town hall as a representative for Napolitano.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students initially presented the demands to Chancellor Henry T. Yang during at a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 2017 sit- in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These demands elaborated on a previous list of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/nowUCsb13InitialDemandsforChancellorYang.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13 demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which students presented to Yang at a May 2015 sit-in in Cheadle Hall. In both cases, Yang agreed to the students’ demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel was composed of UCSB administrators, Title IX Student Advisory Board representative Jennifer Selvidge and Ro’Shawndra Earvin, who led the initial sit-in when Chancellor Yang signed the 2017 list of demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang did not attend the meeting because he was in Sacramento advocating for UC funding, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn explained at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said Yang had made a personal commitment to Earvin prior to the town hall that he would raise money for the Survivor Fund at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, Earvin posted on social media a screenshot of an email she had sent to Yang, in which she told the chancellor that he had been unresponsive to her emails. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It worries me that you have not consistently followed up with the issues presented to you on that day,” she wrote. ”I am sure you understand that directing me to your assistants is insufficient, as your name is on the contract as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn said all of the demands from 2015 had been addressed. Some of the demands from last May are still in progress, like a demand for a Survivor Resource Center and an Isla Vista report card for sexual assault incidents, she said. She suggested partnering with a family justice center to address the former demand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Selvidge disagreed with Klawunn and said three of the original 13 demands have still not been met. Selvidge, who told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">she is a survivor of assault, read through the demands she considers incomplete.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the demands requires increasing female presence on the I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) and training all IVFP personnel to deal with sexual violence and harassment. Another states that there should be accountability and oversight of the Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA) for past mishandling of sexual assault cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still another of these demands requires placing an additional Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education Office (C.A.R.E.) advocate in the Santa Catalina Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just need the university to run what they signed for,” Earvin said. “That’s the reason why I am here. Our agenda is ‘demand completion.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earvin also expressed frustration that her name had been used without her permission in an Associated Students (A.S.) Senate resolution. The resolution proposed using a mobile application called Sprigeo to combat sexual assault and sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Kristen Armellini and Grecia Martinez authored the resolution, which was presented at the Feb. 7 Senate meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have never felt so disrespected,” Earvin said. “Apparently you had a story when you created the app, why did you use my story?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Feb. 7 meeting, UCSB alumna Alejandra Melgoza also expressed concern  because her name was mentioned in the resolution without her permission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Using my name without consent is perpetuating the same acts of violence,” Melgoza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Alexandra Gessesse and Andrea Reyes said the authors of the resolution should have approached the individuals before including their names. Gessesse said that regardless of when the resolution was written, the fact that Earvin and Melgoza had not been contacted was “exploitation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earvin emphasized that her main initiative since the May sit-in was to fulfill the list of demands, including full payment of her UC tuition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Run that tuition and run this resource center,” Earvin said. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“Not enough [people] participate in the resistance against the continuation of the perpetuation of rape culture,” said Ro’Shawndra Earvin, a UCSB student and a lead speaker at May’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">sit-in</a>, as she opened the meeting with a statement expressing her continued frustration.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara administrators led Tuesday’s panel in Harold Frank Hall, speaking on behalf of Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs, also presented updates on each of the demands.</p>\n<p>The panel included Katya Armistead, dean of student life; Kim Equinoa, assistant dean of students; Briana Conway, director of Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.); Jeanne Stanford, director of Counseling and Psychological Services; Diane O’Brien, executive assistant to Yang<strong>; </strong>and Cathy Farley, assistant chief for the UC Police Department.</p>\n<p>Earvin expressed her frustration at the university’s handling of the demands, saying Armistead failed to solicit students to join committees to comply with the demands through a university announcement.</p>\n<p>“Ro Earvin, in unity with the A.N.W.O branch of UCSB and the Student Activist Network are looking for students interested in working on committees created for the demands signed May 4th 2017 in response to the University’s response to Sexual Assault. And for more information to contact me at <em>r.smivsb@gmail.com</em> with the demand(s) interested in working on and a schedule,” Earvin said in her email to UC administration.</p>\n<p>Armistead said she misunderstood Earvin’s request and sent out an email advertising Tuesday’s town hall to all students.</p>\n<p>Following Earvin’s opening statement, attendees received updates on each of the 12 demands made by nowUCsb, an organization which strives to “expose and reform broken campus policies on sexual violence” according to the group’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>The administration marked each demand as “incomplete,” “complete” or “in progress.” The panel then provided specific information on the progress of each demand.</p>\n<p>The first demand was to create and fund a survivor resource center in Isla Vista. According to Klawunn, the university provides legal and counseling services for survivors, despite there being no “one-stop shop” for these resources. The demand was marked as incomplete, but the panel said it was interested in looking further into the matter.</p>\n<p>The second demand, which said C.A.P.S. must provide adequate and timely mental health services to survivors and their families, was marked as in progress.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. Director Conway said the organization now has eight staff members, which she described as its largest staff ever. She said C.A.P.S. has also diversified the days and times for group counseling and activities.</p>\n<p>The third demand sought mandatory sensitivity trainings for UCPD and the I.V. Foot Patrol that address race, gender, class and sexuality in connection to sexual assault and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>Assistant UCPD Chief Farley said UCPD and the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office attended a three-day training this August. Additionally, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/detective-joins-ivfp-following-student-protests-demands/\">IVFP hired a new detective</a>, Julio Gutierrez, to handle sexual assault and interpersonal violence in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said demand four, asking Santa Barbara City College to be more transparent about students who have been disciplined for Title IX violations, is complete.</p>\n<p>UCSB Title IX director Ariana Alvarez will be collaborating with the Title IX director at SBCC.</p>\n<p>The seventh demand, for survivors of sexual assault and interpersonal violence to be able to transfer to a different university, is already in practice, Klawunn said. The UC facilitates UC-to-UC transfers for survivors.</p>\n<p>Demand 10, which required integrating Queer Connect, an educational workshop that focuses on sexual assault, dating violence and stalking within LGBTQ communities, to reporting and trainings, was also implemented and officially began at the beginning of Fall Quarter, according to Conway.</p>\n<p>The remaining seven demands were marked incomplete, but members of the panel assured those in attendance they are working to meet them.</p>\n<p>Demand six ordered administration to work with the I.V. CSD to create a report card for government institutions and law enforcement agencies for behaviors and education surrounding rape and sexual assault in I.V. Earvin marked that demand six has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p>The university is unable to meet demand eight for increased lighting on Slough Road because the Coastal Commission will not approve the change in infrastructure, according to Klawunn.</p>\n<p>Demand nine, to organize a meeting with all UC Chancellors on our UC Santa Barbara campus to develop system-wide level change, was not met “the way the demand is written,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>A UC-level sexual assault policy training review was held in September.</p>\n<p>Demand 11 asked the UC president to conduct yearly campus tours, where they should hold a public sexual violence town hall at every UC campus once per year.</p>\n<p>Robin Holmes-Sullivan, UC vice president for student affairs, will instead hold a town hall at UCSB on Jan. 8.</p>\n<p>Demand 12 requested Chancellor Yang and his office regularly update students about the progress being made on these demands. Klawunn said the demand was incomplete and said Tuesday’s town hall was one way to update the public.</p>\n<p>After the panel discussed their progress on each of the 12 demands, the floor became open for the approximately 30 students present to ask questions. The panel also answered anonymously submitted questions.</p>\n<p>Attendees asked why the UC administration has the funds for <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/\">Halloween ads</a> but not to meet the 12 demands. Others asked whether programs like Gaucho FYI and Haven are enough to combat rape culture.</p>\n<p>The public made suggestions to the panel regarding addressing rape culture at places like the Student Leadership Retreat, where many leaders of organizations gather for training each year.</p>\n<p>They also mentioned the newly-introduced UC Title IX Student Advisory Board and asked if the students chosen to serve on this board would be compensated for the time commitment required to be on the board.</p>\n<p>Armistead agreed that students who serve on the board should be compensated.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.

felt they had a voice in these important issues and establish a mechanism for us to share information to the students about what is happening in this area,” UC Systemwide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>The board will consist of one undergraduate and one graduate student from each UC campus, making a total of 19 board members. <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KP3WLYN\">Applications</a> are due on Thursday, Nov. 30 at 5 p.m., and the selected board members will receive news of their acceptance in January.</p>\n<p>Board members will serve for one year with the exception of board members chosen in January, who will serve a year and a half term.</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students (A.S.) President Hieu Le, he and other stakeholders worked with Salvaty and Title IX Program Coordinator Evelyn Cheng to create the board.</p>\n<p>He added that SAB members will be able to hold decision-makers accountable, as they will be involved in the “procedures, implementation and enforcement of both Title IX and the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence.”</p>\n<p>Le said he was involved in discussing the board’s duties and the qualifications for those who will serve. Board members must be heavily involved within their student communities and have expertise on issues relating to sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The University of California Title IX Office, responsible for <a href=\"http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SVSH\">UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment</a>, will seek critical feedback from the board.</p>\n<p>Board members are expected to provide information to their campuses regarding sexual violence and sexual harassment response and prevention efforts being made by the system-wide office.</p>\n<p>A panel of UC Santa Barbara administration members said the board members should be compensated at a town hall meeting that took place on Tuesday, Nov. 14, which focused on updates regarding the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nowUCsbDemands2.0May32017.pdf\">sexual assault demands</a> made by nowUCsb during their <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\">sit-in this May</a>.</p>\n<p>The panel agreed to deliver the message to the administration in charge of the SAB.</p>\n<p>“This is a volunteer board,” Salvaty emailed when asked whether she believed that the students on the board should be paid.</p>\n<p>“I am really looking forward to working with and learning from the student board members.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.7 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simren-verma-profile-pic-.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/simrenverma/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Simren Verma</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Simren Verma currently serves as the University News Editor.
