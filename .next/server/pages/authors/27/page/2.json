Some lost friends and others were stranded south of the freeway closure, forced to rely on alternate forms of transportation to reach campus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TRAPPED</strong></p>\n<p>While many students fled the fires by going back to their hometowns, most faculty and staff did not have that option.</p>\n<p>“I went stir crazy,” said Janet Mizrahi, a professor in the writing department, in an email. “I continued to meet my goal of 10,000 steps daily by listening to an audiobook while I walked in circles in my small house! My dog thought I was nuts!”</p>\n<p>For Nomi Morris, another professor in the writing department who lives in Upper Ojai, the fire originated near Ojai and blazed through her neighborhood, giving her only a half an hour to gather her belongings. While her own street was spared, many houses in her neighborhood were destroyed.</p>\n<p>She first evacuated her home and came to Goleta with her family, until the unhealthy air quality pushed them to move further north and stay with a family friend.</p>\n<p>Some professors living in voluntary evacuation zones also had to leave their homes just before finals week. Many made their exams optional or changed them to take-home finals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TRANSPORTATION DIFFICULTIES</strong></p>\n<p>The mudslides in January also made it difficult for many faculty and staff to get to campus.</p>\n<p>Writing professor Ilene Miele was forced to drive through Ventura during the Thomas Fire until she ultimately decided to cancel class for a day because of the fire’s proximity to Route 101. For the past week, she has been taking the ferry to Santa Barbara, initially relying on a colleague to drive her to campus before learning about a UCSB shuttle service at the Santa Barbara Harbor.</p>\n<p>“What caused the most anxiety for me, at first, was not knowing how I would get there and make it to the first day of class,” Miele said in an email. “The first day they warned us to expect a rocky ride, but it was a fairly gentle roll … Overall, I was fortunate that we had good weather and the rides were fairly quick (an hour and a half each way).”</p>\n<p>Morris stayed in Santa Barbara for the first week of the quarter due to closed roads and classes that end too late for her to take a train back.</p>\n<p>According to Mary Ferris, executive director of Student Health Service, staff at Student Health also faced exceptional difficulty ensuring coverage with blocked roads and the recent flu outbreaks. Understaffing, combined with increased demand stretched the staff thin, resulting in longer hours.</p>\n<p>She said that because of the staff’s commitment to health, they went to extreme lengths to reach campus, with some staff staying overnight in Santa Barbara for the week. One pharmacist even flew to Santa Barbara from Oxnard in the morning.</p>\n<p>“Every day was a new challenge,” Ferris said. “When you’re in healthcare you can’t just close.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>EMOTIONAL IMPACT</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond physical losses, the constant evacuations and impacted schedules have taken an emotional toll on staff and faculty.</p>\n<p>“I managed to stay calm from day to day, but never quite sure when and if I would freak out,” Paul Sonnino, a professor in the history department, said in an email. “Haven’t yet, but the sense of uncertainty is taking its toll.”</p>\n<p>Mizrahi lost a close personal friend who was swept away by the mudslide.</p>\n<p>“Losing a contemporary is a devastating kind of loss — after all, it so easily could have been me,” she said in an email. “It’s emotionally devastating.”</p>\n<p>For Miele, her experiences being blocked from campus and driving through the fire have left her uncertain.</p>\n<p>“These days when I get on the 101, I think of it as the highway of doubt. Depending on the conditions, you’re never quite sure whether you’ll get there or if you’ll get home,” she said. “Much as I know we need the rain in Southern California, I’ll be glad when winter is over this year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>RETURNING TO CAMPUS</strong></p>\n<p>Some professors also faced backlash from students over the cancellation of classes and office hours.</p>\n<p>“Some insensitive students — just a couple — got very upset because I did not give them automatic ‘A’s as compensation for my having had to cancel some office hours since the fire was approaching my house,” Sonnino said in an email.</p>\n<p>Other professors greatly enjoyed returning to campus, with students expressing concern for their well-being.</p>\n<p>“It was a relief to see young people, you know, hear the regular questions, and I’m enjoying my students immensely,” Mizrahi said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UNIVERSITY RESPONSE</strong></p>\n<p>Under the difficult circumstances, many praised the university for offering financial assistance through a special fund for faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Some, however, have raised concerns about the speed at which UCSB made decisions.</p>\n<p>“As a faculty member I had the flexibility to cancel classes when I thought it was unsafe, but I know that staff members did not necessarily have that same flexibility,” Miele said. “So, while I understand that there are many complexities involved, I have concerns about the university’s ability to respond more quickly.”</p>\n<p>Despite the financial assistance, the experience has been challenging for those who were blocked by the roads.</p>\n<p>“The university has been terrific, but it is draining, it is stressful [and] it is harder to work. We’re all doing our best,” Morris said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>LOOKING BACK</strong></p>\n<p>Overwhelmingly, faculty and staff echoed the same sentiment — things could have been worse.</p>\n<p>“I just continually have this feeling that I got off easy,” said Morris, grateful that she still has her home, despite the lingering smell of smoke. “I just really want to make this clear that compared to what the people in Montecito are going through, I went through nothing.”</p>\n<p>Sonnino echoed similar sentiments, saying that compared to tragedies around the world, losing utilities at his house or a nearby bridge shattering are insignificant.</p>\n<p>“It only made me aware of how much worse off are people in Aleppo, Israel, Palestine, Puerto Rico, Seoul and other places who live under imminent threat day in and day out,” he said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>MOVING FORWARD</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone copes with tragedy in different ways.</p>\n<p>Assistant professor Leah Stokes was pushed into action after a frustrated tweet about climate change garnered positive responses.</p>\n<p>Her op-ed in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, titled “Climate Change in my Backyard,” addresses the impact of climate change on recent climate disruptions, and acts as a “call to action,” urging people to focus more on environmental policy.</p>\n<p>“You just need one degree of separation to meet someone affected by this,” Stokes said. “My op-ed is about changing people’s minds, about how we talk about these events.”</p>\n<p>She hopes that people will speak out and influence others to understand that blaming Montecito residents for not evacuating is simple. Instead, she said, people need to understand the greater causes behind the devastation.</p>\n<p>Others focused on philanthropy and helping their community. Morris personally raised over $3,000 for two people who she knew were in need.</p>\n<p>For Mizrahi, the loss of her friend has pushed her to embrace the present.</p>\n<p>“For me, it just made me focus on right now and living,” she said. “It’s like I got a fire built under my butt … I’m not waiting, I’m not waiting, I’m just doing it now — because who knows what tomorrow will bring?”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

All water activities such as swimming and surfing and are highly discouraged.</p>\n<p>Eight beaches in Santa Barbara County were closed. Bacteria levels are lower than they were when tested last week and six more beaches have been opened, including Sands Beach at Coal Oil Point. Goleta, Carpinteria and Hope Ranch beaches remain closed.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Public Health Department is unsure of how much untreated sewage and chemical contamination is in the water because of the devastating effects of the Thomas Fire and significant amounts of rain, according to a press release on Wednesday. The agency is urging the public to avoid contact with any sand or water that looks or smells unusual.</p>\n<p>In an “abundance of caution” and to help with recovery, the department is also urging the public to stay out of the 400-foot buffer zone on each side of the beach where sediment from the mudflows is being deposited . The buffer zone is clearly marked with orange fencing.</p>\n<p>Ocean water will continue to be tested for microbial contaminants until the beaches are determined to be safe. While there has been significant improvement since last week, it is still unclear when the beaches will be reopened.</p>\n<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, coliforms are bacteria generally not considered harmful towards humans. However, increased amounts of coliforms can be indicators of other bacteria, viruses and parasites generally known as pathogens that can cause illness.</p>\n<p>Susan Klein-Rothschild, deputy director of the Santa Barbara Public Health Department, said that this bacteria is generally filtered out through the soil, but that their presence in the water could indicate the presence of sewage waste or feces.</p>\n<p>Beaches in Goleta, Carpinteria and Hammond had more than double the state health standard of coliform, with the rest of the beaches coming in under the standard.</p>\n<p>According to Klein-Rothschild, the amount of coliform was too high to be counted, which was a cause for “serious concern.”</p>\n<p>According to the Center for Disease Control, enterococci are generally found in the bowel and can be collected from water and vegetation generally as a result of contamination from untreated sewage.</p>\n<p>While the standard for enterococcus contamination is 104 MPN, water tests at Goleta Beach show over 24,000 MPN. This is more than 200 times the acceptable limits. In Carpinteria, enterococcus is lower, but still 10 times the acceptable limit.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t go in that water, and I wouldn’t want anyone I care about to go in that water either,” Klein-Rothschild said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The dining commons’ construction is a part of the larger San Joaquin Apartments construction that will also be completed for Fall Quarter. UC Santa Barbara has four dining commons across campus, and the building construction will make Portola the university’s largest dining common.</p>\n<p>The Portola Dining Commons are located near the Santa Catalina freshmen dorms on El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the building construction cost approximately $20.37 million.</p>\n<p>The original design of the dining commons began in 2013, according to KieranTimberlake, the architecture firm that designed Portola. Construction began in 2015 after the firm completed the building design in 2014.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited to see this project come to life,” Jill Horst, director of dining services, said in an email. “I can’t wait for our guests to walk [through] the doors and experience this amazing venue while exploring a culinary feast-food innovation at its best with flavors forward.”</p>\n<p>According to Horst, the old dining commons contained approximately 450 seats, while the new building has 600 indoor seats and 200 seats on the outdoor patio. The university is in the process of hiring more student and full-time employees to accommodate the increase in the dining commons’ capacity.</p>\n<p>The Portola Dining Commons will be supplied with specialized cooking equipment, including a tandoori oven, rotisserie oven and tortilla machine in the bakery.</p>\n<p>Students will also be able to see their food prepared through the six open kitchens, said Carin Whitney, spokesperson from KieranTimberlake, adding that the cooking and serving areas of the dining commons are “integral” to its overall design.</p>\n<p>“The culinary experience is architectural,” Whitney said in an email.</p>\n<p>Whitney said the university and architecture team considered the dining commons’ environmental effects in its design and operation, including energy-efficient cooking equipment, sustainable food service practices and a solar hot water system for washing dishes.</p>\n<p>“The team expects high performance benchmarks once [the] building opens for service,” Whitney said in an email.</p>\n<p><em>Update: The cost of the Portola Dining Commons’ construction was unavailable at the time of publication and has since been added to the article. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, August 24, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

it should be cheaper or even free.”</p>\n<p>Along with the $79.99 purchase of commencement regalia from the UCen Bookstore, which includes the graduation stole, tassel, cap and gown, the increased demand for lodging inflates the prices of hotels for families and friends.</p>\n<p>Frank Duffy, a manager at the Hampton Inn Santa Barbara/Goleta, said the hotel management increases room prices by about $100 per night for graduation weekend.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson from the Kimpton Goodland accounting department said when demand increases, prices also increase based off the hotel’s capacity.</p>\n<p>A manager at the Goleta Courtyard Marriott also said they take the market price of hotel rooms into consideration when they set their prices.</p>\n<p>This price increase, however, does not seem to affect local Airbnbs because of the consistent shifts in supply and lodging capacity.</p>\n<p>According to an Airbnb press release with data from Smith Travel Research, the average cost of an Airbnb room was $162 in 2016, while the average price of a hotel room was $367.</p>\n<p>This data includes hotels only from the city of Santa Barbara, not the county.</p>\n<p>“Our hosts typically do not raise their prices. If they do, it’s very, very slightly,” said Jasmine Mora, an Airbnb spokesperson. “As a consumer you’re just not going to book that listing.”</p>\n<p>The lower prices are also because more hosts are signing up for Airbnb to rent out their rooms.</p>\n<p>According to Airbnb, 9 percent of users rented out Airbnb rooms for the first time during graduation weekend. This increase in supply helps to accommodate the increase in demand without over-inflating prices.</p>\n<p>However, not all travel and lodging services are increasing prices in preparation for graduation weekend.</p>\n<p>Deanna Zachrisson, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Airport, said she did not see a correlation between graduation weekend and increased flight prices.</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole number of factors that influence the prices of tickets,” she said. “It also can be the size of the aircraft … it’s really impossible to say that there’s a direct correlation between graduation traffic and cost.”</p>\n<p>Zachrisson also said college students make up a low percentage of the airport’s customers.</p>\n<p>Some graduation fees imposed by the university are charged only out of necessity, not to profit off of students.</p>\n<p>The Office of the Registrar charges an approximately $19 fee to every student graduating in order to process and send them their diplomas. The fee is an average rate to accommodate everyone, including those from smaller classes and international students that have more expensive shipping costs.</p>\n<p>She said diplomas for large graduating class sizes are cheaper than smaller class sizes because it is less expensive to buy in bulk.</p>\n<p>“It basically goes to cover the cost of the vendor for handling and mailing the diploma,” said the Uuniversity Registrar Leesa Beck. “You wouldn’t want someone to just drop your diploma in a manila envelope and drop it in a mailbox.”</p>\n<p>Beck said the diplomas are printed and sent by a third-party, out-of-state vendor.</p>\n<p>She also said it was “hard to say” if the total $19 goes directly to diplomas since the prices vary depending on graduating class and international shipping rates.</p>\n<p>Replacement diplomas are considerably more expensive at $50 domestically and $75 internationally, which Beck said was partly a “deterrent fee” meant to stop students from ordering multiple copies of their diploma, since they are only supposed to have one. She said this also works to prevent diploma fraud.</p>\n<p>Beck said if students can prove their diploma was lost or destroyed, the university frequently waives the fee.</p>\n<p>These costs only include the graduation essentials; however, an extra stole is sold at the Bookstore for $29.99 and a Classic Diploma Frame costs $150 and does not qualify for free shipping.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the June 8, 2017, print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Office of the President.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“True to the university’s mission, our nonresident enrollment policy underscores our unwavering commitment to the students of the state … i</span>t also reaffirms our pledge that nonresident students will be enrolled only in addition to, and never in place of, Californians,” UC President Janet Napolitano said in a statement.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cap was first </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/enrollment-cap-proposed/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discussed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the Regents in March, when it was proposed to cap nonresident enrollment at 20 percent across all campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four campuses including Berkeley, Los Angeles, Irvine and San Diego currently surpass this enrollment cap and are capped at their current percentage of nonresident enrollment under the new policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley has the highest number of nonresident students, making up 22.4 percent of the student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the press release, this cap is in response to the state’s Budget Act of 2016. The act </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">requested that the Regents limit the number of undergraduate nonresidents in return for $18.5 million to support the enrollment of 2,500 more California undergraduates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our new nonresident enrollment policy strikes the right balance between UC’s continued commitment to putting California students first and the significant benefits that out-of-state and international students provide the university,” Napolitano said in a statement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policy also calls for the Regents to review the cap every four years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system is on track to enroll 2,500 more undergraduates in the fall of 2017, following a dramatic jump of 7,500 new undergraduates enrolled in fall 2016.

The public forum ended with police threatening protesters with arrest.</p>\n<p>Security personnel checked students before they were permitted to enter the public forum. The search included wanding students with hand-held metal detectors and forcing them to leave food and drinks outside the forum.</p>\n<p>The forum began at approximately 8 a.m. with 38 people signed up to speak. Individuals were permitted to speak for one minute, while groups of two or more who chose to combine their time received two-and-a-half minutes to speak.</p>\n<p>Several students spoke about divesting from fossil fuels, with one student expressing outrage that UC administration claimed it would be too difficult to divest.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think climate change is complicated when we’re talking about a simple divestment,” said a student from UC Santa Cruz Fossil Free. “I think that when you have a top team of investors you can find out how you can divest over seven years and make a public politicized statement, because that is what we are asking you to do.”</p>\n<p>There were also speakers who were angered by the tuition increases in the wake of the audit.</p>\n<p>“We have to question why tuition increases are disproportionate to state disinvestment,” Taylor Chanes, the Associated Students external vice president at UC Irvine, said. “I don’t understand why we have a proposed increase in 2014 and another one in 2017 when we have millions of dollars in a reserve, whether or not that is supposed to go towards funding different programs for students that you are already under-resourcing.”</p>\n<p>The Regents will discuss the audit more thoroughly on Thursday.</p>\n<p>There were also several comments regarding UC President Janet Napolitano’s salary, including one graduate student who referenced the low wages made by teaching assistants.</p>\n<p>There were also calls for Napolitano’s resignation.</p>\n<p>“I think you need to resign, first of all,” one man said, prompting applause at the meeting. “I also think there needs to be a criminal investigation.”<br>\nSeveral speakers went over their allotted time and were asked to stop.</p>\n<p>After public comment, while Regent Chair Lozano was thanking those that spoke, one audience member stood up and began to chant, “Whose university?”<br>\nOther audience members immediately caught on and started chanting back “Our university.”</p>\n<p>As the chants grew, the room became more hectic. A reporter from UC Santa Cruz jumped over the barrier separating the crowd from the Regents in an attempt to get a photo. He was reprimanded by police.</p>\n<p>Despite Regent Chair Lozano’s attempts to speak, she was drowned out by the protesters. A police officer then stood in front of the crowd reading the rules of conduct, before telling the protesters that the police would begin arresting participants if they did not leave in five minutes.</p>\n<p>The Regents left the room at this time.</p>\n<p>“As far as Regents meetings go, unfortunately, it seems standard that you know, the meeting is shut down and the Regents leave and don’t really pay attention to us,” Michael Kile, who organized the protest with Gabriela Romo, said.</p>\n<p>“The way that Regents set up their meetings they set them up to minimize the public’s kind of view of that” Romo said. “The fact that they shut down the meeting shows that they’re clearly scared that people are out there and pushing for you know maybe the right side of history.”</p>\n<p>The chanting continued for two more minutes while the police counted down the minutes. Protesters filed out while chanting and all had left the room by the five-minute mark.</p>\n<p>Police did not make any arrests.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Current club president Rex Luan (right) faces off against Stephen Hu (left) in a match of Go, a game created in China around 2,500 years ago. In April, both Luan and Hu leed UCSB’s Go Club to a championship victory in the last round of the Collegiate Go League. Hu is set to be president of the small but successful club next year. <em>Tamari Dzotsenidze / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Facing off against each other, Rex Luan and Stephen Hu, current and future president of UC Santa Barbara’s Go Club, sit in perfect contrast.</p>\n<p>Playing with white stones and clad in black, Luan sits quietly and seriously, contemplating his next move. Wearing a patterned shirt and a Go tie, his partner looks at me and grins.</p>\n<p>“When Rex gets into the game, his face gets red. The redder he is, the better he plays,” Hu says.</p>\n<p>Though small in numbers, UCSB Go Club makes up for it with heart.</p>\n<p>Luan was only six years old when he was first exposed to Go, and for him it was love at first sight. He began spending four hours a week in lessons with a professional player, reviewing games and practicing with fellow students.</p>\n<p>It was this dedication that led the Go Club to victory this April.</p>\n<p>Along with club member Justin Shieh, Hu and Luan made up the team that narrowly defeated the University of Toronto and claimed victory in the final round of the Collegiate Go League.</p>\n<p>Both Shieh and Hu have similar origin stories. Hu was first introduced to Go when he was four. He said an elderly cook at his kindergarten in Beijing was the first to teach him the game, and he then began playing with his father.</p>\n<p>Shieh, who was first exposed to the game in Mandarin school at the age of eight, said he fell into it almost “by accident.” He said he started playing around the age of nine or ten and played seriously for nine years.</p>\n<p>Go originated in ancient China, and, according to the club members, is easy to learn but difficult to master. Although the game may seem simple, with a wooden board and black and white pieces, its appearance is deceiving.</p>\n<p>According to the American Go Association, it is “the most complex of all games.”</p>\n<p>Google recently developed an artificial intelligence system called AlphaGo that was able to beat one of the top ranked Go players. In two weeks, it will take on the highest ranked Go player in the world, Ke Jie.</p>\n<p>Not only has AlphaGo made a splash in the international Go community, but it has also inspired Luan, a computer engineering major, to share his love of the game and continue learning about the mathematics behind it.</p>\n<p>“I want to spread this culture to other places in UCSB and introduce it to more people,” Luan said. “Go itself contains a lot of wisdom. Many people try to break it, break its algorithm … I tried to attempt to break its algorithm, too … but I’m still studying for it.”</p>\n<h6><center><img data-attachment-id=\"77809\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/playful-wisdom-go-club-and-its-quiet-success/howtoplaygo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?fit=999%2C670&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"999,670\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"howtoplaygo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?fit=888%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-77809\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?resize=700%2C469\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/howtoplaygo.jpg?resize=768%2C515&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></center></h6>\n<p>Beyond algorithms, Go also inspires passion within the club members.</p>\n<p>Shieh said his demanding work schedule often prevents him from attending meetings and limits his ability to practice, but he still plays with the Go Club because of the team’s friendship.</p>\n<p>For others, the love of the game extends past the fun and competition and relates back to real life.</p>\n<p>“I just think that Go has so many parallels to life; it has many metaphors,” Hu said. “In the global sense, you have to give up something, and this relates to life. You have to give up maybe what’s less important in the moment and just focus on what’s larger. And it hurts to give up things, it really does, but sometimes you have to.”</p>\n<p>This love and fascination with Go manifests through continued practice. Hu plays one game a day, averaging around an hour and a half per game.</p>\n<p>Despite the time commitment and preparation for competition, however, the road to victory was riddled with challenges.</p>\n<p>The team is split into different “boards,” with the strongest player playing the first board. For Hu, this posed significant challenges due to the high skill level of players from other schools.</p>\n<p>When competing against UC Berkeley, Hu said he faced off against a professional player, which proved to be an intimidating task.</p>\n<p>“With Go, there’s no luck; if you lose, that means you have certainly done something wrong,” Hu said. “You just played unfavorably compared to your opponent … I didn’t feel too bad because I was playing a pro, and I don’t spend all day playing this game.”</p>\n<p>“But then again, I really felt during those weeks it was comradery and team spirit that really carried us through,” Hu added, showing the club’s sense of togetherness that has developed through days of practice.</p>\n<p>Described by Hu as a “dark horse,” UCSB’s Go Club was not expected to win the competition. It ranked fifth after the normal season, but after a months-long campaign that began in October, a narrow victory by Shieh clinched their two-to-one victory over University of Toronto.</p>\n<p>“It came down to the last move,” Hu said. “I felt surprisingly calm after that. I wasn’t, like, too ecstatic. The previous night, I thought that if we won this I would like erupt with a cheer, but I didn’t. I guess, at the moment, I just couldn’t take the enormity of that.”</p>\n<p>With Shieh and Luan graduating after this quarter, the future of Go Club remains uncertain. With fewer than 10 members regularly attending meetings, forming a team remains a challenge.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a popular game by any means,” Shieh said.</p>\n<p>Yet poised to take over as president, Hu said he is not worried about the amount of members the team will have in the future or protecting its title.</p>\n<p>“With every club, people graduate, people come and go … including myself,” Hu said. “If we win it next year or have a good result next time, then it’s going to feel good. But the first chance we got is really the most memorable one, and we seized it.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, May 11, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

Looking back on their campaign platforms, we asked our elected officials to tell us about their successes and shortfalls throughout their terms in office.</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Only months after taking office, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) Neha Nayak and her office were hit with a massive “curveball”: President Trump’s election.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It changed the course of how my office and UCSA and USSA wanted to steer our general goals,” Nayak said. “Essentially, now it was like, ‘We have to protect our students, and we have to protect individuals on campus that are threatened by our new federal government.’”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In response to the election, Nayak prioritized students who were directly affected by taking “preemptive measures,” including lobbying with other EVPSAs to ensure that UCs become sanctuaries.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77399\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77399\" data-attachment-id=\"77399\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-external-vice-president-of-student-affairs-neha-nayak/as-nayak-candidate-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?fit=1343%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1343,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS-nayak-Candidate-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?fit=164%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?fit=672%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77399\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7-672x1024.jpg?resize=600%2C915\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"915\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?resize=672%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 672w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?resize=164%2C250&amp;ssl=1 164w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1171&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AS-nayak-Candidate-7.jpg?w=1343&amp;ssl=1 1343w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77399\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">However, despite this shift, Nayak was still able to make strides in increasing mental health resources and the creation of the Federal Advocacy Program.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We really wanted to have an advocacy program that in a sense doesn’t just reach out to students in A.S. but to individuals that are not necessarily involved in student government, but that have these stories that can be an interesting and compelling story for a federal legislator,” Nayak said. “So if we go to, like, a representative, a congressman, you know, having someone that personally has dealt with being a refugee is more compelling.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The program launched earlier this year. According to Deputy Chief of Staff Maya Halthore, 60-70 students applied and 40 were able to go to Washington D.C. with USSA in March to lobby for Pell Grant expansion and protection, increased financial aid and DACA protection for undocumented students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her term, Nayak also focused on mental health through Chai Talks and a S.T.E.M. mental health panel.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“In terms of Chai Talks, I think it’s important to have a space on campus where students can speak on islamophobia, parental pressure, just things South Asian students, things that are related to their communities specifically, and I think that has been something that has not been spoken of or vocally emphasized” Nayak said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also takes pride in her S.T.E.M. mental health panel, which just started this quarter. She described it as a “working group” that meets every quarter to ensure that students within S.T.E.M. programs are aware of mental health resources.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I did what I wanted to do,” Nayak said, but she still wishes she could have done more regarding tracking legislation and voter registration.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Having a lot more internal communication with other entities that are already doing voter reg. is very important, and I could have improved on that,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She also said that she wished she had further increased student outreach to ensure that different students and “young student leaders” are applying to attend various conferences instead of the same people going multiple times.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kristin Hsu, the EVPSA chief of staff, also believes there are things that could have been done better.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Not everyone’s perfect, and I think Neha knows she’s not perfect,” said Hsu. “I think we could have done more outreach; we could have perhaps recruited more student leaders within the office; we could have gotten more staff members in the office … I think as long as you are constantly trying and making those efforts to do that outreach and go to meetings, to advertise whatever opportunities you have, you are doing your job.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s hard, because EVPSA is such a broad scope,” Nayak said. For the future, she hopes that the next EVPSA can create an easily accessible bill tracker to make students aware of legislation that may affect them.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite the setbacks, she is leaving behind a positive legacy with her staff.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I loved working with Neha. Obviously, entering EVPSA, there were bumps in the road with all of us, but Neha consistently served as a positive force within the office, being encouraging and present,” said Halthore.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As a graduating senior, Nayak looks toward a future away from politics, likely in marketing. She said, “maybe in the way future, [she’ll] run for office, for, like, state congress, but not anytime soon, that’s for sure.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Despite her reluctance to go into politics, she believes her experience working within A.S. and as EVPSA will guide her in her life.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“That’s something I’ll take for the rest of my life: just the knowledge of knowing how to be involved in these different communities, help these communities on campus, attend board meetings all across the state, fly to D.C. to advocate for issues that are so important to students and are essentially the lifeline of students. That has been such a growing experience for me.

UCOP allegedly removed campus statements that were critical of UCOP, sending more positive, edited versions to the state auditor’s office instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor questions in the report whether the office will make a “genuine effort to change” because of such an interference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because the Office of the President inappropriately inserted itself into the survey process, auditing standards prohibit us from drawing conclusions based on the survey results,” the report read. “As a result, the Office of the President missed an opportunity to receive feedback from its key stakeholders, and it demonstrated an unwillingness to receive constructive feedback.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A letter dated April 5 sent from UC President Janet Napolitano to State Auditor Elaine Howle addressed these claims. Napolitano said the report “fundamentally and unfairly mischaracterizes UCOP’s budget practices,” but she said UCOP welcomes the input and finds the recommendations “helpful.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the audit, UCOP Budget Director Eva Goode told the state auditor that UCOP can use the discretionary funds for any project within UCOP or any of the campuses. The state auditor said, however, that this contradicts a 2006 policy passed by the Regents prohibiting UCOP from spending any funding until the Regents approve a budget each year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor said UCOP believed disclosing these funds was unnecessary since Regents had approved the spending in previous years. However, the state auditor said there was no evidence provided to dispute the agency’s claims.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit also calls this into question because administrative expenses have increased by $80 million from 2012 to 2016, an increase of 28 percent in four years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit also states UCOP provided little information about the budget and that the information available is sometimes misleading, which the state auditor said makes it “difficult, if not impossible” for the Regents and state legislature to understand the budget and operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor’s office analyzed 10 executive positions and found they were paid a total of $3.7 million, over $700,000 more than the combined salaries of comparable state executives. The senior vice president for governmental relations was paid $130,000 more than the top three highest paid employees in similar state positions, the state auditor reported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the audit, UCOP uses salary survey data coming almost entirely from the private sector to determine salaries, but this is much higher than typical for state employees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor said UCOP defended the increased salaries by stating the higher education environment necessitates higher pay, but the state auditor’s office found this insufficient with regard to administrative staff like financial analysts who have similar tasks regardless of who they work for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state auditor also alleged employee benefits within the UC are significantly higher than standard, with UCOP spending at least $21.6 million from 2011 to 2016 on employee benefits. Such benefits are not typical within the public sector, the state auditor said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The office also spent over $2 million on business meetings and entertainment expenses over five years, according to the audit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the extent of the concerns identified, the state auditor’s office recommends significant reforms including reallocating savings to campuses, setting targets for reduced salaries and implementing practices for budgeting ensuring accountability and purposeful use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano’s letter addresses many areas of the draft which she believes misrepresent UCOP. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She first said the $175 million figure the audit quoted was actually $38 million of available and uncommitted reserve. She also said $175 million is an inaccurate figure, since $5 million of that amount is not UCOP-related “balance fund data.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano further broke down the $170 million figure, saying that $83 million of it is restricted and $87 million of it is unrestricted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $83 million of restricted funds support a “range of programs and initiatives,” Napolitano said. These include support for the UC Washington Center, UC health and lab research grant programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the $87 million of unrestricted funds, $49 million are already committed to various programs including but not limited to support for UC Merced, law students and the creation of a new medical school. This leaves $38 million in unrestricted funds, which accounts for about 10 percent of the budget, Napolitano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano said 10 percent of the budget is a reasonable amount to have in savings in case of unexpected expenses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also said the audit’s recommendations to reduce or eliminate systemwide or presidential initiatives would “impede the ability of some of our most vulnerable students to succeed, undermine research into critical issues and lessen UC’s public service impact.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano said the report “understates the extensive controls” she implemented when she joined UCOP in 2013. The vast majority of expenditures, she said, are reviewed and approved by her “personally.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano added that she has “concerns” that the audit does not take into consideration UCOP operating in 15 different activity areas, including “administration of systemwide retirement plans” while “none of the other 10 largest system offices … provide more than four functions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano’s six-page letter was released following statewide outcries. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The largest UC employee union, AFSCME, expressed outrage over UCOP’s misconduct and gratitude toward the auditor in a statement from Local 3299 President Kathryn Lybarger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lybarger said UCOP’s alleged interference in the auditing process reflects “a continuing pattern of deception” toward the state legislature, which she said UCOP has used to justify tuition hikes, high executive pay and “continued exploitation of low wage contractors.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our students, patients and colleagues deserve better,” Lybarger said in a statement Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Regent and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, in response, called for the reversal of tuition hikes that the Regents approved in November.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The audit must serve as a wakeup call for the Board of Regents, as a catalyst for serious soul-searching within the UC’s administration and demands a reboot of the relationship between the system and its governing body,” Newsom said in a statement on Tuesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is outrageous and unjust to force tuition hikes on students while the U.C. hides secret funds, and I call for the tuition decision to come back before the Board of Regents for reconsideration and reversal,” he added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

a company called California Clinical Trials, LLC or CCT, posted Facebook ads offering students covered under the UCs’ student health insurance plans a chance to earn money by participating in clinical trials.The company also went to various job fairs and offered students jobs in marketing in exchange for their health insurance information, UCOP said.</p>\n<p>UCOP said the students’ information was then used to write phony prescriptions, most of which were prescription pain-relief creams that are generally prescribed to treat arthritis in elderly patients. According to the press release, a majority of these are cheap, off-patent drugs that are instead billed to patients and insurers for thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p>The university is working on filing a temporary restraining order, UCOP said.</p>\n<p>“Our first priority is to our students,” said Dr. John Stob, executive vice president for UC Health, in the press release. “This needs to be immediately stopped. We have identified nine different health care providers who prescribed medications to these students, likely without any indication of physical exams or even a physician-patient relationship.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, the university is currently informing students whose information has been taken for nefarious purposes.</p>\n<p>“We are also concerned that the defendants appear to have convinced more than 500 students to part with sensitive personal information, which was then abused,” Robin Holmes-Sullivan, UC vice president for student affairs, said in the press release. “For this reason, in addition to pursuing the temporary restraining order, we are arranging identity protection services for all affected individuals.”</p>\n<p>UCOP said students should be careful and avoid taking “free samples” or cash in exchange for personal information.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Yuki Copnall / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He emphasized the importance of advocating for all students and making sure they know he will be there as a resource for them on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven Kwok, a member of the Elections Committee, posed a series of questions, some created by the committee and others asked anonymously by audience members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some highlights: </span></p>\n<p><b>ON THE OFFICE: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum said one of his “prime concerns” was creating more awareness of the Office of the Student Advocate General, since currently only about 20 students use the office per quarter. He plans to try to increase use of the office by encouraging resident assistants (RA) to give incoming freshmen information about the office’s resources. He said he plans to put an “extremely high” emphasis on promoting the office.</span></p>\n<p><b>PRESSING ISSUES: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum said he believes the election of President Donald Trump has made many students, particularly undocumented students, feel unsafe on campus. Another large issue is bringing controversial speakers to campus, and as Student Advocate General, Tannenbaum said he hopes to make sure students’ opinions are heard and that everyone feels safe. He also noted the rising costs of tuition and cliff erosion as big concerns for students. </span></p>\n<p><b>ON BEING IMPARTIAL: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Non-partisanship is extremely important,” Tannenbaum said. He said he takes his status as a non-partisan independent seriously, having sought the endorsement of both Campus Republicans and Democrats to show he is committed to representing all students, regardless of their views.</span></p>\n<p><b>ON INSTITUTIONAL RACISM:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tannenbaum said institutional racism is “one of the biggest issues in our country.” He said that as a white man, he has not experienced such racism but believes he can use his position to amplify the voices of those who do not feel heard on campus. Tannenbaum said he will try to make as many spaces safe on campus as possible and will do his best to make sure people’s voices are heard. </span></p>\n<p><b>ON PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I don’t sleep enough,” Tannenbaum said. “I push myself to work very hard and that often goes late into the night.” He said self care will be very important for him to do his best as Student Advocate General. </span></p>\n<p><b>ON EMOTIONAL LABOR: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum said he had not heard the term “emotional labor” in an “official context” but believes it is the “effort and emotion put into one’s work.” He said A.S. sometimes ignores the effort and time students put into the issues they are invested in on campus. He said, if elected, he will strive to work to make sure A.S. understands how much students care about critical issues on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum also fielded more lighthearted questions, revealing that his favorite board game is Diplomacy, a game that requires negotiation among players. He said he hopes to take the passion he has for the game to be as passionate about his work as Student Advocate General.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum closed the forum by reiterating that he wants students to feel “heard, safe and represented,” something he feels is oftentimes overlooked within the community and student government. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tannenbaum, describing himself as “a pretty loud guy,” said he will do his best to make sure everyone is heard and that there are resources available for students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Please know that I care about the students on this campus, and I really strive to make this a home for everybody,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S. elections began on Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Tamari Dzotsenidze/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>This growth has been a long time coming. He and his former business partner first approached their lawyer on Dec. 1, 2015; they launched over a month later on Jan. 28, 2016.</p>\n<p>Today, the Treehouse has between 850 and 1,000 customers.</p>\n<p>In the early days, he campaigned on foot with his friends by handing out flyers at fraternities, stapling them to telephone poles and handing out business cards as early as 8 a.m.</p>\n<p>These sacrifices haven’t ceased now that the business has grown. Barrett said his biggest challenge is the loss of his social life and youth. He cites stories of walking out during midterms because he had to answer business calls and driving all night with his friends to pick up product from San Francisco and be back before 10 a.m.</p>\n<p>“People think because I’m in this business I must smoke all the time, but I’ve never smoked less,” he said.</p>\n<p>Barrett now employs a UCSB senior, a recent graduate and two seasonal out-of-town workers. His former partner bowed out of the business due to parental backlash. However, the two remain on good terms.</p>\n<p>“I do cater to a lot of out-of-town patients, but the bread-and-butter daily routine is mostly from UCSB students,” he said.</p>\n<p>Barrett operates his company based on the “three Ps”: product, price and promptness. The Treehouse currently has the most five-star ratings in I.V. on Weedmaps, a source of pride for Barrett. He said all of the medicine sold is organic and that he goes out of his way to maintain the best quality.</p>\n<p>This attention to quality sometimes has financial consequences; one time he dropped a significant amount of product, which he then couldn’t sell. Product that dries before it can sell is taken off and slated for personal use rather than being sold to ensure that customers receive quality medicine.</p>\n<p>It is for this reason that he doesn’t like the direction recreational marijuana use is going. While he isn’t against the principle, he believes it needs to be better regulated and that sellers need to consider what customers are putting into their bodies.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue facing the business is banking, Barrett said. Because marijuana is still a federally regulated substance, banks do not accept money made off marijuana. Barrett described this as an “annoyance,” citing safety concerns for himself and his staff, difficulties of being a cash-only business and backlash from customers who wish to use credit cards to pay.</p>\n<p>“Stop thinking that we’re drug dealers,” he said. “I work a lot of hours, over 100 a week easily, over 120 … I’m earning it.”</p>\n<p>With regulations constantly changing and Barrett shifting his focus more toward cultivation, the future of the I.V. Treehouse Collective is uncertain.</p>\n<p>“I get asked all the time, ‘Would you sell it, would you sell it?’ and the answer is I don’t want to. It’s like asking if you would sell your child,” he said. “But the way the laws are written they technically say delivery services will be banned.”</p>\n<p>Despite these setbacks, he maintains hope for the future of the Treehouse. Cities like San Jose have started to issue registrations to allow dispensaries to deliver medical marijuana, giving hope that deliveries may not be completely banned.</p>\n<p>Barrett said he has also considered creating a physical storefront, but he was deterred by the amount of capital necessary.</p>\n<p>All profits he is making are going back into the business, particularly his farm. Though he lives comfortably, his lifestyle isn’t extravagant, and he pays his employees well.</p>\n<p>For Barrett personally, once he graduates he plans to leave Santa Barbara behind.</p>\n<p>“Monetarily, it makes a little bit more sense to be going up north,” he said. He plans to increase the cultivation side of the business and eventually use the proceeds to retire by 34 and move into other types of agriculture.</p>\n<p>“I love agriculture. I’ve always wanted to do crops, [but] it’s just expensive and marijuana’s a cash crop,” he said. “It got me into the industry I have always been dreaming of being in … I don’t have the money to buy 50 acres of almonds and start there.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2029.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/tamari-dzotsenidze/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Tamari Dzotsenidze</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Tamari Dzotsenidze, Managing Editor, first started at the Daily Nexus her first quarter freshman year as an assistant news editor.
