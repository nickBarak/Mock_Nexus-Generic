This marks the third consecutive year that the Gauchos have sent at least 11 or more athletes to the NCAA West Regionals.</p>\n<p>The NCAA first round is a preliminary competition held at two sites, one in the west in Austin, Texas, and one in the east in Jacksonville, Fla. Both events are held on the same day simultaneously, with the top 48 athletes in open events and the top 24 relay teams from each region competing for a top-12 finish to move on to the Finals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will be represented by six female athletes and five male athletes who each will be competing in single events. They will be led by the efforts of seniors Maxine Goyette, in the 3000m steeple, and Matthew Kuskey, throwing the javelin, both of whom are making their second consecutive Western Regional appearances.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Goyette finished with her best time ever in the 3000m steeplechase with a mark of 10:28.43 while taking silver during the Big West Championships last week, which thereby moved her to third all-time at UCSB in that event.

In just her sophomore season, she has moved into second all-time at UCSB in both of those events, and now she will be looking to build upon her early success in her first Western Regional appearance. She will be joined by senior Shannon Trumbull, as they both will represent UCSB in the women’s 400m hurdles.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting athlete to keep an eye on would be junior Jenna Hinkle, who has consistently improved her finishing times throughout her career and is also coming off an astounding 2016 cross country season, during which she established herself as a national contender after finishing fifth in the Stanford Invitational with a time of 20:31.1.</p>\n<p>She will be competing in the women’s 1500m after taking home gold for the second year in a row at the Big West Championships last week. Her PR of 4:16.67 last year is currently ranked No. 26 in the NCAA.</p>\n<p>Senior Tori Usgaard has done it all for the Gauchos since joining the program four years ago. Her versatility includes competing in the heptathlon, long jump, high jump, 4 x 400m and 100m hurdles, which are just some of the ways she has contributed to UCSB’s success in recent years. She will compete in the long jump when traveling to Austin this week after finishing with a mark of 19-04.25 at the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>Concluding the women participants is senior Valerie Nestor, who, like Goyette, is peaking at the right time, considering she marked a personal best at the Big West Regionals with a 195-08 hammer throw. This will be her first time being invited to the Western Regionals in the hammer throw, and she has consistently made tremendous strides in her craft year after year to get to this point.</p>\n<p>Senior Adam Avila will be the sole male Gaucho competing in a running event. After claiming Big West Silver in the 3,000m steeplechase as a sophomore, Avila earned gold while in Fullerton with a time of 9:00.43, helping the Gauchos take the top-two conference spots in the event. Using back-to-back sub-nine minute efforts in the event over the course of seven days, Avila qualified for the NCAA First Round with a personal best time of 8:59.40.</p>\n<p>The remaining men’s track athletes will represent UCSB in throwing events, including senior Matthew Kuskey, senior Stephen Leach, junior Chris Ross and junior Kordell Hampton. In just his second season throwing the javelin, Kuskey qualified for the NCAA First Round in the event. He took home gold at the Big West Championships last week in the javelin with a throw of 218-08. He aims to return to the NCAA postseason and crack the UCSB All-Time list in the event. Ross will join him in the javelin at the Western Regionals after finishing second to Kuskey at the Big West Championships with a PR mark of 202-02.</p>\n<p>Hampton, UCSB school record-holder in the discus, came within an inch of his best mark to grab Big West silver. The junior, on his second to the last throw, found his place on the podium and notched his second-best career mark at 181-01. This will be his first appearance in the Western Regionals.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Leach will compete in the shot put after coming within a foot of his PR to score points in one of the deepest Big West shot put fields ever. Finishing eighth at the Big West Championships with a mark of 52-10.25, Leach looks to improve upon his achievements and be a formidable contender in the Western Regionals.</p>\n<p>Competition begins Thursday, May 25, with the 400m dash and concludes Saturday, May 27, with the 4x400m relay. As mentioned, the top-12 contenders will advance to the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championship set to take place from June 7-10 in Eugene, Ore.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

hosted and dropped two out of three games this last weekend to an impressive San Diego State Aztecs team,UCSB junior second baseman Colton Burns believes he understands what has motivated the Aztecs to turn it around this year.</p>\n<p>A former high school and junior college teammate of Burns, junior SDSU outfielder Chad Bible was set to start his first full Division I collegiate season, but on January 10, 2017, just before the season got under way, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>\n<p>“We had this weekend circled on our calendars to play against each other for the first time,” Burns said. “You would never wish the timing of something like that to happen to anybody, but it fires me up to see that the guys over there have rallied around him so well this season.”</p><!--Ad

the junior college level. But even during that impressive season, he says, he could tell something was wrong.</p>\n<p>“I woke up one day last May and had this lump in my neck,” Bible said. “The doctor said it was normal for kids my age to get inflammation there sometimes, so because of that and the way I was playing, I just never thought anything of it.”</p>\n<p>However, more lumps would appear throughout the summer as he geared up to transfer from College of the Canyons to SDSU for the fall semester. Bible even admits that his girlfriend grew annoyed with him during the summer because all he wanted to do was sleep after games.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad, Mike, also stated that he always had concerns, adding, “It just never felt right to me from the beginning, and it wasn’t until the third or fourth check-up where they said, ‘I think it’s a waste of your time to get another scan’ that I started to believe it was nothing to worry about.”</p>\n<p>Luckily, Bible told a trainer at SDSU, who referred him to the team doctor. Other tests were done, leading to the biopsy in December of 2016.</p>\n<p>Then came the news that he had cancer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77364\" style=\"width: 290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77364\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77364\" data-attachment-id=\"77364\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/san-diego-state-athlete-headshots/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"San Diego State Athlete Headshots\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-77364\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug-683x1024.jpg?resize=280%2C420\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible-Chad-mug.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77364\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>“I didn’t really hear anything after the doctor said ‘cancer,’” Bible said. “But after they went into detail that I would have to drop out of school, quit playing baseball and move home for treatment, all I asked was that we started treatment the day after playing Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>After getting the reluctant “okay” from the doctor, Bible said, “That was so huge for me to be able to do that and to not see all this work I’ve put in over the years go to waste.”</p>\n<p>Getting a chance to play Fullerton was another contest circled on Bible’s calendar from a long time ago because it was the university that he attended out of high school. He redshirted his freshman year there, then transferred to College of the Canyons, before finally landing himself at SDSU.</p>\n<p>When looking back on it, Bible uses humor to downplay the situation.</p>\n<p>“I got along great with those guys at Fullerton, and I’ve never been a cancer in the clubhouse,” he joked. “But for whatever reason, the coach and I there just never saw eye to eye.”</p>\n<p>Through the first five games of the season, Bible batted clean-up for the Aztecs, eager to prove to himself and his former Fullerton coach that he could play at the Division 1 level.</p>\n<p>On February 22, 2017, Bible went 2-for-4 in a Wednesday night matchup versus the Fullerton Titans, which would improve and conclude his batting average at .318 for the season, as he would begin treatment the next morning.</p>\n<p>With each ensuing inning, things grew more emotional at Fullerton, though few in attendance knew it. Each time Bible stepped up to the plate, his family could be seen taking pictures of each at-bat behind the SDSU dugout, wiping away tears in the process.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs went on to earn a 5-4 victory that night following a save by SDSU closer CJ Saylor, who gave the game ball to Bible.</p>\n<p>Knowing he would be making his way to start his first round of chemotherapy at the City of Hope in Los Angeles just five hours later, Bible received a hug from each of the Fullerton players in line for handshakes. Some he knew and many he did not, but all were deeply moved by his story.</p>\n<p>Bible’s dad recalls the moment as the most emotional one of his life.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t about the logo on your hat or the colors on your uniform that night,” he said. “It was just a bunch of dudes showing love and respect for something bigger than baseball.”</p>\n<p>Bible stated that the prognosis for him is great, adding that the survival rate is 90 to 95 percent. He has already gone through three rounds of treatment with five more scheduled every other week through the month of June.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77365\" style=\"width: 446px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-77365\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77365\" data-attachment-id=\"77365\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/bible500/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bible500\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-77365\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500-1024x683.jpg?resize=436%2C290\" alt=\"\" width=\"436\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bible500.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77365\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SDSU Athletics</p></div>\n<p>He says that he has developed hope from athletes who have walked in his shoes before, such as current Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and pitcher Jon Lester. Both players were diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma during their careers and made full recoveries after their treatment. In fact, Lester was so moved by Bible’s story that he reached out via text during his treatment.</p>\n<p>“I just want to be an inspiration like those guys,” Bible said. “I mean, people can feel bad, and that’s all fine and dandy. But what I really want is for people to see me smiling, fighting cancer or playing baseball and ask themselves, like, ‘Wow, what’s my excuse?’”</p>\n<p>Before the Aztecs began accumulating a 29-12 record this season, a major turnaround from last year’s disappointing 21-win season, SDSU pitcher Dominic Purpura came up with a way to pay tribute to Bible throughout the season in a form inspired by their offseason Navy S.E.A.L. training in Coronado.</p>\n<p>Purpura had dog tags made for both the players and coaches, who each received two tags. One tag is personalized with the person’s name, while the other tag reads as follows:</p>\n<p>“San Diego State Baseball 2017”</p>\n<p>“Family Forever”</p>\n<p>“TG19 DTR,” in honor of the former head coach Tony Gwynn, who passed away, and his slogan “Do things right.”</p>\n<p>And below is a nod to Bible, with his initials and number.</p>\n<p>“Fearless CMB23”</p>\n<p>“To be honest, I just started crying,” Bible said. “It meant so much to know that this fight that I am going through is not all for waste, and I couldn’t thank Dom enough for that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 20, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/behind-the-seams-sdsus-chad-bible-wont-allow-cancer-to-strikeout-his-dreams/","id":1884,"author":{"id":313,"name":"Austin Cole"},"related":[1883,1882,1881],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/313"}},"__N_SSG":true}
