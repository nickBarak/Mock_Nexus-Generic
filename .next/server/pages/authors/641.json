Happn</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happn is an app that gives you matches based on where you go throughout the day. Say you go to Buchanan Hall and pass someone on the way who is also on happn; now they show up in your feed and you have the option to like them. If you match, you start up a conversation. The problem with happn is the lack of users. Most people at UCSB don’t seem to know that happn exists, which doesn’t really make it a useful dating app. In the two or three months I used it, I got a solid four new people in my feed every two weeks. And out of those, only half of them were students from UCSB. The other issue I had with happn was that I found it a little creepy. If you click on somebody, you can see exactly where you crossed paths and how many times. If somebody wanted to stalk me purely from when and where I ran into them on the app, they had a perfect way to do so. Overall, as an app for dating at UCSB, it wasn’t the greatest, because of the lack of UCSB students. As for whether or not it was good for short/long term dating, I really can’t say, just because of the lack of people to test my theories on. </span></p>\n<p><strong>5.

Hinge is made for people looking for more serious connections, so I was hopeful. Unfortunately, most people in the UCSB area, and most people under 22 in general, don’t seem to know about this app, which is kind of a problem, especially if UCSB students under 22 make up your dating pool. Other than that, the app was nicely designed. I appreciated going through one profile at a time. Everybody answered whether or not they drank, smoked (cigarettes and weed), their location, and their schooling. I have a no smokers rule, so with that addition to the profile, it was much easier to filter. But if we’re asking whether or not it’s a good app to find a relationship at UCSB, then it experiences the same problem as happn. There are just not enough people for it to be a viable option.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody says that you’ll find your match when you least expect it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>4. Coffee Meets Bagel</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coffee Meets Bagel is an app that gives you a “bagel” every week, a certain profile of somebody they have picked out for you, somebody they think that you could match with. Again, there weren’t many UCSB students on this app either, but it still had more than Hinge and happn did, which is what puts is further up on the list. The idea of the weekly bagel was cute— while it lasted, anyway. My biggest problem with Coffee Meets Bagel was that, after a certain amount of time in the Santa Barbara area, the app ran out of “bagels” to offer. Aside from students at UCSB, there weren’t even enough other people to fill the “bagel” gap after three or four rejections. At least the app had a discover section where you could potentially create your own matches without the app playing matchmaker. But even with that, the UCSB offerings were slim to none, and I found myself being liked by 34 year olds. Which was kind of creepy. And disgusting. As a whole, the app had a nice concept, but poor follow through and not enough UCSB students to get it higher up on this list. </span></p>\n<p><strong>3. Bumble </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bumble is an app that allows women to message first in order to avoid any inappropriate advances from guys. It’s a very feminist forward idea, but I’ve always wondered what prevents said guys from sending creepy messages after you’ve messaged them first. I do like that it forces you to message each other fairly quickly (the match disappears after twenty four hours unless you make a move) which gets rid of the “I need to wait a week before I message him” Tinder bullshit. I did find myself wishing for more than one day, though. I am a forgetful person. Added to the fact that I don’t always see notifications, I miss some matches entirely. And since the guys have to respond back to me within twenty four hours, I’m sure they experience similar problems. The interface is also quite buggy. It doesn’t always notify you when you have a message, nor does it always load the message when you get the notification. One of the great things about Bumble, though, is the amount of people. Bumble is a fairly well-known app, so UCSB students are not hard to find. And, while it’s not specifically geared toward relationships, because there are so many people, there is a higher likelihood of finding somebody who is looking for the same things you are.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’ve waited long enough, when you just want to feel like you’re doing something to try and find your match, online dating is a good outlet. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. OkCupid </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OkCupid is an app that is definitely for people interested in more serious connections. The app is really well done in that, in addition to photos, each person answers a plethora of questions about themselves and has what they’re looking for on the bottom of their profile: hookups, friends, long term dating. This makes it easier to filter out people who aren’t looking for what you want. One of the frustrating things about this app, though, is that once you have rejected enough people, they start to filter back into your discover feed even though you have already rejected them. It’s like OkCupid is trying to tell you something:”Remember these people you were too good for earlier? Yeah, well, now they’re your only option.” The other extremely annoying feature of the app is that they do not send you notifications when you get a message, they send you emails. So every damn time you get a message, you get an email, which is not great for inbox clutter. It also caused me to miss some messages because I didn’t know I’d gotten them for a long time. There weren’t as many UCSB students as I would’ve wanted, but because there were more students than Hinge, happn, and Coffee Meets Bagel put together, and it was substantially more geared toward relationships, I felt it deserved the number two spot. </span></p>\n<p><strong>1. Tinder </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody knows what Tinder is. Swipe right if you like them, swipe left if you don’t. And if you both like each other, you start up a conversation. Tinder is established. It’s almost never buggy and it’s one of the simplest, easiest apps to navigate and use. Its popularity means that it is, in fact, extremely populated. UCSB students use Tinder.  I’ll be the first to say that I didn’t want Tinder to take the number one spot on this list. It’s definitely not an app that is made for people who are looking for relationships. A lot of the people you message with are just looking to get laid. Despite this drawback (for me, it’s a drawback), there’s one thing about Tinder that none of the other apps can beat: the sheer number of people. Not all of them are looking for relationships, but not all of them are solely interested in hooking up either. Tinder is the only app that can boast this wide a variety of people, which is why, despite the fact that there are better, more relationship geared apps out there, Tinder earns the number one spot on this list. It’s the most versatile app because, if you reject somebody, there will always be somebody else. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I’m being honest, at the end of the day, I don’t really like online dating. It feels impersonal and detached. There is so much about a person that you cannot hope to understand over a phone screen. You don’t know if there would be chemistry, or if you could replicate conversations over text in person. And no app is going to save you when you’re face to face with that person. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But online dating is a good way to be looking. Everybody says that you’ll find your match when you least expect it. It won’t be when you go looking for them. But, when you’ve waited long enough, when you just want to feel like you’re doing something to try and find your match, online dating is a good outlet. It’s a good way to make connections, relationships and test out your moves. It might be impersonal, but that’s also helpful in that you can embarrass yourself without ever meeting that person in real life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships in college, especially at UCSB, can be hard to find. And despite what people say about how you only meet your match when you stop looking, I don’t think I understand how you can expect to find your match if you don’t. So you’re going to match with the wrong people and have bad conversations and go on awful dates, because if you don’t, you’ll never get to the good stuff. Not everybody is looking for what you are, but part of the process is finding out who is.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <em>Komal Surani hopes that her guide can help Gauchos find love right on their mobile device. </em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-07/best-dating-apps-for-people-at-ucsb-who-are-interested-in-being-in-a-relationship/","id":6290,"author":{"id":641,"name":"Komal Surani"},"related":[6289,6288,6287],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rules of Sex and Marriage","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2017-05-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sexreligionlife-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sexreligionlife-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Komal Surani questions the way we come to understand and follow the rules of sex and marriage.

As I grew older, things didn’t change. My parents, my religion — my family is among the least Muslim of all Muslims, but they still believe that sex is to be had after marriage — and my community treated sex and sexual pleasure as an ugly facet of a person, something that was evil and wrong. </p>\n<p>Every time I thought about sex or felt sexual pleasure, I told myself I was wrong and impure and would go to hell because my body was feeling something it shouldn’t be. It was enjoying something dirty. I was dirty. For the longest time I felt that my body and I did not deserve respect or care because people who gave in to disgusting temptations didn’t deserve good things. Over time and through a series of experiences, however, I came to believe that sexuality was not a bad thing to have.</p>\n<p>As a young, impressionable thirteen-year-old, I learned about sex. My parents gave me the sex talk. It went something like, “Sex is used by adults when they’re married to make children.” That was it. That was my sex talk. It was understood that this was not advice or optional. This was the rule. “Sex is used by adults when they’re married to make children.” My mother did not say anything about sexual pleasure. Sex is for procreation, not pleasure. Around that same time, my family got an iPad. I was often allowed to use/borrow it, so I used the internet occasionally to satisfy my sexual curiosity because I knew my parents wouldn’t approve of or answer some of the thoughts and feelings I was having about sex. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I found websites that I really shouldn’t have been looking at as a young middle-schooler. When my parents found out, they screamed at me. I remember they told me I was disgusting. What I wanted to know and what I felt about sex was wrong. They were disappointed in me. That night changed the way I felt about sex for years. To have people tell you, from the moment you become curious about sex, that interest, that desire is immoral and wicked leaves a lasting impression. </p>\n<p>I spent years believing my body was betraying me by feeling things I wasn’t supposed to. I imagined my sexuality as an evil force in my body, placed there by God to test whether or not I could resist temptation. Whenever I couldn’t, I reiterated what my parents had told me to myself: I was disgusting. I was dirty. I should be ashamed of myself and my body. </p>\n<p>I now believe my parents’ lecture should have been about internet safety, not sexual curiosity, they grew up in a different time. They grew up in Pakistan, in a religion and in an environment in which they were taught that sex was to reproduce and nothing more. Their parents instilled in them a set of very traditional, very rigid beliefs about their bodies that they very much came to live and breathe. </p>\n<p>My environment, however, was in America. In America, sex-ed is about safety, not about waiting until marriage. The people around me and the culture naturally influenced the way I felt about sex and eventually the way I would come to feel. My parents, not understanding that, attempted to regain control of me by talking about my body the way their parents had spoken about theirs. I cannot blame them for reacting in such a way, because that must have been how their own parents reacted when it came to sex. Sex is not wrong. It’s normal. And as a young teenager, it was something I should have been allowed to think about it, but my culture shamed me for wondering about sexual pleasure. </p>\n<blockquote><p>To have people tell you, from the moment you become curious about sex, that interest, that desire is immoral and wicked leaves a lasting impression.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then, I began touring colleges my sophomore year, and I remember being in a hotel room with another Shia Imami Ismaili Nizari Muslim. We talked about the most taboo of subjects: sex. She was older than me and wondered on the most superficial of levels if she got married without sleeping with him, how would she know if he was good in bed? It was a small thing, but it started my “rebellious” thinking about sex. The summer before junior year, I went to a Muslim summer camp that taught confidence and self-acceptance. I became much more confident that year, and in the process I thought much more about whether or not my parents were right about sex. The summer before my senior year, I did some research, and I told myself that sex was not a bad thing. </p>\n<p>When school started, I talked to one of my counselors about it, and she reconfirmed what I very tentatively felt: Sex was normal. Thinking about sex was normal. I told myself this again and again, and I experienced sexual pleasure and orgasms without feeling guilty like I had in the past. As a result, I became a much more honest and open person and most definitely a much happier person because I knew I wasn’t disgusting or a freak or any other derogatory term my community assigned to people who thought sex could involve pleasure. </p>\n<p>I still wasn’t sure if I wanted to have sex before marriage, but one person told me something that tipped me over to the other side. She told me about a friend who had sexual experiences before she met the man she would marry. After marriage, she felt regret because she hadn’t waited to have sex with “the one.” Her advice to me was that if I was going to regret my experiences after marriage, then I should wait. As a person staunchly against regret, however, I believe a person’s experiences lead them to wherever — or whomever — they end up in life. </p>\n<p>Regretting who came before marriage might mean I never met my match. I also want to live life and experience all the experiences it has to offer me. I’m no longer against sex, before marriage, after marriage, whatever. As long as you take care of yourself and your body and treat yourself and your partner with respect, it shouldn’t matter when you have sex. If your partner doesn’t feel that way, then they might not be the one for you. The right person will respect you no matter what.</p>\n<p>My experience with sex and myself hasn’t always been easy. People, especially my family, have made it difficult. But that doesn’t mean that how I feel isn’t worth going forward with. I might have to fight every step of the way to say, “Yes, I am going on a date,” “Yes, I will be kissed,” “Yes, one day I will have sex,” “Yes, I will get birth control.” </p>\n<p>I have fought for all of these things, but that just makes them so much more important to me. These are my experiences — not my mother’s — that we’re talking about here. If you believe something in your life or a feel a certain way about something other people in your life don’t, that’s okay, as long as you don’t let their feelings get in the way of yours. I tell my mom all the time, “I respect your beliefs, you respect mine.”</p>\n<p><em>Komal Surani wants you to live your sexual life based on your own beliefs. </em><br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78232\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78232\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-31/rules-of-sex-and-marriage/","id":6291,"author":{"id":641,"name":"Komal Surani"},"related":[6290,6289,6288],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/641"}},"__N_SSG":true}
