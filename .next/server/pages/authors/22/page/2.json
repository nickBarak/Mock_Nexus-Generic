While the statement offered no further clarifications, UCDC promised to work with college campuses, many of which have already switched to remote instruction, to address any possible concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aryana Kamelian, a UCSB fourth-year psychological and brain sciences and political science double major who attended UCDC during winter quarter, explained that while the cancellation will minimally affect her, its impact on semester system students — such as those attending UC Berkeley or UC Merced — carries greater concern.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of my friends who are on the semester system are struggling to find housing and plan their trips home since their program is ending early,” Kamelian said. However, she emphasized that many students in the winter quarter program have been expecting they would have to leave long before UCDC canceled it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been interning in a congressional office this quarter, and since the outbreak started, we were all pretty certain it would only be a matter of time until it reached the Hill,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California Center Sacramento (UCCS), which offers students a similar opportunity to gain work and internship experience in a state government, does not plan to cancel its spring term but will be modifying parts of the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, academic coursework, professional development workshops, and public engagement programs will be conducted using distance education technology,” said Cindy Simmons, UCCS associate director. “Internship placements will not be affected unless there are changes in recommendations from public health authorities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kamelian, who has returned to California, expressed the emotional toll of having to depart the program with little warning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that’s been one of the hardest things about this — there hasn’t been any time to transition or take things in,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><em>[Updated: 5/14/20 1:26 p.m]</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction [9:40 p.m.]: This article has been updated to clarify that <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kamelian is a fourth-year UCSB student. </span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

However, personnel managers were adamant that students follow dining hall protocol and not remove food from Ortega, leading to a brief confrontation with activists and students leaving with to-go plates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as lines for food got longer and began to stretch around the building, organizers continued to encourage students to take food to go. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to occupy Ortega was made to show how the UC “functions as a business rather than a school,” according to the COLA press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By liberating this dining commons, we draw attention to how food insecurity functions daily on our campus, keeping us from being the students, teachers, and mentors we want to be.

One student, Kayla Katsuda, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, noted that she came for the free lunch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my friends told me about what was going on, and I came because I don’t have a meal plan,” Katsuda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One UCSB student and Ortega Dining Commons employee explained to the Nexus that he “didn’t know what was going on” at first. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They seemed to be letting all people in, and the food is overpriced, so I would agree with that.

Recreation &amp; Park District building, and was a guest speaker at various UC Santa Barbara classes — was remembered as “the type of person to respect all people, regardless of who they were,” said Marcelino Sepulveda, a friend of Bean’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He touched many generations of people, and that is represented here today. Today is an opportunity for the greater community to honor Michael for who he was and what he gave us,” Sepulveda said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees spoke of Bean’s talent for bringing together generations; UCSB students and permanent Isla Vista residents alike touted his dedication to the community around him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael had an uncanny ability to see past age and see the person instead, which made people of all ages enjoy his company and want to spend more time with him,” one tearful community member explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bean’s commitment to the environment was “unparalleled,” they added. Bean often biked through the streets of I.V. collecting trash and was a strong proponent for a community forest to feed food-insecure community members, the community member said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bean was also an active member of the spiritual group Diamond Heart, as several mentioned at the memorial. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our group sessions, we would share personal information that was often very difficult to say. Michael would always be there with a kind word, to listen and in turn share his personal stories,” according to one speaker. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to members of Bean’s various community groups, UCSB students also found inspiration in Bean’s dedication to an environmental community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We would often read together,” Ash Vincent, a UCSB environmental studies and feminist studies major, said. “He was always interested in what me or any other people were reading, and I thought sharing that shows how he was always interested and always learning new ways he could be useful to the community. I think he was underappreciated.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many, including Vincent, left memorial attendees with concrete ways to honor Bean’s legacy. In addition to a petition to dedicate the Free Box to Bean, Vincent encouraged attendees to email him for a copy of an Ecovista source book that Bean wrote before his death.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One UCSB student — Bean’s neighbor and an environmental studies major, who remained unnamed — acknowledged his uncommon relationship with Bean, who he met in UCSB Professor John Foran’s sociology class Earth in Crisis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael had a very special connection to this place, and I got to see him try and better himself and our community… seeing him biking around and coming home to him feeding the scrub jays in our yard was a really special moment for me, and I’ve been doing my best to feed them for him,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sepulveda, who helped organize the celebration of life, asked attendees to take wildflower seeds and spread them around I.V. following the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We invite you to take these and disperse them, so that his spirit may grow and blossom amongst the flowers here,” Sepulveda said. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 5, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Chinese officials put the latest death toll at 563, and the number of confirmed cases at 28,018; there have been 12 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. as of Feb. 5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. has put in place screening and quarantine measures for those traveling from possibly infected areas, according to the New York Times. The UC system is following a nationwide protocol in screening patients who have symptoms of the virus and have been outside the country in the last 14 days, the New York Times said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht was quick to reassure teach-in attendees that “the risk to our campus community is pretty low.” The virus has an incubation period of roughly 5-14 days, and “for most people on campus, those who have travelled to or possibly been near an infected person are well out of the incubation period, meaning they did not get infected,” he elaborated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should someone from UCSB be diagnosed with the virus, the school would defer to Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and is still “remaining diligent” in helping students stay safe, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith went on to detail prevention methods for the coronavirus, which are the same as those recommended for the flu or common cold. “Do the things you should be doing all day every day anyways,” Smith recommended to students while passing around hand sanitizers to the audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hand sanitizer, a full squirt, even your thumbs … always wash your hands, [and] if you’re sick, limit contact with others. Eat well, get rest,” she reminded the audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is not necessary for those who have not been infected to wear masks,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pan Asian Network statement also detailed the ridicule that some students have received while wearing masks to help them feel more protected on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students feel the need to laugh and point at us for wearing N95 masks that are scientifically proven to help prevent the spread of disease,” the statement said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katie, a community member who declined to state her last name and who described herself as “deeply involved with Chinese students on campus,” discussed the cultural divide between China and the U.S. during the Q&amp;A portion of the event and the confusion that international students might feel.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If everything they’re hearing back home is that roads are blocked off, everyone is wearing masks, people are being asked to not ride mass transit — everything they’re hearing from the community they trust is that this is a huge deal. And then they come here, and the qualified medical professionals are just telling them, basically, to wash their hands,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comments and questions addressed to the three faculty and staff members made it clear that many students were still feeling anxiety and concern not only around the coronavirus but also around the underlying racist sentiments that have penetrated most discussions around it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This isn’t just affecting a subgroup of people who have the virus, but the entire Asian community on campus,” Vince Matthew Feliciano, a Pan Asian board member, explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To people who might already feel like they don’t belong, this is just emphasizing the divide between who is Asian and who isn’t.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

</span><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speakers, including UCSB students and community organizers, gave speeches on their personal experiences with racism, institutionalized oppression in higher education and the importance of allyship. The procession of approximately 100 then walked to North Hall, stopping at the mural that honors the students who protested there for Black rights in 1968, before ending at the MultiCultural Center (MCC) for lunch.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was hosted by the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee of Santa Barbara, UCSB’s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the MCC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chris Hudley, vice president of the Martin Luther King Jr. Committee, elaborated on the importance of the theme “Remembering The Silence of Our Friends,” which comes from the famous King quote: “We remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During political years, we have forgotten to have conversations,” Hudley explained. “We want the idea of people having conversations, learning and collaborating, to build inclusiveness and equality.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inclusion of friends in conversation was emphasized throughout the event; participants were asked to talk to strangers during the walk about the change they wish to see in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Frick-Jenkins, president of UCSB’s Black Student Union, discussed the Eternal Flame monument, where the walk begins. The Flame was donated as a gift by the UCSB Class of 1968 to commemorate peace and unity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the Eternal Flame … commemorates the ongoing legacy of MLK because he lit a similar flame under Black students to take under North Hall and demand equality. I find it important for Black students and those who understand their struggle to not only see the monument as one to MLK’s legacy but also one about taking up space in this institution,” Frick-Jenkins said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frick-Jenkins’ ideas of “self determination, Black freedom and liberation,” which were recurring themes throughout the event, led to a discussion of empowerment in institutions of higher education like UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Take up space here,” Frick-Jenkins told attendees. “We can see ourselves within this institution that was not inherently made for the education of Black people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deandre Miles-Hercules, president of the Black Graduate Students Association, touched on their personal experiences as a Black, gender nonconforming individual and, similarly to Frick-Jenkins, their struggle with taking up space in academia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is important for me personally, because I am Black and gender nonconforming and as a scholar that is not often a comfortable place to be, and in the world that it is often dangerous and harmful to be in,” Miles-Hercules said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“MLK said direct action is presenting our very bodies to the conscience of the public of our national and local communities,” they explained. “My presence and showing up authentically is direct action. That too is walking in Dr. King’s legacy.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While talking to the crowd, Miles-Hercules also emphasized how their presence at UCSB is statistically unlikely. In the 2017-18 academic year, only 3% of graduate students were Black, whereas 5.8% of California residents were Black, a nearly 3% difference between state and university demographics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Regent Elect and UCSB graduate student Jamaal Muwwakkil, another speaker, reiterated this point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not supposed to be here. I’m a poor kid from Compton, California. The statistics are against me … I was not supposed to gain access to the UC. The paradigm for Black students is that diversity lowers standards, that the more Black students you have, the lower the ranking of your school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anne H. Charity-Hudley, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Hall Endowed Chair in the Linguistics of African America</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and linguistics professor, encouraged attendees to discuss with others what made them come out to the event on their walk to North Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miriam Bankons, a participant who has been coming to the event for five years, was eager to share her answer to Charity-Hudley’s question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m here in memory of all the people that came before me and walking for them,” she said. “Talking to other people that we don’t know, that we don’t see, is a way to honor King. His holiday is about a day of service, and I believe this is a way of service.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the march reached North Hall, Charity-Hudley recounted the racism she has experienced while achieving success in academia, including being targeted by police and having drawings of lynchings painted on her wall after receiving a raise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In many positions, people are happy to see Black people on campus until they receive raises, labs and support. There’s a level of tension when we don’t stay in our place … I want you to think about how we can continue to rise until you make somebody else nervous with your level of success.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participants then walked to the MCC to enjoy lunch, celebrate successes made in the name of Black empowerment and listen to MLK’s most famous speeches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many attendees discussed how Miles-Hercules’s words resonated with them, especially their ending comments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Be a brother, a sister, be a partner in crime to equity and justice, and show up when things are hard and let go of some of that privilege that you might bear in the service of equity and justice,” Miles-Hercules said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That is how we walk in Dr. King’s footsteps and honor his memory.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

legislature in June. </span><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2020-21/pdf/BudgetSummary/HigherEducation.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which allocates $36 billion for higher education across the state, offers a 5% increase in “base” resources for UC campuses, as well as funding for several specific programs on UC campuses, including the expansion of the UC Riverside School of Medicine, UC San Francisco School of Medicine and the UC San Diego Center for Public Preparedness Multi-Campus Research Initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important step toward covering the funds necessary to meet UC’s tripartite mission of delivering world-class education, conducting cutting-edge research and providing public service that benefits California and beyond,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Board of Regents Chair John Pérez and UC President Janet Napolitano said in a joint statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to ongoing funding, the budget aims to help students who require immigration legal services to defend themselves in court, support degree and certificate completion programs at UC extension centers and develop a UC Subject Matter Project in computer science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement by UC Student Association (UCSA) President Varsha Sarveshwar, who “welcomed” the proposed budget, she expressed hope that UCSA could work with legislators “to secure additional investments that reflect UC student priorities: investments in outreach and retention programs, mental health services, and resources for undocumented students, foster youth, and formerly incarcerated students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the budget proposal stated that “these investments are provided with the expectation that UC will continue to focus on maintaining college affordability, increasing student access, improving timely degree completion, and reducing achievement gaps,” it made no explicit mention of the services Sarveshwar detailed in her statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The budget also detailed expectations for the UC System, but it held no requirements to maintain current tuition rates. The UC has proposed a tuition increase over five years to fund financial aid and other campus needs, with the UC Regents voting on the increase Jan. 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarveshwar stated that “UCSA also hopes to work with the Governor’s office and members of the legislature to secure the funding necessary to avoid a tuition increase.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s proposed budget took into account the “significant growth” of the UCs in the past few years, and this year’s budget increase seems intended to do the same, as the proposal states that its 10 campuses now enroll more than 280,000 students, as opposed to far smaller numbers merely a decade ago. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newsom’s budget will not go into effect until it is voted on by the state legislature in June. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

Alia Reynolds, president and UCSB coordinator of Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), led conversation with administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel discussed plans to further educate students on sexual assault prevention, including expanding mandatory sexual violence and harassment training to all clubs and sports teams and putting trainings online through GauchoSpace. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key distinction between SASA and UCSB’s position about what action to take in light of recent allegations is the university’s mutual no-contact orders, which state that neither respondent or survivor can be near one another in shared public spaces. SASA, per Reynolds, claimed during the town hall that this prohibits survivors from accessing areas integral to their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA supports California Senate Bill 493, which, as Reynolds explained in the meeting, aims to ensure that sexual assault survivors have equal access to education through the abolition of mutual no-contact orders and resources for survivors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC currently does not support the abolition of mutual no-contact orders, SASA explained during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the panel discussion, Tallin Moyer, a member of SASA and Pi Beta Phi sorority, read a statement on sexual violence in Greek life and requested updates on other concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Greek life can provide a facility for leadership and self-growth — however, it is unacceptable that we as a Greek community have not realized the true magnititude of how our system enables sexual violence,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Members of Greek life need to realize how fraternities foster rape culture and put individual safety at risk. It is unacceptable to think these events have occurred in a vacuum.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public comment, one Greek life-affiliated student voiced her concerns about Sigma Pi’s participation in Arrowjam, an annual dance competition hosted by sorority Pi Beta Phi in order to raise money for Read &gt; Lead &gt; Achieve — a charity dedicated to children’s literacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moyer, whose sorority hosted the philanthropy, told the student that she understood the concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree with you, that was not taken into consideration at all, and I hear you, that it could be triggering to see them up there … It was the opinion of some of the women in our sorority that not all the men in Sigma Pi should be punished for the actions of a few. But I totally understand the concern, and [we] will be talking to our president about it,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sigma Pi went on to compete and win the fraternity portion of the competition, which occurred on Nov. 8, eight days before the SASA Town Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SASA also promoted its Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Map at the town hall. The map, facilitated by SASA, includes the UCSB campus and surrounding Isla Vista community. Anyone can anonymously report instances of sexual violence or harassment, which are pinned onto the digital map. Yellow pins stand for one report at a location and red stands for multiple. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s mostly faith-based, although I am cautious about calling it that, but we are in the sense of believing survivors. But we see everything that goes through, and we monitor it closely,” Moyer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds then inquired to administrators about the Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) training email, which was sent to the entire student body on Nov. 1, soon after a timely warning email was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sent out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about a reported sexual assault at Sigma Pi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We personally were concerned about the timeliness of the email about R.A.D., because obviously it was sent out during a very triggering, emotional time for many students,” she said. “The email only served to increase these feelings. We were also concerned that the email mentioned only women, which seemed to exclude men and gender non-conforming folks.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Ollman, representative for SBSO, explained that while the timing of the email was unfortunate, it had already been scheduled and pre-selected. R.A.D. training is heavily overviewed by the national organization and leaves little room for individual departments to change gender pronouns or create more inclusive wording, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explanation regarding email alerts for the student body was another topic of discussion throughout the town hall. UCSB has two forms of communication for alerts: emergency notifications and timely warnings, which fall under Clery Act jurisdiction. The Clery Act mandates public safety reports on specific crime categories, including sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emergency notifications are “designed to give information about ongoing threats,” UCPD’s Community Service Officer Ariel Bournes explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Timely Warning Notices fall under a different, highly specific category of warning, and failing to issue one that meets the criteria means a potential fine of up to $57,300, according to Associate Dean of Student Life Miles Ashlock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we become aware of something that violates the Clery Act, we are mandated to report it, simply because a report has been filed and not because it has been investigated. The university is mandated to send Clery warnings only about Clery crimes that occur on university property… it’s a really bizarre, unique set of circumstances,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds also inquired about the safety prevention tips issued in one such timely warning, including covering one’s drink or never taking drinks from strangers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel like the burden is being placed on the survivor once again, especially when the tips are things like, ‘Cover your drink, don’t take drinks from strangers,’ she explained to Ashlock. “We know these things. These things aren’t new to us. You are expecting people to control their own safety, in a sense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashlcok responded by stating that “one of the challenges of violence prevention education is coming at it from all these different angles.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to have a clear message against violence in the community. There is not one proven method of violence prevention. There are a lot of different things, and not all of them feel good even to us, but we want to provide a variety of tools so in aggregate we reduce the rates of violence in our community,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, many students still had concerns about the existence of sexual violence within UCSB’s Greek life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t just put a Band-Aid over this,” Moyer said in response to one student concerned about a lack of accountability within fraternities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To truly eradicate this culture and make a change, we can’t just remove one specific fraternity, but instead perform surgery on our culture as a Greek community.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

<em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall gave planning services company KTUA  — which provides analysis and improves landscapes and transportation systems — an opportunity to share its concepts for redesigned UCSB transport, which will be implemented in the coming years to accommodate several new campus buildings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, despite a call for student voices to be involved in the new design, only six UCSB students attended the town hall when “we would have liked two hundred,” Tom Bertulis, a senior transportation engineer with KTUA, lamented. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One community member spoke out about the lack of student voices at the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You think that students have the time to come to a two-hour meeting? Students are very busy, and that’s why they can’t come. If you need them to answer these questions, maybe email them,” he half-jokingly told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Bertulis began his presentation, he touched upon UCSB’s recent platinum-level bike friendliness designation, noting that UCSB is one of eight colleges in the nation to receive it and emphasizing the campus’s “unique bike culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Here, there are almost 1,300 bike trips in a peak 15-minute period. I’ve never seen anything like this… there are definitely unique challenges this campus faces in regards to bikes. Even a freeway can’t handle that many cars in such a short period,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alissa Hummer, director of Campus Planning and Design, explained the campus expansion that the renovated transit plans are meant to address, which include the construction of a new lecture hall that will begin within the next one and a half years, with 540 new faculty residences and a new student housing project in the near future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we need to not have people bike on the interior of campus and just put bike racks on the outside?” Hummer asked. “It’s something to consider. At this point, everything is on the table.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new lecture hall, which is being built to accommodate increased class sizes, will most likely divert bike traffic onto UCen Road, she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think students understand the constraints of building a new lecture hall, but they understandably have some trepidation. We haven’t yet tried to mix bikes and cars in the same transport lane, but it will only be for about a block,” Hummer said. “In addition, we will most likely need new bike paths coming into the western side of campus to accommodate the new housing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prevalence of campus biking is why second-year environmental science major Sophie Roberts, a member of the A.S. Environmental Affairs Board, decided to attend the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s important to maintain the bike paths that we have, and even add new ones because there’s so much bike traffic here already that closing paths could be dangerous,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For example, I have a class in the Psych Building, and then 10 minutes later I have a class on the other side of campus, and it’s physically impossible for me to get there by walking, which is why it’s so important to me we keep the bike paths.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Samarin, a KTUA consultant, emphasized wanting to clear up misconceptions students might have about the remodelling and removal of various bike paths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The university has proposed some things, which are at this point just proposals. We’re here today to listen to feedback and see how people feel,” Samarin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In regards to closing bike paths, that would be for paths that are underused. We might be able to repurpose those for shuttles. It’s not removing paths just to remove them, it would be to accommodate other mobility,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertulis also brought up the idea of autonomous campus shuttles known as Neighborhood Electric Vehicles, which are futuristic-looking white shuttles that could hypothetically transport students to opposite ends of campus and provide an alternative mode of transport for students who have trouble walking across campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was speaking to someone who represents the disabled population on campus and currently we have Uber and Lyft reimbursement for students who need a shuttle type of service. But we’re looking at more regular type of shuttle that could come more regularly and serve a larger demographic, if there’s demand,” Samarin explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making campus transportation more accessible for disabled individuals was a key point throughout the moderated conversation at the town hall. Currently, making sure handicapped individuals have the transport services they need is one of KTUA’s “number one priorities,” Bertulis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the town hall, Hummer ended her conversation with a question for students and staff alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We really have to look at this bike system that was never formally designed but was put together piece by piece by piece. We need to look at how it’s circulating. Are the bones of this system good and just need some tweaking, or is it fundamentally broken and we need to retool it all together?”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-87302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Deltopia (pictured in 2019) is typically a break-all-the-rules block party. Ludicity’s proposal would provide an alternative festival to Deltopia. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial proposal of a festival led many UC Santa Barbara students and community members to believe that Lucidity’s event would completely shut down Deltopia, as expressed at the town hall. However, members of Lucidity’s board of directors negated these rumors and expressed its hopes that the alternative festival would develop a more positive, fun-filled environment that would help channel the Deltopia crowds into a safer space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not invested in doing this if people don’t want it,” Lucidity Director Ron Glover said. “We were asked to come and we decided we’d give it a shot… we don’t have a magic wand, but we’ve been successful at what we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity has faced pushback from both sides of the community around its involvement in the event. Some UCSB students have expressed concern over parting with their beloved Deltopia tradition, while other Isla Vista residents present at the town hall noted they would prefer to abolish the event entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was [an] overwhelming response that students don’t want to see it rebranded,” Lucidity Founder and Marketing Director Jonah Gabriel Haas said. “It comes from an idea that this is going to change or take away their beloved Deltopia party, and that’s not what we’re trying to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/lucidity-festival-budget-reduced-by-20000-following-district-concerns/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> its proposed Deltopia festival budget by $20,000, leaving it with a $159,850 price tag in order to get the program underway, which places special emphasis on harm reduction and collaboration with the community. This includes the unique concept of “Guardians,” a specially trained group of people dedicated to de-escalating situations to reduce the need for law enforcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Guardian team would serve as a buffer between students and law enforcement so that the vast majority of things, whether they be medical or conflicts, can be de-escalated, mediated and taken care of before escalating to law enforcement,” Haas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the town hall, many concerned community members placed an emphasis on their fear of outsiders coming into I.V. and wreaking havoc with no sense of personal responsibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haas noted that Lucidity’s goal is “to make the event awesome enough for crowds to come off Del Playa, but not so awesome that we attract huge out-of-town crowds.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team hopes to accomplish this by enlisting local artists to play at two different stages in Anisq’Oyo’ Park and People’s Park, which will hopefully encourage students to enjoy the music without drawing in outsiders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lucidity also explained its hopes for a more family-friendly event in the future. However, the team acknowledged that since this is the first iteration of the event, they wanted to prioritize the age range that the original Deltopia appealed to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kiyomi Morrison, UCSB’s A.S. Program Board commissioner, expressed her fears that Lucidity’s event would take away from the Program Board’s Warm Up event, which aims to act as a safe space that provides live music, drinks, snacks and other necessities to potentially inebriated students after Deltopia. She explained that after Deltopia and a Lucidity Festival, students might be too tired to attend the school-sanctioned nighttime event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also raised concern regarding the price tag, which the I.V. Community Services District explained would be covered by the district and other organizations who could potentially support the event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree that I think trying stuff is important and you won’t know… but it’s a $159,000 try,” Morrison said. “Can you justify spending that much on this event, rather than medical tents, drug testing, water or food that could help Deltopia in another way?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Lucidity returned to the point made at the beginning of the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If this works, it works, and we couldn’t ask for anything better,” Glover said. “If it doesn’t, we won’t do it again… instead of not trying, and saying what if it doesn’t work, well, what if it does?”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23421bdf58a18a5a252678d37919e8ed?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/hollyrusch/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Holly Rusch</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Holly Rusch is an asst. news editor for the Daily Nexus.
