Finishing the year at just 8-22 overall and 3-13 in conference play, Santa Barbara barely qualified for the Big West Tournament, losing to UC Davis in the first round.</p>\n<p>In that loss, UCSB’s seniors scored every point in the second-half comeback. Losing its entire starting backcourt to graduation, the Gauchos will miss the majority of its scoring as senior guards Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason accounted for 64.3 percent of the team’s offense.</p>\n<p>All three averaged double-digit scoring for Santa Barbara and were the only players to do so. Nesbit and Zornig both hit the 1,000-point career milestone this season and were named All-Big West Honorable Mention selections.</p>\n<p>“They understand that they’re not going to be remembered by their last record. All of them left here better players,” Mitchell said. “All have signed with agents and will have a chance to play in Europe.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Santa Barbara does return seven players. In fact, its two returning starters are at the two positions most difficult to replace. Next season, freshman point guard Onome Jemerigbe will return as a sophomore after being named to the Big West All-Freshmen team this season and averaging 5.8 points and 2.2 assists while running the show for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Playing center, junior Clair Watkins will play her first full season with the Gauchos after joining the team in December this season. Watkins found her stride toward the end of the year, averaging 8.6 points and 8.4 rebounds in the last seven games.</p>\n<p>Along with junior guard Kristine Brance, Watkins will be expected to be the leader of next year’s squad.</p>\n<p>“I think our upperclassmen have had a great postseason and have worked harder than any group in my three years here,” Mitchell said. “Some of that you can talk up to the bitter taste we had in our mouth. Now they realize you have three senior guards leaving and someone has to step up. I’ve told Clair she has the ability to be one of the best post players in the conference. When she’s willing to step up and carry that burden, then we’ll be a big-time team.”</p>\n<p>While Mitchell looks to replace the offense lost from the graduating seniors with this year’s recruits, the focus will return to the defensive end. This season, the Gauchos scored more points than any team during Mitchell’s reign, but also gave up the most points of any of her past teams.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to go back to being that really mean, tough, defensive team,” Mitchell said. “I think a combination of us trying to prove we could score 70 points a game this season … somehow we didn’t have the mindset or mentality to put away close games. So you know a lot of that will be put on my shoulders to make sure out team knows what our identity will look like, but I don’t think it will be hard to convince them after our record this year.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, in recruiting, Mitchell looked for versatile players while looking to add height to the roster.</p>\n<p>“We were looking for versatility and more of a physical presence body-wise. At the end of the day, most of the time it was on the defensive end we had a hard time matching up with people because of our lack of size,” Mitchell said. “At the championship level or when you get to March, it’s about grinding it out in the half court, both offensively and defensively. All play for great programs and they know what it takes to win. That’s, to me, the biggest thing.”</p>\n<p>This year’s recruiting class includes guard Dioseline Lopez, guard/forward Chaya Durr, guard Makala Roper, guard Taylor Farris and forward/center Sabrina Callahan.</p>\n<p><strong>Dioseline Lopez</strong></p>\n<p>Mitchell’s newest recruit, Lopez, is a 5’6” guard transferring from East Los Angeles College. Averaging 14.3 points per game and leading the South Coast Conference in assists, rebounds and steals with 7.4, 4.3 and 2.3 per game, respectively, Lopez was named SCC North Division Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>Lopez was also named to the All-SCC North First Team for the second time and the California Community College Athletic Association All-State Third Team.</p>\n<p>“It only took me watching film on Dee to see that swag she has. She was able to play with our kids, and right away they were begging us to take her,” Mitchell said. “She’s a true point guard, but like Nic, has the ability to score a lot. I think [she] will relieve some of the pressure from Onome thinking that she has to carry the burden.”</p>\n<p>Lopez brings more depth to the point guard position, but can also serve as a scoring threat for UCSB. Leading her team to the second round of the CCCAA Southern California playoffs, she scored 33 points and six assists in a tight 92-88 overtime loss.</p>\n<p>“She’ll run the show, she’ll facilitate, but if we need her to score, she has that ability,” Mitchell said. “She has toughness. She hasn’t had the easiest path to get here, and that’s okay with me because she has that fire to prove to everyone she can play at this level.”</p>\n<p><strong>Chaya Durr</strong></p>\n<p>Durr missed her senior season at Sacramento High School with an ACL tear, but should be 100 percent ready to go in August or September. She will join teammate Jasmine Ware as the second Sac High Lady Dragon on the Gaucho roster.</p>\n<p>“I have no problem saying it: We would’ve never signed her if she hadn’t have torn her ACL,” Mitchell said. “But I’m not worried about her missing her senior year of high school. We know what she’s capable of.”</p>\n<p>Playing the guard or forward position and listed at 5’11”, Durr averaged a double-double during her junior year with 18 points and 12 rebounds per contest. She also tallied 4.0 steals and 1.3 blocks per game. As a result, Durr was named all-city and an all-league first team member.</p>\n<p>“She’s a big-time athlete, very passionate and can make a huge difference on the [boards],” Mitchell said. “Defensively, she’s one of those that, if we want to press — and if you saw the team our last game of the year against Davis, that’s the style that will fit Chaya and help us have more of an up-tempo look.”</p>\n<p><strong>Makala Roper</strong></p>\n<p>A combination guard from Cleveland High School in Seattle, 5’8” Roper earned 3A Player of the Year honors this year after helping her team win the Class 3A State Girls Basketball title as both a junior and senior. Roper was honored with the MVP trophy of the Class 3A All-Tournament Team as well.</p>\n<p>“She’s a lefty and a deadly shooter,” Mitchell said. “She could play a little bit of point because she has great handles and even though she puts up big numbers and has the reputation of being a scorer, we know she’s a great passer and facilitator.”</p>\n<p>Leading her team to an undefeated 16-0 conference record, the player her teammates call “Sniper” averaged 16.3 points per game her senior year. In addition, according to MaxPreps, Roper is the top-ranked player in Washington.</p>\n<p>“She’ll be able to play the scoring position,” Mitchell said. “Losing Mel Zornig, she should give us that three-point shooter that we have graduating.”</p>\n<p><strong>Taylor Farris</strong></p>\n<p>Farris joins the Gauchos from Renton, Washington. Listed at 5’11”, Farris was named the League MVP as a junior. The same year, she led Renton High to third place, its best finish in the 2A State Tournament since 1987.</p>\n<p>“Taylor Farris is a long athlete,” Mitchell said. “She’s better around the basket and the rim. She works well in tight quarters and has great timing. ”</p>\n<p>Playing the guard position, Farris averaged 20.9 points, 10.6 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 7.3 steals and 4.1 blocks her senior season.</p>\n<p>“She played at a smaller high school, but played for one of the top AAU programs, so we have no question she can come right in with her length — she gets tons of deflections,” Mitchell said. “Her comfort level may be the four right now because she’s great from the high post, but at some point, she shoots it well enough she’ll be able to move out to a perimeter position for us.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sabrina Callahan</strong></p>\n<p>Playing at forward or center at one of the women’s basketball powerhouses in Southern California, La Jolla Country Day School, Callahan averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.9 blocks per game. At 6’0”, she also shot 51 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“From day one, I told my staff I wanted a kid that played for Terri Bamford. She’s that good and that respected at La Jolla Country Day,” Mitchell said. “Her kids typically play with her all through their AAU program also, so they’re well-coached and understand the skills.”</p>\n<p>This season, Callahan earned All-San Diego Section second team honors.</p>\n<p>“Sabrina understands all the little things it takes to win, whether it’s screening, being a great passer, and a lot of times she’s the one out there directing traffic on the floor from the four position,” Mitchell said. “She gives us size, she gives us versatility and at some point she’ll move over to the wing position as well.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s basketball team will begin its season in November. Included on the schedule will be LSU, which was a Sweet 16 team in the NCAA Tournament last season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of June 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55765\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55765\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-05/womens-basketball-returning-to-dominance/","id":509,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[508,507,506],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"From NorCal to SoCal: Returning  to Playoff-Caliber Teams","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sports-art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kings Need To Be Aggressive During Offseason","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>From afar, it might look like the start of the “New Era” for the Sacramento Kings was completely unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>After all, Sacramento’s record this year of 28-54 was exactly equivalent to the team’s record the year before. No gain, no loss. Either way, that’s eight consecutive years not qualifying for the playoffs.</p>\n<p>However, there is a different energy in the city. People in Sac Town are excited about the potential of the Kings. There is buzz about the new arena.

At times this season, it was visible. Sacramento beat excellent playoff teams such as Houston, Miami and Portland. However, the Kings lacked consistency, especially on defense, falling to some of worst teams in the NBA.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest positives to take away from this season is that the front office proved it is willing to do whatever it takes to make the team good now. General Manager Pete D’Alessandro made great strides with Rudy Gay early in the season, giving Kings a “Big Three” of their own in Gay, point guard Isaiah Thomas and center DeMarcus Cousins.</p>\n<p>Looking to next season, the biggest need is to ensure all the big pieces to the current squad stay intact, unless the Kings can trade or sign a franchise-changing player. But it needs to be a player who management has great faith will stay in Sacramento. There’s talk of trying to trade for All-Star Kevin Love, but it’s risky to sign a player that could pack up and move a year after signing when his contract expires.</p>\n<p>Thomas is a restricted free agent during the offseason. There’s currently talk of trading Thomas, but the young underdog has proved he can hold his own in this league and be a great point guard.</p>\n<p>Last season, Thomas averaged 20.3 points, 6.3 assists and 2.9 rebounds per game. Obtaining another point guard would be smart, but having the ball in Thomas’ hands led to nothing but good things last season. Don’t mess with it now.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Gay also can become an unrestricted free agent if he decides not to exercise his player option worth $19.3 million for the 2014-15 season. Gay had the best year of his career with California’s capital city, setting career-highs in points per game, field goal percentage and assists per game. His ability to score at the small forward position and his versatility greatly aided the Kings. Keep him in purple and black too.</p>\n<p>As for the last member of the Big Three, Cousins needs to mature, and fast. The Kings need him on the court, not in foul trouble or being suspended for technical fouls. He led the NBA in ‘T’s’ again this season.</p>\n<p>Cousins has the talent and frame to be a franchise player. He was great this year, improving his efficiency on the offensive end, but if he can mentally become strong to the point where he’s not committing silly turnovers and taking possessions off on defense, he could easily be an all-star next season. It’s time for him to step up and lead by example.</p>\n<p>The biggest area of need for the Kings in the offseason is at the shooting guard position. Rookie Ben McLemore simply isn’t ready. This season, he showed he has bad hands; he needs great improvement with his ball handling and he’s not the shooter anyone expected him to be.</p>\n<p>In an overall disappointing season for McLemore, the Kings traded Marcus Thornton, showing the Kings want McLemore to be a big part of their future. With drastic improvement, maybe he could be, but not now.<br>\nThe Kings didn’t have the greatest luck in the lottery, receiving the No. 8 pick, but Sacramento was the first to put that pick up for a trade in order to ensure immediate talent and success. It’s certainly the smartest tactic for the organization right now.</p>\n<p>Sacramento is in need of consistent perimeter shooting. A good passer would be favorable. It needs players who can play defense and buy into Malone’s style.</p>\n<p>I don’t expect Jason Terry to stay, so some veteran leadership could greatly benefit the young squad too.</p>\n<p>As long as management continues on its plan of immediate success, the Kings have players they can build around.</p>\n<p>The city is ready to win. The front office has the right mentality to win. The players need to believe they can win. It’s time to make it happen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 12 of April 28th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55650\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55650\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/from-norcal-to-socal-returning-to-playoff-caliber-teams-2/","id":3254,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3253,3252,3251],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Sports Editors Say Their Goodbyes: Kristen Henneman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SportsEditorsPeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SportsEditorsPeterVandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kristen and Paul-Michael Dish on UCSB, Isla Vista and Their Time as Sports Editors  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“The thing about doing what you love is you never know if it’s going to happen and you never know if you’re going to get to do it one more day, but the fact that you’re doing it right now or trying to do it or working towards it, it’s like stepping stones.

Technically nothing. In fact, on a scale from one to 10, their correlation would probably be a negative two.</p>\n<p>Yet, this quote perfectly describes my four years with this paper and my two years as the Sports Editor because the fact is, most people search for a lifetime to find a job they love.

These four years have flown by and now, after studying for more hours than I’d like to count, writing hundreds of articles, spending dozens of late nights/new days in the Nexus office and having countless laughs, I formally say goodbye to the school (and that wonderful beach less than 10 minutes from my doorstep) I love so much.</p>\n<p>SB has truly become my home. My time in Santa Barbara and with the Nexus has only been a part of my journey, but what a journey it’s been.</p>\n<p>In my time here with the Nexus, I’ve written the season of our men’s soccer team that at one point was No. 2 in the nation. I wrote the track season in 2012 when we had athletes make it to Olympic Trials. I’ve done a one-on-one interview with three-time Olympic Gold Medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings. I’ve sat courtside in the Honda Center not once, but twice, to watch our women’s basketball team in the Big West Playoffs, including watching the team win the title in 2012. I’ve won a CCMA award for a column I wrote on Title IX. And most recently, this year, I received the opportunity to interview the Sacramento Kings, my hometown team, during training camp here at UCSB.</p>\n<p>My experience with the Nexus has truly exceeded anything I could ever imagine and I am truly honored to have brought you your sports coverage every day.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, while I’m going to leave the philosophical stuff to my co-editor, I do have two pieces of advice for you all.</p>\n<p>It may be cliché, but find something you love and never let anyone tell you that you can’t or that you’re not good enough. I tell people all the time I would pay others to do my job. It’s one of the best feelings in the world.<br>\nThe second is to enjoy the sports here. No, we’re not a part of the Pac-12 and we don’t have an elite football team, but we have some fantastic teams here on campus. Give them a shot.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have some major thank yous to give out. First, thank you to my friends and family for your support and always reading my articles when I tell you to. Thank you to the athletic department for not only your verbal, but financial support. Thanks to every coach and athlete I’ve ever interviewed. I know I’m just a pain for you guys a lot of the time, but I really do enjoy and appreciate your time. Thank you to the 2011 softball team, my first ever team with the Nexus, for making me fall in love with sports journalism all over again.</p>\n<p>A very special shout out to the women’s basketball teams the last three years. I’ve written every game covered by the Nexus during the Carlene Mitchell era and some of those moments have been my favorite during my time here. Of course, a very big thank you to Coach Mitch. You’re the coach I’ve most gotten to know on campus and I’ve loved every second talking with you and getting to pick your brain about women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my staff, especially my co-editor PMO (we’ve made the best team), for putting up with my perfectionistic ways deep into the night. And most importantly, to the readers — you are the reason we’ve been the No. 9 newspaper the last two years. Keep it up.</p>\n<p>Because I hate goodbyes, I’m simply going to say see you later, UCSB.<br>\nLove,</p>\n<p>Kristen</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-kristen-henneman/","id":2067,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2066,2065,2064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Four Freshmen Set to Take Spotlight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-02.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-02.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB finished just one win shy of taking the Big West title this season.

They created an atmosphere where this team could perform and could focus on the right things,” Galicinao said. “The way this group came together and played for each other, I’ve been here for nine years and this year was definitely special and different.”</p>\n<p>To fill the voids and hopefully create an even better team for next season, Galicinao brings in four recruits to Santa Barbara next season.</p>\n<p>The first is Jessica Johnston from Studio City, CA.  Johnston is a lefty outfielder who was the captain of her squad at Harvard-Westlake High School.</p>\n<p>In her senior year, Johnston batted .474 and tallied nine doubles. In addition, during her three years on the varsity squad, she recorded a .464 on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re always trying to bring in well-rounded athletes,” Galicinao said. “[Jessica] hits from the left side and hits for power. She has a good arm as well.”</p>\n<p>Coming to Santa Barbara from Norwalk, CA, Samantha Lujan has the potential to play catcher or the corners for UCSB. In her first three years at Norwalk High School, Lujan owned a .358 batting average and a .403 on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ third incoming freshman next season is a right-handed pitcher, Lena Mayer. Originally from Berkeley, CA, Mayer earned a 1.74 ERA her senior year at Berkeley High School. Offensively, she held a .427 batting average during her four years, including a .438 average her senior year, while holding a .526 on-base percentage in her final season.</p>\n<p>“We have a pitcher coming in who has good velocity and throws the down ball,” Galicinao said. “She’s similar to [senior Andriana Collins], except AC is left-handed.”</p>\n<p>The final recruit for Santa Barbara for 2014 is utility Kayla Sisson, who was ranked the sixth-best high school player in Nevada. Coming to Santa Barbara from Tahoe City, CA, Sisson played with the Lady Magic travel team in Sacramento. However, playing for Reno High School, she tallied a .402 slugging percentage and a .326 on-base percentage her senior year.</p>\n<p>These four freshman will join a talented group of Gauchos this season, including Big West Freshman of the Year Kristen Clark, All-Big West first team member Shelby Wisdom, second team-member MeShalon Moore and honorable mention selection Emily Brucelas.</p>\n<p>According to Galicinao, this group could be an extremely dangerous offensive team as these recruits add even more offense to the lineup. This season, UCSB ranked toward the top in nearly every offensive category.</p>\n<p>“There were some games (this year) where we were shut down and I think there will be less of those because a lot of our high performers are going to be back,” Galicinao said. “They’re going to be older and they’ll be stronger. I think you’re going to see a smarter offensive team and a team that continues to rally off of each other.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 22, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55466\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/four-freshmen-set-to-take-spotlight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55466\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/four-freshmen-set-to-take-spotlight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/four-freshmen-set-to-take-spotlight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/four-freshmen-set-to-take-spotlight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/four-freshmen-set-to-take-spotlight/","id":1095,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1094,1093,1092],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miami Trails Elite Dynasties of the NBA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Nexus sports editor Kristen Henneman discusses the Heat's place in NBA history.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the sports world today, the worth of any player or team is based upon how many championships they own.</p>\n<p>Personal accolades and regular season awards are great, but if you can’t win rings, you can forget being considered in the conversation for the best of all time.</p>\n<p>Currently fighting to stand on the list for best franchises of all time is the Miami Heat.

More recently, Los Angeles won three-straight titles in 2000-02 behind one of the best duos in NBA history in Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Bulls have also known the glory of the three-peat twice, accomplishing it in 1991-93 and 1996-98. Chicago, of course, was led by arguably the best player to ever play the game of basketball, Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>The team standing above all however, is the Boston Celtics. The Celtics utterly dominated the basketball world in the sixties, winning eight championships in a row and 11 in 13 years from 1957-69. The master behind the success? A 6’10’’ center by the name of Bill Russell.</p>\n<p>Russell, who is underrated when it comes to listing the best players of all time, holds the record for the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls, the Heat features one of the best players to ever grace a basketball court and certainly the best player currently playing the game right now: LeBron James. Miami also features the “Big Three” in James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, which has captivated audiences all over the world.</p>\n<p>The Heat’s fast-paced, flashy play and incredible talent make them one of the most entertaining teams of all time if nothing else. They also play at a time where the level of competition around the league is much higher (excluding the Eastern Conference this season).</p>\n<p>Every year now, there are a handful of teams fighting for the NBA Championship rather than just a couple teams that were powerhouses decades ago. It does make the idea of a three-peat seem even more remarkable.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, when it all comes down to it, it’s all about the rings. Boston leads the NBA in championships with an incredible 17 titles. The Lakers don’t rank far behind with 16.</p>\n<p>Considering that a sports dynasty is defined as “a team that dominates its sport or league for an extraordinary length of time,” these are the two teams that should be considered dynasties.</p>\n<p>They’re always in the hunt and rarely have off years. They’re the teams everyone wants to be a part of because there’s always a good chance to make history.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, the Lakers and Celtics are the best teams in NBA history. Period.</p>\n<p>With that said, Chicago would have to come next on the list for ranking of the best team with six crowns, all coming in the electrifying era that was Jordan.</p>\n<p>The Jordan Era made Chicago a destination for great players and a city that desired greatness in the basketball world. Nevertheless, the Bulls are still looking for that next group to bring home more rings and give the Bulls multiple eras of greatness.</p>\n<p>As for Miami, which currently owns three championships, another title would bring the Heat’s total to four, tying it for fourth-most crowns in NBA history with San Antonio.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Miami will go down as one of the most elite franchises in the NBA if it can three-peat in June, but four franchise championships is a long way off from 17, 16 or even six crowns.<br>\nAnd considering that the number of championships determines your worth, the Heat still have a long way to go if it wants to move up in the ranking for best team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 21, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/miami-trails-elite-dynasties-of-the-nba/","id":526,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[525,524,523],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Fails to Capture First League Title","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SoftballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SoftballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos fall 2-1 to Long Beach State in the final series of the regular season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Shelby Wisdom crouched down on the pitcher’s mound and mumbled something to herself, clearly frustrated and disappointed.</p>\n<p>The junior had just given up a grand slam and the eighth run of the inning to Long Beach State.

UCSB ends its season with the highest win percentage (.630) in program history and tied the record for most wins in a single season in program history.</p>\n<p>Individually, Wisdom becomes the first Gaucho to record consecutive 20-plus win seasons and now owns the record for most wins in a single season for a pitcher with 63, finishing at 22-15 on the year. Freshman left fielder Kristen Clark also shattered the single season hit record of 75 against Hawaii, finishing the year with 90 hits. She also broke the single season batting average of .417 with a .437 average.</p>\n<p>However, the one record that mattered most for UCSB was winning its first ever Big West title, and the Gauchos didn’t get the job done.</p>\n<p>“From the start, we talked about the Big West [Championship] and being there in the end. No one really thought we could be there in the end,” senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil said. “We came up a little short and they were just a little more clutch than we were.”</p>\n<p>The Big West crown came down to the final day of the regular season after Santa Barbara evened the series at one, thanks to a five-run fourth inning.</p>\n<p>Winning 6-3, sophomore catcher Meme Moore anchored the Gauchos offensively, hitting 1-2 with three RBI. Brucelas also went 3-3 at the plate with one run and one RBI while Wisdom hit 1-2 with two runs. Wisdom finished the weekend with four runs and two RBI on 4-7 hitting, including 2-3 with two runs and two RBI in Saturday’s critical rubber game.</p>\n<p>“The second game they played a lot looser. In general, they had better-quality at bats,” Galicinao said. “Long Beach even pulled ahead in that second game, but we were able to punch right back. All the way to the last pitch, you can’t ever count this group out.”</p>\n<p>Game one, on the other hand, swung Long Beach’s way as Santa Barbara gave up four home runs and fell 7-5.</p>\n<p>“Long Beach is a really good hitting team and when you throw it in their wheelhouse, the chances are they’re going to hit it pretty hard,” Galicinao said. “Being the series that it was, [Shelby] was amped up, throwing a little bit harder. They took advantage.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 12th, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55268\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55268\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/ucsb-fails-to-capture-first-league-title/","id":1094,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1093,1092,1091],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Long Beach State With NCAA Tournament Berth at the Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-09.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-09.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB battles Long Beach State as both teams are tied atop the Big West Conference standings entering the last week of the season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The long-awaited showdown is finally here.</p>\n<p>The top two teams in the Big West square off this weekend at Campus Diamond in a battle for the Big West Championship and a ticket to the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>For the UCSB softball team, the math is simple.

It’s our last weekend at home and it’s our last series in conference, so we’re going to play with our hearts and go all out. We just to have to know that we’re better and that we can do it.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach travels to Santa Barbara at 36-16 overall and 13-5 in conference. Third-place Cal Poly also figures into the mix, just one game behind both the Gauchos and 49ers. The Mustangs play last-place UC Riverside this weekend.</p>\n<p>While both Santa Barbara and CSULB stand atop the standings, it is the Gauchos that carry the momentum as winners of 12 of their last 14 games. UCSB will also have the advantage of playing at home for its seniors with Senior Day on Sunday. Long Beach, on the other hand, was swept by Cal Poly last weekend to lose control of its lead in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>“We’re all really excited. Even at practice today, we had a big team talk about how we want to see our name on that selection show on Sunday,” junior third baseman Jenessa Jeppesen said. “We have to take it one game at a time.”</p>\n<p>After sweeping Riverside last weekend, sophomore catcher Meme Moore was named Big West Field Player of the Week. Moore had an incredible series, tallying a slugging percentage of .800 and a batting average of .600. In the series finale, she hit 4-4 with two runs and two RBI. Moore is currently tied for first in the Big West in doubles with 13.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, Wisdom was on her game as well, as she gave up just three earned runs in the circle while hitting 6-10 from the plate with three runs and one RBI on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>At 21-13, Wisdom is approaching an important milestone this weekend. Currently tied with Sandy Ortigies for most career wins at 62, Wisdom could etch her name into the UCSB record books with a win against Long Beach. Ortigies’ record has stood since 1987.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, the record doesn’t really matter to me unless we get those two wins,” Wisdom said. “I’m only a win away and that one win won’t matter. We need [two].”</p>\n<p>One thing these two teams have in common is that offense can come from anyone. Last weekend, the Gauchos’ offensive success was a team effort. In game one, for example, seven of 10 players in the Santa Barbara lineup got a hit and five had at least two hits.</p>\n<p>One of Santa Barbara’s biggest offensive weapons is freshman left fielder Kristen Clark, who leads the league in batting average (.432) and in hits (83). The lead-off hitter leads the league in hits by a large margin with the second-ranked player with 67, 16 less than Clark. Two weekends ago against Hawaii, she broke the single-season UCSB hits record previously owned by Assistant Coach Christine Ramos.</p>\n<p>“It helps a lot when we get our bunts down and move runners around,” Wisdom said. “Hitting is contagious, so once one person gets a hit, the next person can get a hit easier.”</p>\n<p>The 49ers’ success also relies on offensive production from multiple players. Senior second baseman Cya Neal is tied for third in the Big West in runs and ranks fifth in hits, while sophomore left fielder Darian Tautalafua sits in fifth in conference in runs. Furthermore, junior shortstop Shayna Kimbrough ranks fourth in conference in hits and third in batting average. Teammate and senior right fielder Sarah Carrasco is tied for first with Meme Moore in doubles. Senior catcher Karli Sandoval and senior first baseman Ashlynn Booker sit in third and fifth in league in RBI, respectively. Booker also ranks sixth in home runs.</p>\n<p>As a team, Long Beach leads the league in runs, hits, RBI, batting average and on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>“They can read the defense well, so we need to make sure we don’t let them read us,” Wisdom said. “[Long Beach wants] exactly what we want, so they’re going to come out and compete and we need to be ready for it.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, senior Erin Jones-Wesley is LBSU’s top-pitcher. Her ERA of 2.96 ranks third in the Big West.

No one really gets to say they’ve played with their sister at the DI level.”</p>\n<p>The two are nearly inseparable. Not only do they go to school and play together, but they live together as well.</p>\n<p>“There’s only one time we’ve been apart and that’s when I was a senior in high school and she was a freshman in college,” Meme said. “That was actually really hard for me because she’s always been with me. For the first week she was gone, I slept in her bed.”</p>\n<p>As Sacramento natives, DeJanee and Meme have played softball together their entire lives and in 2011, won a Sac-Joaquin Section Division I Championship together at Sheldon High School.</p>\n<p>“I think we batted back-to-back (in high school), so it was the Moore duo,” DeJanee said. “It was cool to share that moment with her. [Playing together isn’t] new to us. Over the years, we’ve gotten closer. I don’t think when we were younger we liked it very much.”</p>\n<p>The sisters even committed to UCSB at the same time, deciding to play softball in Santa Barbara when DeJanee was 15 and Meme was 14.</p>\n<p>“She wanted to go to the same school as me, but I [originally] didn’t, being with her all the time,” Meme said. “Plus, we committed early, so we weren’t as close as we are now. I wanted to go to a different school and branch out and get my space, but it worked out.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, despite their closeness and genetics, the Moore sisters have very different personalities and are extremely different players.</p>\n<p>“Their personalities are so different; that’s what makes it even more fun,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They live together and to hear them talk with each other, there’s a mutual respect and love, but they also give each other a hard time. It’s fun to see.”</p>\n<p>DeJanee is energetic and the leader of the two sisters while Meme is more calm and laid-back.</p>\n<p>Their personality differences are exhibited through their choice of majors too. DeJanee is a communication major while Meme is pursing art.</p>\n<p>“I can remember back to when they came to one of our camps. They had already committed and this was the first time really working them,” Galicinao said. “I think Dej was at third and Meme was at shortstop and [DeJanee] was on [Meme] about not talking enough. She was like, ‘You need to be talking loud enough. Coach Brie wants someone who’s loud.’ And [Meme] just looked at her and was like, ‘See how mean she is to me?’ It was funny.”</p>\n<p>These differences also translate onto the softball field. Meme will be found behind home plate as Santa Barbara’s catcher while DeJanee is listed as a utility player for UCSB, mostly playing different positions in the infield.</p>\n<p>DeJanee is known as a quicker player offensively, ranking second on the team in on-base percentage. She is often used as a designated hitter for the Gauchos as well.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Meme is more of a power-hitter, ranking second on the team in runs, third on team in hits and leading the team in doubles. This past week, Meme was named Big West Field Player of the Week after posting an .800 slugging percentage, .600 batting average and four runs in UCSB’s sweep over UC Riverside. She also hit 4-4 in Sunday’s game to clinch the series and move into a tie with Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“Meme is a more relaxed player,” DeJanee said. “She’s super calm and I’m a person that gets really nervous and anxious. We’re totally opposites, especially hitting.”</p>\n<p>While siblings who are on the same team have the potential to create drama, playing different positions has allowed the Moore sisters to avoid any rivalry.</p>\n<p>“I just remember the one time my child ball coach tried to make my sister a catcher,” Meme said. “I was like, ‘No. She can’t play my position.’”</p>\n<p>Playing the same position didn’t last long. DeJanee quickly returned to the infield, allowing the Moore sisters to support each other in a way only a sibling bond can. With such different personalities, DeJanee and Meme play off each other well. They know how to support and complement each other on the field.</p>\n<p>“We know each other the best, so when I tell her something, it’s because I know what she’s doing and I know I can help her,” DeJanee said. “That’s what I like about having my sister on the team. She knows me and she’s that person I can go to no matter what.”</p>\n<p>This weekend, UCSB has the opportunity to win a Big West Championship. Building off the Moore sisters’ energy and belief in each other might just give UCSB the edge it needs to take it all.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 7th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photos by Dustin Harris and Anna Kodelashvili of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/same-blood-same-team-opposite-personalities/","id":1068,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1067,1066,1065],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Sweep, Now Tied for First Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/softball2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/softball2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB moves into tie for first place after sweeping UC Riverside.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This past weekend could not have gone any better for the UCSB softball team.</p>\n<p>Going into the weekend, the Gauchos knew they needed a sweep to stay in contention for a Big West Championship.

So now that we’ve swept Riverside, we’re tied with Long Beach in first, so it’s pretty big.”</p>\n<p>After giving up 19 runs last weekend to Hawaii, Wisdom was back on her game. Wisdom gave up just four runs over the weekend, three earned, improving to 21-13 on the season. The win was the 62nd of her career, which ties Sandy Ortigies’ record set in 1987 for the most wins in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii is a really strong hitting team, so I expected them to score off of me, but this weekend I worked on keeping the ball low,” Wisdom said.</p>\n<p>In yesterday’s 5-3 victory to clinch the series, UCSB jumped out to a 5-1 lead. However, in the closest game of the series, Riverside wasn’t going to allow the Gauchos an easy victory.</p>\n<p>With one out in the seventh inning, junior shortstop Kris DeAnda doubled to score freshman right fielder Sommer Wilson and cut the deficit to two runs. UCR continued to rally, putting two runners in scoring position, but could not come up with the hit to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Sophomore catcher MeShalon “Meme” Moore anchored Santa Barbara offensively, hitting 4-4 with two runs and two RBI. Wisdom also scored two runs on 2-3 hitting.</p>\n<p>“We know we can hit the ball and string in hits and have a strong defense,” Wisdom said. “That helped us having a really good defense this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Game two of Saturday’s double header saw a 3-0 victory for UCSB as the entire team got involved offensively. Wisdom went 3-4 at the plate while senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil hit 2-3 with one run and one RBI. Senior first baseman Lauren Boser also went 1-2 with 2 RBI, and freshman left fielder Kristen Clark, who broke the single season hits record last weekend, hit 3-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB first got on the board in the third inning when Pilpil singled to score the eventual game-winning run. In the fifth, the Gauchos were able to get numerous runners on base due to Riverside sophomore pitcher Sophie Slagle walking batters. Three of her five walks came in this inning. With the bases loaded once again, Boser singled to center field, scoring two runners and clinching the game.</p>\n<p>Winning the first game 4-1, seven of 10 players in the Gauchos’ rotation got a hit and five had at least two hits as they outhit UCR 13-5.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important that all of us were hitting, moving runners and scoring them,” Wisdom said. “It helps a lot and helps us score more easily.”</p>\n<p>Unlike the final two games, the Highlanders got on the board first. Their best hitter, senior center fielder Dionne Anderson, singled and stole second before junior first baseman Karina Romero singled up the middle to score Anderson. During Saturday’s double header, Anderson was 4-5 with one run while Romero hit 4-6 with one RBI.</p>\n<p>The lead was short-lived, however, as UCSB evened the score in the second inning. Pilpil singled, Boser was hit by a pitch and freshman shortstop Emily Brucelas walked to load the bases. Then, freshman center fielder Stacy Cavazos was also hit by a pitch to score Pilpil.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos added two additional runs in the fourth and fifth innings before putting the Highlanders away in the sixth inning with a home run from Wisdom, her sixth of the year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final series of the season next weekend at home against Long Beach.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 4th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55145\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55145\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-05/gauchos-sweep-now-tied-for-first-place/","id":1067,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1066,1065,1064],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Goes For Sweep Against League’s Worst UC Riverside Hoping to Remain in Title Race","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-07.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_vsHawaii-DustinHarris-04272014-07.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos have won nine of their last 11 games.

If Cal Poly can steal a game or two and Santa Barbara can earn three wins, the Gauchos put their fate in their own hands for next weekend.</p>\n<p>“We know our goal is to sweep this weekend,” junior utility DeJanee Moore said. “We know this is a very big series, especially since Long Beach is still number one. It’s very important to sweep because our goal for this entire year was a Big West Championship and we know sweeping puts us in a good position to be Big West Champions this year.”</p>\n<p>Of course, UCSB will have to go through Riverside first. The Gauchos are currently 30-18 overall and 10-5 in the Big West while the Highlanders travel south with a 22-26 overall and 3-12 conference mark. UCR has dropped five of its last six games while Santa Barbara has won nine of its last 11.</p>\n<p>“We just need to stay within striking distance until that last weekend (when UCSB plays LBSU),” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “[It’s] one game at a time because Riverside has taken some games from teams and that’s what’s exciting about the Big West. Nothing is a gimme at all.”</p>\n<p>After a series victory against a Hawaii team that UCSB has struggled with in the past, the Gauchos have plenty of momentum moving forward. The series featured three high-scoring games, two of which went into extra innings. In 34 innings against the Rainbow Wahine, Santa Barbara put 23 runs on the board.</p>\n<p>“We really proved that we can perform in pressure situations,” junior third baseman Jenessa Jeppesen said. “That’s going to make everyone push a little harder, work a little harder for this weekend and allow us to be more confident.”</p>\n<p>Freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark helped UCSB to victory in Sunday’s rubber game, hitting 4-4 at the plate. In doing so, she set the single season hitting record with 76 on the year. Clark currently ranks first in the Big West in hits with the second-best player over 10 hits lower at 65.</p>\n<p>“[Clark is] a great player,” Moore said. “In the lead-off position, she’s there to start rallies. Her speed allows us to stay in the game even when people think we’re out of the game. She’ll get that base hit and all you need is a base hit to start a rally, so she’s been a really important aspect to the team this year.”</p>\n<p>Riverside ranks in the lower half of nearly every statistical category both offensively and defensively. However, in their last nine games, the Highlanders are 3-0 when scoring six or more runs. All losses have come in lower-scoring games.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UCR’s biggest offensive threat is senior centerfielder Dionne Anderson. Anderson ranks fifth in the Big West in runs with 33, seventh in hits with 53, sixth in batting average at .379 and third in on-base percentage at .503.</p>\n<p>“Any team can come out and have a really great day and any great team can come out and have a bad day,” Jeppesen said. “It’s all about keeping our pitches where they need to be and having solid defense. We have to know how to pitch to them and play our defense. They’re all really strong runners, so we have to be on our toes on defense.”</p>\n<p>Trying to keep the score low and guarantee the Gauchos their fifth consecutive series victory is junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Currently 18-13 on the season, Wisdom has pitched the most innings in the Big West. Earning her 18th win last weekend, she passed her season win total from last season.</p>\n<p>Wisdom ranks seventh in the league in ERA at 3.38. Meanwhile, Riverside also has a solid pitcher in junior Alyssa Razo, who sits one spot above Wisdom with her 3.25 ERA.</p>\n<p>“Their pitching is not as fast as what we saw [last] weekend,” Jeppesen said. “We really have to be patient and work the count, but we have a lot of really disciplined hitters on the team. Hopefully, it’ll go in our favor.”</p>\n<p>First pitch in Saturday’s doubleheader is set for noon at Amy S. Harrison field. The series finale will take place Sunday at noon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 1st’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by</em> <em>Dustin Harris of The Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55112\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55112\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/ucsb-goes-for-sweep-against-leagues-worst-uc-riverside-hoping-to-remain-in-title-race/","id":1062,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1061,1060,1059],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Rubber Match Against Hawaii to Take Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SoftballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SoftballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB remains in second place in the Big West standings with two victories over Hawaii this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After splitting two high-scoring games that both went into extra innings Saturday, the UCSB softball team needed a victory in Sunday’s rubber game against Hawaii to stay in contention for a Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>Rallying behind their freshmen, the Gauchos came away with the 6-4 win, clinching the series at home.</p>\n<p>The first-years combined for five of the six RBI for Santa Barbara and half of the team’s runs total.

Although Hawaii made a comeback, scoring one run in the seventh, a double play from Santa Barbara ended the game.</p>\n<p>“We got on a roll and the ball looked super big,” Clark said. “They just couldn’t catch us. Everyone was finding a hole.”</p>\n<p>With the series victory, UCSB improves to 30-18 overall and 10-5 in the Big West, just three games behind first-place Long Beach State. Hawaii dropped to 20-24 overall and 5-10 in conference.</p>\n<p>“[The series win] keeps us in the hunt. We’re taking care of what we need to without having to rely on other people,” Galicinao said. “We just need to stay within striking distance until that last weekend [when UCSB plays LBSU].”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s doubleheader featured two nail-biters as the two teams combined 34 runs in 17 innings of play.</p>\n<p>Game two swung the Rainbow Wahine’s way. Earning the 9-8 victory in nine innings of play, Hawaii jumped out to a 6-2 lead in the fourth. After adding two more runs in the seventh, the Gauchos needed an incredible seventh inning. Santa Barbara delivered, playing small ball and moving runners with six singles to score six runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>However, the effort would fall short as junior first baseman Leisha Li’ili’i hit a home run to even the series at 1-1. It was her second homer of the game. Li’ili’i ranks second in the Big West in homers with her total now at 14 on the year.</p>\n<p>Hawaii, the team that leads the league in home runs during conference play, improved to 12-4 when they hit two or more home runs.</p>\n<p>“The heart lineup that had been hitting home runs came up in the seventh,” Galicinao said. “I’ve been a little hard on [junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom] this weekend because she’s had better days than she’s shown this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing both games on Saturday at Hawaii’s tempo, Santa Barbara was able to edge out the Rainbow Wahine in a high-scoring battle in game one, winning 9-8 in eight innings.</p>\n<p>The offensive battle featured a close, see-saw game the entire way, but UCSB once again had to come back from behind in the seventh. Down two runs with one runner on base and two outs, Brucelas hit a home run to left center field, her fifth of the season.</p>\n<p>Going into the eighth, Hawaii’s freshman centerfielder Lindsey Willmon scored on a home run, but the Gauchos answered right back. Wisdom singled before sophomore catcher MeShalon Moore homered to left field to take the series opener. It was Moore’s first home run of the year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-win-rubber-match-against-hawaii-to-take-series/","id":1061,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1060,1059,1058],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hot Gaucho Squad Seeks Revenge Against Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/softball2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/softball2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB tries to make up ground on first-place Long Beach State.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the past, the UCSB softball team has been dominated by Hawaii, losing the all-time series 17-43.

The Rainbow Wahine, who won the Big West last year, have lost seven consecutive games.</p>\n<p>“We definitely think we’re going to come back and get the win and redeem ourselves from last year,” junior infielder Jenessa Jeppesen said. “It would be a huge win for us because they’ve always been a top competitor for us. With the lineup we have this year, I think we can finally take a series with them.”</p>\n<p>While not a particularly strong offensive team, Hawaii knows how to hit the long ball and wants to see high-scoring games. Hawaii ranks second in the Big West in home runs with 47 on the season, including a league-leading 12 during conference play.</p>\n<p>This season, Hawaii lives and dies by the home run, going 2-13 when hit it hits zero home runs and 11-3 when the team hits two or more home runs. If the Rainbow Wahine can put six or more runs on the board, they are nearly unbeatable at 16-1 this year.</p>\n<p>Hawaii’s biggest target offensively is Leisha Li’ili’i. The junior first baseman ranks second in the conference in homers with 12 on the season. As a result, she is also tied for second in walks. Li’ili’i’s .514 on base percentage and slugging percentage during league play of .875 also place second in conference.</p>\n<p>“Hawaii’s always had really strong hitters, so we have to know what pitches to pitch to them,” Jeppesen said.</p>\n<p>Defensively, Hawaii doesn’t serve as a threat, owning the worst ERA in the league. In fact, the team’s best pitcher holds an ERA of 4.07. The Rainbow Wahine also give up the most runs.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, for UCSB, junior pitcher Shleby Wisdom will try to control Hawaii’s offense and keep the score low. During the Gauchos’ winning streak the past eight games, Wisdom has pitched every inning. Last weekend at UC Davis, she improved to 16-12 on the year.</p>\n<p>Wisdom’s ERA of 3.14 ranks fifth in league. In addition, Santa Barbara holds the second spot in the conference in strikeout-to-walk ratio at 1.6.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to keep the ball low and keep spinning it,” Wisdom said. “I just have to trust my defense and keep it on the field and we’ll be good.”</p>\n<p>First pitch is set for noon on Saturday at Campus Diamond.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 24th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-24/hot-gaucho-squad-seeks-revenge-against-hawaii/","id":1060,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1059,1058,1057],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Two of Three in Series at UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_vsCSUB-DustinHarris-02092014-04-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_vsCSUB-DustinHarris-02092014-04-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB continued its recent run of success, taking two out of three from UC Davis while winning seven of the last eight games.

Junior right fielder DeJanee Moore led the team, hitting 2-3 with two runs and two RBI.</p>\n<p>Davis also aided Santa Barbara by committing four errors.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, game one put the Gauchos in a hole to start the series as UCSB fell 5-2.</p>\n<p>While UCSB scored first, putting one run each in the first and third innings, the Aggies could not be held down in the fourth as the worst offensive team in the Big West scored all five of its runs in the inning.</p>\n<p>The first two batters up for Davis each homered to tie the game at two. Then, with the bases loaded, sophomore shortstop Christa Castello tripled to score the winning runs for the struggling Aggies.</p>\n<p>UCSB had opportunities to earn the series sweep in the fifth and sixth innings, but could not find the winning hit, leaving two runners on base in each inning.</p>\n<p>Despite sophomore catcher MeShalon Moore’s effort, being involved in every run for Santa Barbara hitting 2-3 with two RBI, the rest of the team could muster up just one run.</p>\n<p>For UCD, sophomore designated hitter Kelly Zboralske did her job, hitting 2-3 with two RBI in her team’s win. Overall on Friday, Zboralske tallied one run and three RBI on 4-6 hitting.</p>\n<p>After spending the last two weekends on the road, the Gauchos return home to Campus Diamond next weekend for a three-game series against Hawaii.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54916\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54916\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/ucsb-wins-two-of-three-in-series-at-uc-davis/","id":1059,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1058,1057,1056],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faces Struggling UC Davis in Weekend Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/4.6.14UCSBSoftballvCalPoly-11_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/4.6.14UCSBSoftballvCalPoly-11_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will look to expand upon its five-game win streak with a three-game series at UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On paper, this weekend’s series should be an easy one for the UCSB softball team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos make the long road trip north to face a UC Davis team that has struggled all year at 14-25 overall and 3-6 in the Big West.

Davis’ best pitcher is freshman Andrea Reynolds, who ranks seventh in conference in ERA at 3.25, just one spot behind Wisdom.</p>\n<p>“It’s the Big West Conference and our coach always tells us that the Big West is a roller coaster,” Wisdom said. “Teams have great days and then will have their worst days. Whatever day they bring us, we’ll have our best day.”</p>\n<p>Reynolds will face a Gaucho team that loves to score frequently. Led by senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil, UCSB tallied 22 runs last weekend. Pilpil couldn’t be stopped offensively, recording four doubles, five runs and three RBI on 6-10 hitting. Her effort led to Big West Field Player of the Week honors earlier this week.</p>\n<p>“[Pilpil] did really well defensively and offensively,” Wisdom said. “The whole team played well. Once we put the bat to the ball and started hitting holes, it got contagious and we couldn’t stop hitting.”</p>\n<p>Along with freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark, the duo rank among the top seven in the Big West in runs. Clark also leads the Big West in hits with 67, nine more than the second-ranked player.</p>\n<p>Wisdom will also be a key player this weekend as she also leads the team in RBI with 26 and is tied for most home runs on the season with five, but also is the lead pitcher for UCSB. Last weekend she pitched every inning in the sweep, earning three wins to increase her record to 13-10.</p>\n<p>“It’s the same focus as last weekend — getting our bunts down, moving runners and playing strong defense,” Wisdom said.</p>\n<p>The series will begin tomorrow with a double-header and conclude Saturday. First pitch Friday is set for 1 p.m. at La Rue Field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 17, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54882\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/ucsb-faces-struggling-uc-davis-in-weekend-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54882\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/ucsb-faces-struggling-uc-davis-in-weekend-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/ucsb-faces-struggling-uc-davis-in-weekend-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/ucsb-faces-struggling-uc-davis-in-weekend-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/ucsb-faces-struggling-uc-davis-in-weekend-series/","id":1058,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1057,1056,1055],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Earn First Big West Series Sweep","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SoftballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SoftballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=865%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB scored 22 runs in the series sweep over CSUN.

The Gauchos held freshman first baseman Taylor Glover, the Matadors’ top hitter, to 2-11 hitting on the weekend. Keeping her at bay was junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom, who pitched all 21 innings, improving to 14-11 on the year.</p>\n<p>In game three yesterday, Santa Barbara took a 6-2 victory to clinch the series. Unlike in the two games Saturday, Northridge got on the board first, scoring two runs in the first inning. However, Wisdom shut down the Matadors’ offense the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ first score came in the fourth inning. With two Gauchos on base, freshman centerfielder Stacy Cavazos hit a home run to left field, her fifth of the season, to give UCSB its first lead of the game.</p>\n<p>Then, in the seventh, a double by senior first baseman Lauren Boser and a single by freshman shortstop Emily Brucelas each brought home a run. Finally, an error by the Matadors gave Santa Barbara its third score of the day and a comfortable 6-2 lead.</p>\n<p>Both games on Saturday saw the Gauchos start the game strong. They never let up, hitting seven doubles and 16 runs in the two games combined.</p>\n<p>In the second game of the doubleheader, UCSB went up 7-0 in the third inning before Northridge could cross home plate. The hole would be too deep for the Matadors as Santa Barbara cruised to an 8-3 victory.</p>\n<p>Freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark hit 2-3 with two runs while Wisdom contributed a run on a perfect 3-3 hitting performance.</p>\n<p>Similar to game two, UCSB scored four runs in the first inning as Northridge committed two errors. Northridge responded, tacking two runs on the board in the second, but UCSB showed its resiliency, crossing home plate three times in the third.</p>\n<p>Northridge made its run in the final innings and the scoreboard reading 8-5.
