These barricades, made of chairs, wires and cones, are the only protection they have from the riot police. As I walk past them to get to my hall, a student protester dressed in all black turns to me and says, “Stay safe.” I respond with a mere, “You too.” As the police become more violent, I know he’ll need it more than me.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91563\" style=\"width: 458px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91563\" data-attachment-id=\"91563\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/hong-kong-protests/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hong-kong-protests-e1574716335580.png?fit=650%2C793&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,793\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hong kong protests\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hong-kong-protests-e1574716335580.png?fit=205%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hong-kong-protests-e1574716335580.png?fit=840%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-91563 \" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hong-kong-protests-e1574716335580.png?resize=448%2C547\" alt=\"\" width=\"448\" height=\"547\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-91563\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Nov. 14, the University of Hong Kong announced that it will be halting all on-campus classes and switching to online classes instead due to ongoing violence between police and protesters.

There were no objects being thrown at the police when the first round of tear gas was fired. It was only after the police released this first round that the protesters threw Molotov cocktails and petrol bombs between themselves and the police as a line of defense.  Throughout the night, the police forces beat, shot and arrested over 100 students. The Hong Kong Free Press reported that, in multiple videos, the riot police could be heard saying “beat the head” as they attacked protesters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fight for freedom is often violent and chaotic, but let’s be clear: in this case, the government and the police incited and continue to provoke the chaos. Since June, the government has </span><a href=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/hong-kong/article/3032146/hong-kong-protests/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arrested over 4,000 protesters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of ages ranging from 11 to 83. Currently, the riot police are laying siege on the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, trapping hundreds of students inside the campus. When the government abuses its powers to such an extent, there is no option other than to retaliate. To not react at all is to allow these injustices to prevail. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hong Kong that I have come to love is one where office workers march peacefully during their lunch break, teachers are concerned for their students’ futures and students are currently fighting for their rights. The Hong Kong I know is resilient and kind; it is a thousand-person crowd parting for an ambulance to get through, the candlelight vigils for the injured and the volunteer-run canteen that allows protesters to eat for free. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Hong Kong government has been abusing its powers, using excessive force and villainizing the protesters through propaganda. We cannot let this go unnoticed. We are privileged to live in a country that allows us to voice our opinions in public and gives us access to unbiased news sources. I urge you all to use that right to read the news, pay attention and stand with the people of Hong Kong as they continue to fight for the rights and freedoms that we take for granted every day.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emma Xing thinks that if we value our rights so much, we should stand with others when they fight for theirs.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91562\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91562\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-26/stand-with-hong-kong/","id":5656,"author":{"id":830,"name":"Emma Xing"},"related":[5655,5654,5653],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/830"}},"__N_SSG":true}
