Designed for upper-division undergraduate students, the apartments will include three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a dining area and a living room. The complexes will also have study and recreation rooms, a small convenience store and a new dining commons. Additionally, on-site amenities will be provided to residents, including a playing field, basketball courts, sand volleyball courts and access to the existing swimming pool at Santa Catalina Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>According to Julie Levangie, Multimedia Communications and Marketing Coordinator, the project will provide new housing for approximately 1,000 students, as well as four new residences for faculty members in the Faculty-in-Residence Program and renovations to the Portola Dining Commons inside Santa Catalina Residence Hall.</p>\n<p>“We are very excited that the San Joaquin Apartments and Portola Dining Commons project has been approved by the Coastal Commission,” Levangie said. “This supports the terms of the recently approved Long Range Development Plan and its call for an increase in student housing.”</p>\n<p>Levangie said the project will meet the high standards of sustainability and environmental regulation associated with the university.</p>\n<p>“Housing and Residential Services strives to be good stewards of the environment and supporting UCSB on its way to becoming a sustainable community,” Levangie said. “The project has several sustainable design measures including storm water retention basin, energy efficient windows, and energy-star appliances for all kitchens.”</p>\n<p>According to Senior Associate Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher, the efforts to make San Joaquin Village sustainable will also include water and energy efficiency and reduced vehicle use on campus through an additional 24 Express bus line established in cooperation with the Metropolitan Transit Authority.</p>\n<p>“We will be using reclaimed water extensively, using the most up-to-date lighting technology, and naturally ventilating all of the living spaces,” Fisher said. “The project works to improve pedestrian and bicycle circulation in and around the site including street improvements on Storke and El Colegio Roads.”</p>\n<p>Fisher also said the San Joaquin Village’s building style will center around a theme of modern architecture and landscaping.</p>\n<p>“This will be a project with excellent architecture and a beautiful landscape of courtyards and paseos,” Fisher said. “The buildings are quite modern. This is a very exciting project in terms of its architecture and landscape.”</p>\n<p>According to Levangie, while the new university housing is roughly a mile from campus, she does not believe commuting will be a problem for residents.</p>\n<p>“As far as distance, residents will be a short 10 minute off-street bike ride from the middle of campus or a five minute bus ride to campus,” Levangie said.<br>\nFisher said he hopes the new apartments will encourage students to remain within university housing systems.</p>\n<p>“We believe this housing will provide students with a desirable alternative to apartments in Isla Vista,” Fisher said. “We hope that more students will choose to stay in on-campus housing during all of their years on our campus.”</p>\n<p>Allie Davidson, second-year biology major and residential assistant at Santa Rosa Hall, said the San Joaquin Village will help improve the housing situation for students on campus in light of increasing enrollment.</p>\n<p>“With capacity for 1,000 residents, the San Joaquin apartments will certainly aid with current overcrowding of residence halls,” Davidson said. “I think the installment of these new resident apartments will have a positive impact on the students at UCSB, provided Housing and Residential Services continue their efforts in energy-saving and environmentally efficient machinery, lights and facilities.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The film profiled nine female activists sharing their own personal experiences. Two Muslim Women’s Rights Activists, Raheel Raza and Jasvinder Sanghera, were featured in the film and spoke at the event, encouraging audience members to become involved issues involving abuse in honor-based societies.</p>\n<p>Author of the book<em> Their Jihad . . . Not My Jihad!</em> and President of the Council for Muslims Facing Tomorrow, Raza said “Honor Diaries”  is designed to motivate victims of oppression to speak out about their experiences of abuse.</p>\n<p>“This is not just a documentary, it is a call for action,” Raza said. “Our purpose is to expose, educate and empower victims of women oppression.”</p>\n<p>According to Raza, giving college students and young adults the opportunity to learn about the oppression of women in honor-based cultures is essential to fighting gender inequality.</p>\n<p>“The youth are the next generation,” Raza said. “They are the future and they need to know the problems that they are going to come up against. We love talking to young people because they have so many questions. I hope they learn something new and I hope that the statistics will shock them into an awareness about what is happening around them.”</p>\n<p>Sigma Theta Psi president and fourth-year psychology major Brenda Santamaria said she hopes that students in attendance were educated by the event and were reminded that “we as women, as humans, should be caring for everyone equally.”</p>\n<p>“I hope that they learned that women around the world face issues that maybe here in the United States aren’t issues,” Santamaria said. “It’s really important to appreciate what we are offered and what other people are not.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Autumn LaTour said after viewing the “Honor Diaries” documentary and hearing Raza and Sanghera speak, she plans to become further involved in the fight for equality for women.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really meaningful to everybody, and not just women, in our society, to become involved in these issues and make sure these issues are talked about and incorporated to promote equality for women,” LaTour said. “I’m planning on becoming an “Honor Diaries” ambassador because most people aren’t aware of these issues.”</p>\n<p>According to Raza, educating students about oppression in honor-based societies is the first step toward promoting change to help “eradicate the problem” of abuse and that social progress depends on individual actions.</p>\n<p>“Unless you speak out,” Raza said. “There won’t be change.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58410\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58410\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/screening-inspires-students-to-address-gender-inequality/","id":2953,"author":{"id":172,"name":"Teddy Krolczyk"},"related":[2952,2951,2950],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/172"}},"__N_SSG":true}
