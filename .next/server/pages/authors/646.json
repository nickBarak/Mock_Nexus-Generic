</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you find yourself wanting to stay home on a Saturday night, watching “She’s the Man,” with a furry friend under one arm and a pint of Rite Aid vanilla ice cream under the other? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have answered yes to any of these questions, you may have been infected by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxoplasma gondii</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a parasite that infects its host with an irrational attraction toward feline species. Below is a  comprehensive diagnostic test, created by the Center for Disease Control (you know, the one that saved us from Ebola), that establishes whether or not you have been infected. The test is simple. Read the three paragraphs below. Once completed, find the nearest cat and objectively observe your response. If your response is positive, you are diseased. Seek medical attention immediately. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>Toxoplasma gondii</i></b><b> Test: Version C</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>They feed off of your resources: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, cats are the fuckboys of domestic animals. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are the Chad that does everything in his power to fuck Rebecca, and once he reaches his goal, he avoids Rebecca like she is a common CALPIRG solicitor. And even though Rebecca gets nothing out of this, she still, for some unknown reason, wants nothing more than for Chad to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">love</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> acknowledge her. The only time cats even acknowledge that you are a living, feeling creature, is when they are trying to get something from you, like food. And once they get what they want, they’ll ghost you for a little bit, as they have no interest in building any real relationship. They’ll only hit you up once they get hungry again by nestling their head against yours, the equivalent of Chad sending Rebecca a 3 a.m. “U up” text. They rub their scent all over you, marking you as their territory, basically telling other animals to back up. This sheer and immature jealousy denatures you into a piece of property. You are a flunky minion. Don’t let your cat, an animal that pisses in a bucket, own you.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>They spread parasites:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Cats host the parasite </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxoplasma gondii </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in their reproductive tracts, happily giving the parasite a warm and stable home, providing it a perfect destination for the parasite to reproduce and spread. Cats then shit the parasite out so the parasite can weasel its way into the brains of small animals, slowing their reaction time and attracting these helpless snacks to the smell of disgusting, acidic, cat piss. Cats lure these small animals out of hiding, only to brutally and savagely murder them with their retractable claws. Oh, but don’t feel left out, the parasite is not only for small animals. No, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">T. gondii</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> parasite affects more than 30 percent of humans. So, if you have ever found yourself wondering why people shit on cats endlessly, you have most likely been infected. Some advice: check yourself before you wreck yourself. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>They eat you:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Just like any other parasite, cats actually feed off of humans. No joke, in 2008, a Romanian cat ate her owner’s corpse after she passed away in her home. According to “postmodern predation,” cats are all psychotic mommy and daddy eaters that eat their owner’s dead body after they die. It does not matter to cats that you were an amazing owner. They will still attack your lifeless flesh, focusing on your lips and nose, robbing you of the ability to have an open casket funeral. Cats literally eat humans, reducing us to something less than human, food. They also prey on smaller, innocent creatures, for shear joy, like bloodthirsty psychopaths. Every year, cats kill 20.7 billion smaller animals and are responsible for the extinction of 33 species. One-third of their typical day is spent hunting and killing these defenseless creatures. It is not that they need to kill smaller animals for food. Oh no, they kill just to kill, like genocidal brutes. They take home the carcasses of their kills like souvenirs, giving validity to their reputation as the “friendly neighborhood serial killer.” </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have reached the end of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toxoplasma gondii</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Test. Now, find the nearest cat and objectively record your response. If you are repulsed by their parasitic, ungrateful nature, congrats. You are sane and healthy. If you still feel an attraction to them, then there is a 100 percent chance you are diseased. Seek treatment immediately, before you end up buying a cat, which is exactly how the spread of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">T. gondii </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">parasite is perpetuated. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, you do not like cats because they are lovable, you only like the ungrateful social parasites because you are infected. It is no coincidence that cats are designated as the heartless sidekicks of wicked witches. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Horsley is a labrador owner, yet based

own education and its downfalls. I realized that while high schools fail to provide an adequate foundation for sexual education, universities do little to fix the damage. I contemplated what my high school did wrong and asked myself: what should UCSB  do to ensure that its students receive a comprehensive sexual health education?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I attended an incredibly liberal private high school in the heart of Silicon Valley. While the school excelled in many ways and prepared us to succeed academically, they failed to prepare us for living as individuals in society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our required sex ed class took place during freshman year. It was a quarter long class that met  once a week for fifty minutes. Because of its bland and unengaged delivery, its lack of both general information and specifics and its decision not to hold us accountable for retaining the material, it was clear this would be a slack-off class. My fellow 14 and 15 year old classmates either used the class to frantically study for upcoming tests, zone out and take a much needed mental break, or hang out with friends and make crude jokes.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a lot of classes that we had to suffer through in school that were beyond boring. Even in classes with lifeless, passionless teachers, we were forced to be engaged. We were constantly cold-called, tested and asked to turn in assignments that prove our understanding. Zoning out, talking and working on material or studying for another class was actively prohibited. However, all of these actions were rampant in our sex ed course. So why was this all allowed to take place? Why were the sex ed class standards so different?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it’s pretty clear. My school did not emphasize its importance as much as other subjects we studied. Literally every single class that students were required to take had some sort of testing system to ensure that students were actually learning the material. That is, every class except for sex ed.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our sex ed course never addressed Plan B or even abortions, which promotes students to turn to other sources of information that may or may not be accurate.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew the class was a joke, but it wasn’t until the beginning of my senior year that I realized how pathetic it really was. During my free period, my friend told a group of us that she finally got an IUD. She was super happy about it and recommended it to all of us. She said that, besides its obvious use to protect against pregnancy, it basically stopped her period and cleared her skin. The two girls I was sitting with responded by asking, “wait, what’s an IUD?” They were unaware of other contraceptives besides condoms and birth control pills, so they resorted to birth control — despite the negative physical reactions. Because their knowledge of contraceptives, like various IUDs or the NuvaRing, was sparse, the girls relied on their peers for sexual health information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The girls peppered the IUD-bearer with a multitude of questions, reinforcing the nationwide trend of teens relying on other teens and the media to educate themselves and make up for their lack of a formal sexual education. This kind of behavior stems from poor education and leads to false rumors and facts. One example of these harmful rumors is Plan B does not work after you’ve taken it three times. Our sex ed course never addressed Plan B or even abortions, which promotes students to turn to other sources of information that may or may not be accurate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I got to college, I was shocked at the pure illiteracy of some of my peers when it came to basic sexual health and anatomy. I came to this realization during a conversation that took place in DLG at the beginning of my freshman year. My friend mentioned that her boyfriend had just gotten tested and that we should get tested, just to make sure. One girl stated that she didn’t need to get tested because she would be able to tell if she had one. What she did not understand is that many STIs are often asymptomatic. Another girl responded that she did not need to get tested because she only blows people. What she and many others fail to understand is that STIs can be transmitted through oral sex, even if you spit, and through pre-ejaculate via oral or vaginal sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the surface, their comments may just seem like pure ignorance or stupidity, but, when assessing the potential consequences of their actions or lack of actions, it reflects a public health concern. These girls’ lack of education is a reason why STIs are spreading. Even though we are in a time of incredibly modernized medicine, Chlamydia and Gonorrhea infections are at a record high. In fact, Chlamydia accounts for the highest number of annual cases of any condition ever reported to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC states that, “one in two sexually active persons will contract an STI by age 25.” Why is this? Well, only about 12% of young people were tested in the last year (CDC), so people continue to spread them through unprotected oral, vaginal, and anal sex. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STIs are not just a nuisance. They have lasting effects with grave consequences. New strains of STIs emerge every year that are becoming harder and harder to treat. The CDC estimates that, “nearly 20 million new STIs occur every year in this country”. One recent infection that has garnered attention is Antibiotic Resistant Gonorrhea. This strain is resistant to our current antibiotics, making it much harder to treat — sometimes impossible.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex ed is important. It is a fundamental topic in human education and it helps to strengthen public health.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it important that you treat STIs? Well, they can result in serious damage with lasting effects later in life. For instance, the CDC estimates that “undiagnosed STIs cause 24,000 women to become infertile each year.” Women are potentially made infertile if Chlamydia evolves into Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, which is often a sign of carelessness as a result of a poor education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be fair, there are a lot of great resources and information that UCSB provides to its students surrounding sexual health. However, most students are not taking advantage of these resources, even when they are in need of educating. So, what should UCSB be doing for its students to ensure that we all receive an acceptable sexual education?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thought is to have a required online course, similar to that of sexual assault and drug and alcohol education course. However, the issue with these courses is that they are easy to skip through which makes it rather easy to not actually learn any of the information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another idea would be to make it a GE requirement to take a course similar to the Baldwins’ highly regarded Sociology of Human Sexuality course. The course covers topics such as abortion, birth control, emergency contraception, Planned Parenthood, STIs, domestic violence, and UCSB sex culture and statistics. It is not only one of the longest running classes taught in the history of UCSB, it is one of the most popular. The popularity of this class and the increase in STI testing directly after the STI lecture reveals that students are not only uninformed, but they also want to gain a better understanding of the subject. Requiring students to take this class, or a class with similar content, would serve the student body well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex ed is important. It is a fundamental topic in human education and it helps to strengthen public health. It should be more heavily integrated into university curriculums because college is meant not only to give degrees, but to prepare us for the future as informed citizens of the world.</span></p>\n<p><em>Claire Horsley wants to ensure that Gauchos are as educated in the bedroom as they are in the classroom.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81396\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81396\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-21/sex-education-is-failing-american-students/","id":6293,"author":{"id":646,"name":"Claire Horsley"},"related":[6292,6291,6290],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/646"}},"__N_SSG":true}
