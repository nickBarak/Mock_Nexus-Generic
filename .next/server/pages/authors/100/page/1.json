Each campaign lasts two years. As a result, each year typically sees one returning campaign and one newly elected one.</p>\n<p>This year, however, UCSA will support three campaigns due to a tie in votes between UCSOS and reIGNITE, UC Santa Barbara representative on the UCSA Board of Directors Kristin Hsu said. These campaigns were selected by the UCSA Board of Directors, which is composed of student representatives from the different UC campuses.</p>\n<p>“By selecting them as UCSA campaigns, UC students are committed to increasing awareness and seeking solutions that can address these issues,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>We Are 3D, the newly-elected campaign, will advocate for an increase in resource allocation for disabled, chronically ill and neurodivergent UC students. The campaign is currently advocating for a free 24-hour transportation service, increased accessibility to classrooms and health insurance for pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p>The UCSOS campaign will address the widespread food and housing insecurity prevalent amongst UC students. The campaign organizers are currently attempting to coordinate a UC hunger and homelessness week and hope to establish a standard of living for students at a UCSA meeting with UC President Janet Napolitano in two weeks.</p>\n<p>reIGNITE focuses on the same issues addressed by the 2013-2015 I.G.N.I.T.E. campaign, which discussed the school-to-prison pipeline, issues of diversity on UC campuses and UC campus climate.</p>\n<p>According to Nushi Yapabandara, a fourth-year philosophy major and reIGNITE cofounder and campaign coordinator at UCSB, a total of $6,000 from UC student fees is allocated for the campaigns, though the funds are not necessarily distributed evenly among the three campaigns.</p>\n<p>This is the UCSOS campaign’s last year, while UCSA is solidifying reIGNITE as a permanent campaign renamed as permIGNITE.</p>\n<p>“Many of the system-wide issues that students organize around cannot be fixed in one to two years but it is extremely important that we do what we can with the time we have,” Hsu said.</p>\n<p>Yapabandara said she worked to bring a resolution to UCSA asking to make permIGNITE a permanent campaign to carry out the campaign’s long-term goals.</p>\n<p>Daniel Nagey, UC Davis’s undergraduate representative for the UCSA Board of Directors, explained that the reIGNITE campaign plans to work towards affirmative action, establishing a UC-wide UC Police Department oversight committee and a student bill of rights at a university-wide level.</p>\n<p>The board also plans to engage in local, low-income community outreach, recruitment retention spaces and prison divestment awareness.</p>\n<p>Nagey said the two UCSA campaigns had “pretty low” success rates last year, which he attributes to the November elections. He said he believes last year’s political climate made UC student governments and the UCSA board feel hopeless, but said he was optimistic for this year’s campaigns.</p>\n<p>“This situation obviously still is bad, but the shock is not there,” Nagey said.  “I’m hoping that we can push through and get these demands met within the year.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Nushi Yapabandara is a fourth-year philosophy major, not a third-year, as previously reported. </em></p>\n<p><em>The article was also corrected to show that the reIGNITE campaign is already a permanent campaign. Yapabandara worked to bring a resolution to UCSA to make permIGNITE a permanent campaign. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page three of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/ucsa-launches-3-campaigns-for-2017-18-school-year/","id":3589,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[3588,3587,3586],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Recap: Off-Campus Senator Candidate Forum","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tuesday-Debates-by-Josh-Ortiz-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tuesday-Debates-by-Josh-Ortiz-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The candidates for off-campus senator kicked off the second day of campaigning on Tuesday, meeting at the candidate forum in The Hub to relay their stances on various issues as potential senators.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The candidates for off-campus senator kicked off the second day of campaigning on Tuesday, meeting at the candidate forum in The Hub to relay their stances on various issues as potential senators.</p>\n<p>Taking part in the off-campus senator forum were five Isla Vista Party candidates — Brandon Mora, Sami Kaayal, Veronica Leeman, Alexandra Gessesse and Ilene Ochoa — and six Campus United candidates — Kristen Armellini, Adham Btaddini, Deepika Chandrashekar, Sophia Dycaico, Sam Cook and Dominick DiCesare.</p>\n<p>Campus United candidates for off-campus senator — Alison Sir, Adnan Mansur, Anthony Pimentel, Evan Quash and Dhishal Jayasinghe — participated in the forum with the collegiate senator candidates due to an Elections Board scheduling mishap.</p>\n<p>Candidates Carla Martinez, Siboney Arias, Mara Joy Abubo and Justin Deckard did not show for Tuesday’s forum.</p>\n<p>Each candidate was given one minute to introduce themselves and their party position. Steven Kwok, the forum moderator, posed two questions for candidate response, allotting one minute each. The candidates were allocated 30 seconds for final remarks.</p>\n<p>Kwok first asked the candidates how they would ensure that the LGBTQ community on campus feels safe and recognized. The second question addressed the role the university should play regarding Deltopia.</p>\n<p>Responses to the issues presented by these questions and overarching goals were identified by each candidate as summarized below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ochoa, a third-year communication major, said she hoped for a greater presence for the LGBTQ community on campus. Regarding Deltopia, Ochoa said the successful community outreach done by UC Isla Vista (UCIV) this year was indicative of what the I.V. community should represent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Cook, a first-year political science major, said he understands the importance in providing a space for the LGBTQ community to share their voice. As vice president of Santa Catalina Hall Council, he said he has helped to created events for LGBTQ students in the hall. Cook said the UCIV program played a crucial role in Deltopia this year, and the university’s provision of the Warm Up concert was a great incentive as well, proving that “the University has truly come full circle on how they view Deltopia and it will only get better from here.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Mora, a third-year political science and sociology double major, said he would like to see the expansion of non-gendered bathrooms on campus so the LGBTQ community can be more included on campus. Mora said the university should ensure that the police presence in Isla Vista stays true to the approachable demeanor they held this year, rather than the more hostile demeanor Mora said the police assumed in prior years.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Gessesse, a first-year history of public policy and sociology double major, said she wants to expand the definition of safe spaces for the LGBTQ community on campus to include restrooms and bathrooms. Gessesse said she wants the university to work closely alongside the I.V. Community Services District (CSD) during Deltopia. According to Gessesse, “the university spent a lot of money on advertisements that could be geared towards partnership towards creating safety with I.V. CSD.”</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Btaddini, a second-year political science major, said he wants to “empower the students here that are making an effort to fight for the LGBTQ community and represent students on campus.” Regarding the university’s role during Deltopia, Btaddini said the university should foster the kind of culture that does not punish students on big events, but looks out for their safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Dycaico, a second-year history of public policy major, said if elected, she plans to reach out to LGBTQ communities to ensure they are heard and represented. She said the role the university plays in holding alternative events during Deltopia is an effective safety measure, especially when coupled with the help of UCIV.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DiCesare, a third-year computer science major, said he plans to use his platform “to bring different groups and ideologies on this campus together so we can have a better environment for this campus no matter who you are or what you identify as.” DiCesare said he believes students, as members of the university and as a part of the Isla Vista community, should all take steps during Deltopia to ensure that students are safe in all instances.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Leeman, a second-year mathematical science and German double major, said she wants to reach out to professors to ensure they are incorporating “inclusive language in their syllabi and lectures” for the LGBTQ community. Leeman said the university’s role during Deltopia should be more proactive and less reactive and focus on educating students about why it is in their best interest to protect Isla Vista.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Chandrashekar, a first-year communication major, said that if elected, she plans on making it a point to start a conversation with the LGBTQ community, go to their meetings and hear what their concerns are. She also said students should have a voice in regard to the university funding of precautionary advertisements against Deltopia and where that funding may be better spent.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Kaayal, a second-year biology major, said he hopes to promote as many safe spaces on campus for the LGBTQ community as possible. Concerning the university’s role during Deltopia, Kaayal said he hopes to promote the idea of community policing. He said he believes the university should increase the jurisdiction of CSOs instead of bringing police in from other areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Armellini, a second-year history of public policy major, said she wants to “amplify” the voices in the LGBTQ community and “make sure they’re heard and taken care of.” She said the University’s approach to Deltopia should involve providing students with education, events and communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Mansur, a third-year statistics major, said he wants to help students get jobs after graduation, and plans to make Career Services more accessible. He also wants to increase alumni connections with current students. If elected, he said he wants to help students know where their student fees are going.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Sir, a first-year political science major, said she wants to represent minority communities and increase visibility of student resources. If elected, Sir said she wants to expand the A.S. Food Bank to Isla Vista so students can have access to it when off campus.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Pimentel, a second-year political major, said he wants to help keep student fees affordable and facilitate student-run businesses. If elected, he said he wants to serve as the liaison between the student body and the university administration and use A.S. to empower students.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Quash, a first-year statistical science and black studies double major, said he wants to increase off-campus students’ representation. If elected, Quash said he plans to achieve his goals as a senator through maintaining an open dialogue between A.S. and the administration to address issues such as college affordability.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Jayasinghe, a second-year philosophy and global studies double major, said he wants to fix the biggest problems in Isla Vista including parking and work alongside the CSD. If elected, Jayasinghe said he hopes to use his experience of working in the External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) office to improve the community and open the dialogue to include all opinions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Campaigning for A.S. Elections began Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</p>\n<p>Profiles of all 51 A.S. candidates can be found <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2017/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77079\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77079\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-19/recap-off-campus-senator-candidate-forum/","id":2723,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[2722,2721,2720],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V. a Lucrative Market for Deliveries","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DSC_0143.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As a small town with a quirky, youthful populace, Isla Vista has needs that differ from its surrounding areas.

Students who understand its distinct culture are able to fulfill I.V.’s demands through various entrepreneurial pursuits.</p>\n<p>David Welsh and Michael Bakkie, two fourth-year economics majors at UCSB, saw a gap in supply and demand: Students needed a way to get groceries but didn’t have access to a car, and they had to rely on friends to go to a grocery store.</p>\n<p>They began developing the plan for their delivery model two years ago, culminating in the creation of Isla Vista Grocery Delivery, founded earlier this November.</p>\n<p>The alternative to making commutes to grocery stores, Welsh said, was either going to local, “overpriced” I.V. stores, eating at restaurants or getting a meal plan, all of which are more expensive than “reasonable eating.”</p>\n<p>The combination of students’ lack of options and mobility created a space for opportunists like Welsh and Bakkie to provide a solution.</p>\n<p>“I have always dreamed of being an entrepreneur, and this was a great way to start in a local market that I really know very well because I am one of these college students that would use this service,” Welsh said.</p>\n<p>The way Welsh sees it, a trip to the grocery store takes about an hour to complete: One has to drive there, drive back and buy everything. To a lot of people, he said, the effort needed to deal with that hassle is worth about $10.</p>\n<p>“If we can streamline that process and do it for a lot of students, that’s good business,” he said. “We really think this will save students’ time and money in the long run.”</p>\n<p>Welsh believes a lot of students will get behind “a startup started by other Gauchos.”</p>\n<p>This entrepreneurial ambition is also what drove fourth-year UCSB student Reese Hammerstrom to launch his own delivery service, D.I.V.E., during the fall of last year.</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom said he came up with the business idea during the previous summer playing “Isla Vista’s sport” beer die.</p>\n<p>“Our die would keep bouncing off the balcony into the ocean and we would have to stop playing the game,” he said. “I was thinking of ways for a service where I could essentially press a button and dice would appear at my door.”</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom said he bought playing dice from Amazon that summer, delivered dice for a few weeks and, come Fall Quarter, realized there was opportunity to expand.</p>\n<p>Hammerstrom was able to pinpoint what I.V. needed through direct interaction with local culture and consequently developed a business model. He called the model D.I.V.E., an acronym for Delivering Isla Vista Entertainment.</p>\n<p>Though Hammerstrom began by delivering supplies such as dice, lighters, ping-pong balls, cups and “chasers” to his friends, he “realized there was a bigger opportunity to expand beyond party supplies.”</p>\n<p>Last summer, he partnered with I.V. Market and now delivers party supplies, ice cream, drinks, munchies, house supplies and school supplies, “essentially anything a college student could need with the exception of cooked food,” he said.</p>\n<p>D.I.V.E.’s Vice President of Operations, Robert Holland, said the company is all about giving customers “complete control of their time.”</p>\n<p>“Isla Vistans live an active lifestyle, and going to the store can be kind of a drag,” Holland said. “D.I.V.E. takes care of your everyday shopping needs, and for the fun times, D.I.V.E.’s got your dice, limes and Sprite, too.”</p>\n<p>Currently, delivery has been centered around a concentrated demand for Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, specifically the flavor “Half Baked.”</p>\n<p>“I think that’s just a factor of the current hours of operation. Right now we’re only open from 7:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. every night. That time kind of lends itself to ice cream and party supplies,” Hammerstrom said.</p>\n<p>There has been a particular surge in customer activity coming from the dorms, Hammerstrom said.</p>\n<p>“It’s really great for freshmen,” he said, “Most people in their first year usually don’t have access to cars and to all these supplies and ice cream, and so freshman now are just pretty stoked about this service.”</p>\n<p>UCSB student Kaitlyn Hague said she believes the need for delivery came from high demand, a lack of mobility and “student laziness.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve needed ice and dice last minute for parties, but some nights I’m just binge-watching Netflix and I really want ice cream without getting out of bed,” she said.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Sarah Cragin, another student user of delivery services, said she has used it for party supplies like alcohol chasers because “we don’t realize we need it until the last second.”</p>\n<p>As students who once needed services unavailable in I.V., Welsh, Bakkie and Hammerstrom self-serviced. They filled not only their own needs as community members but also capitalized on the gap between supply and demand in I.V.</p>\n<p>As long as students in I.V. sustain their unique desires, student entrepreneurs will find a way to bridge the town’s gap of service.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1,3 of the Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74310\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74310\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/i-v-a-lucrative-market-for-deliveries/","id":4488,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[4487,4486,4485],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Million Short Romances","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2016-08-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/image.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/image.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Anjalie Tandon notes the beauty of embracing the everyday romance.

It is the product of way too many novels, movies, Broadway productions and adolescent dreams. In the interest of being alternative, let us draw attention to all the mini, short-lived romances.</p>\n<p>The solid one-minute eye contact you hold with the drummer of the local band you watched perform in the garage of some house on Sueno. The strangely engaging conversation you hold with the bagger at the Co-op. The knowing glance you share with the guy next to you in class. Some of these connections are so real and so powerful and they last just a second before they slip away.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Then there are those people that you meet accidentally on the street, at a party, at a meeting.

How they could ignite a fire and then just walk away with only small burns around the edges.</p>\n<p>But I have come to realize that maybe it is better this way. For in moments of such connection, there is no slow trickling of knowledge and information being transferred between people, rather it is all of you hitting all of them all at once. Two entities colliding. It’s powerful, it’s deadly and, thus, it is short lived.</p>\n<p>How can you take all that passion and force and try to forge a second encounter? You can’t. And maybe you shouldn’t want to. Maybe you shouldn’t wonder how something so real could just cease to be. Because the disappearing act that these romances play on us is what keeps the magic alive.</p>\n<p>There is nothing to ruin it. Just momentary magic, wonder, connection, mystery, allure — all taken away by the night. That’s the selfish thing about nighttime. It gives as much as it takes. How else can it maintain its mystery and allow you to keep setting fires within others?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Two entities colliding. It’s powerful, it’s deadly and, thus, it is short lived</p></blockquote>\n<p>And with every night comes the possibility of being able to see how your fire burns differently within each temporary soulmate. They provide you with just enough hope and reminder that there are still things that are real and true and intense. That you aren’t always operating on a frequency that is unreachable, you just have to find the right spark.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t always matter the origin of the spark, just that there is something that can reach within you and make you feel.</p>\n<p>So do not mourn your almost-lover. Let him go gentle into that good night. You were made better by his entrance, but you will not be made worse by his exit.</p>\n<p><em>Anjalie Tandon hopes we welcome each fleeting interaction</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72267\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72267\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-08-24/a-million-short-romances-2/","id":6307,"author":{"id":100,"name":"Anjalie Tandon"},"related":[6306,6305,6304],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/100"}},"__N_SSG":true}
