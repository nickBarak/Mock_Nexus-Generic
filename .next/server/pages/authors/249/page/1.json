As the night continued, attendees shared their personal experiences from the stage via poetry, spoken word and rap.<br>\nTran said the open mic list was the most important thing making its way through the crowd.<br>\n“I know it’s one of the most intimidating things to get up on stage and share work in front of strangers that you never met before … but for me I hope these words are the purest form of liberation,” Tran said.<br>\nThird-year political science major Marquel Carnell said performing made him introspective.<br>\n“It made me think about love and freedom, oppression, my heritage,” Carnell said. “It made me think about a lot of things and that’s what’s so cool about these open mics.”<br>\nFourth-year global studies major Lannhu Khuat said the event was her first time in the Biko House and the crowd was very supportive of different backgrounds.<br>\n“It was just amazing to be a part of an environment that welcomed so much diversity,” Khuat said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66397\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1149883661\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66412\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66397\" data-attachment-id=\"66397\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/biko-house-hosts-open-mic-night-with-mc-fong-tran/expression_by-stephen-manga-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447141463\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Expression_by Stephen Manga-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-66397\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1-1024x768.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Expression_by-Stephen-Manga-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Third-year art history major Abraham Lizama said open mic events are places where people can share positivity, adding that he has been attending open mics for years.<br>\n“It’s powerful in the sense that when a person shared, you felt what they felt,” Lizama said. “You can see everything that they were saying and that’s why I love coming to these events because it’s an experience that you don’t get elsewhere.”<br>\nTran said educating people on issues affecting minority students is an important part of creating a welcoming environment.<br>\n“You have to be conscious about the issues happening in society and recognize them … such as racism and forms of oppression,” Tran said.<br>\nTran said it can be easier to sing or rap about societal issues rather than discussing them.<br>\n“There’s ways to be true to those struggles but at the same time celebrate and heal,” Tran said. “We had a packed house, we had a super diverse community that came on, the energy was high and I couldn’t imagine a better event … It was really impressive that people seek these spaces.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
