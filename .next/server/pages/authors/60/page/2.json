Since then, Santa Barbara has swept teams such as Cal State Fullerton, UC Riverside, and upcoming opponent UC Davis during this tenured win streak.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think there were a lot of people that believed when we were 3-5 we’d move back to the upper echelon of the league,” UCSB Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Our team has definitely responded well [following this start].”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, this essence of hot streaks towards the end of the season is nothing new for Santa Barbara. The Gauchos ended Big West play last year on a five-game winning streak finishing against notable teams such as then first seeded UC Davis, third seeded UC Irvine, and fifth seeded Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Despite ending this season on such a good note, Santa Barbara does face some challenges when matching up against UC Davis. The Aggies host some offensive threats in Neal Monson, Josh Fox, and Darius Graham.</p>\n<p>Although not as effective in the Aggies’ two losses to UCSB during the regular season, Monson has been relatively efficient as of late, averaging 16.5 points in the past two games. In his third year at UCD, Monson is coming off a career night last Saturday against Cal State Northridge in which he registered his third double-double of the season with 21 points and 15 rebounds. These were both team-highs as Monson helped propel the Aggies in their 87-83 triple overtime win on the road.</p>\n<p>The duo of Fox and Graham will also be key for the Aggies against Santa Barbara. Fox, this year’s All-Big West Second Team honoree, has been a reliable scorer for Davis. The senior forward has proven to be dangerous down low scoring 20 or more points on six occasions this year as well as tallying double-figures in scoring in 21 games this season.</p>\n<p>Fox recorded 17 points in his last outing against Santa Barbara, going 8-15 from the floor along with seven rebounds. His ability to maneuver his way into the paint and take quality shots can be attributed to his versatile scoring capabilities as he ranked sixth in the conference with a 51.3 shooting percentage.</p>\n<p>Forwards Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe will have their hands full containing both Fox and Monson in the frontcourt as they will attempt to deny the Aggies’ interior attack and hope to limit Davis from scoring easy points in the paint.</p>\n<p>Junior Darius Graham is another central component to Davis’ unit. Awarded this year’s Big West Hustle Player of Year, it is Graham’s tenacious effort at both ends of the court that makes him a vital piece to the Aggies’ success.</p>\n<p>While Graham is only one of three Aggies who averages double figures in points, alongside Fox and junior guard Brynton Lemar, it is his motor and willingness to scrap for loose balls that sets him apart from the rest.</p>\n<p>Aside from Graham’s gritty demeanor on the floor, the third year player has proven to be a threat from beyond the arc. In his last two games against the Gauchos, Graham has hit 6-10 shots from behind the three-point line including a 3-4 performance from downtown in the Aggies’ 72-66 home loss to UCSB on Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>As for UCSB, Williams will rely on the shooting core of Michael Bryson, Gabe Vincent, and John Green to propel his team to victory.</p>\n<p>The three have been the most consistent for UCSB, averaging more than half of the team’s points— scoring 42.7 of the Gauchos’ 70.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>After missing six games this season due to a knee injury, three of which were during conference play, the redshirt senior is coming along nicely. Green is shooting an efficient 53 percent from the field during Santa Barbara’s win streak.</p>\n<p>“[John] has had great support around him,” Williams said. “He is a very strong man and drives through the windshield, not the rearview mirror.”</p>\n<p>Green has scored in double figures five times during the team’s current eight-game winning streak, including a team-high 14 points to go along with 10 rebounds on senior night in the Gauchos’ 69-50 win over Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“[We’re playing] with more discipline, but at the same time just having more fun,” Green said. “We’ve been trusting each other more. I’ve always said that it’s not what matters in the beginning of the year it’s what matters in early February and late March. It’s really clicking for us right now during the best time of the year.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff between UCSB and UCD is set for 12 p.m. at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA. The Quarterfinal matchup between Santa Barbara and Davis will air on Fox Prime Ticket.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68986\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68986\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsb-opens-big-west-tournament-against-uc-davis/","id":331,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[330,329,328],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Achieve Season Sweep of Cal Poly, End with Eight-Game Win Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCalPoly-20160305-DustinHarris-15-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team extended its winning streak to eight games after defeating Blue-Green rival Cal Poly 69-50 on Saturday.

UCSB also shot 6-12 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did a pretty good job of shot selection and getting ourselves to the rim,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “[Cal Poly] had an uncharacteristically bad shooting night from three and that gave us some separation in the game. We didn’t live at the three point line, we had some patience about getting the better shot and that’s when I think we’re a better team.”</p>\n<p>Never trailing at any point in Saturday’s game, it was the Gauchos’ fifth time in the last six games in which they led from start to finish. Santa Barbara has also held its opponents to a 35.8 shooting percentage during its eight-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, forward John Green had arguably his best performance of the season. Leading the Gauchos’ second unit, Green finished his final home game in dramatic fashion tallying in his first double-double of the year with a team-high 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Being able to bring John off the bench has been an unbelievable benefit to this team,” Williams said. “How efficient John has been the last two weeks takes us to a whole other level. People have to guard everywhere on the floor.”</p>\n<p>An uphill battle for last year’s Honorable Mention, Green missed all but four games his first three years under Coach Williams. Battling a series of foot, wrist and knee injuries, the redshirt senior has worked his way back to health and emerged as a major vocal point off the bench.</p>\n<p>“I look at my [injuries] as a learning experience,” Green said. “I just want to be a living testament for people and let him know that if you really love something don’t quit on it.”</p>\n<p>Green is averaging 15.7 points per game in the last three games, all of which he has led or come second on the team in scoring.</p>\n<p>Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe had a strong senior night performance as well. The two combined for 17 of UCSB’s 20 points in the paint along with six rebounds apiece. After a few stagnant possessions on offense, Beeler beat his man down the lane and connected on a go-ahead dunk from freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak giving the Gauchos a 53-42 lead. This provided UCSB with much needed momentum.</p>\n<p>“It’s fun playing especially when [me and Mitch] are productive,” Beeler said. “We work against each other every day so it’s great to see that work pay off for the both of us.”</p>\n<p>T.J. Taylor and Dajuan Smith played some quality minutes and made an effect around the perimeter. Smith also contributed five points of his own, including a three-point shot from the top of the key with 11:59 to go in the first half.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly made a late push with 5:23 to go off a made three-pointer by guard Taylor Sutlive. The Gauchos quickly responded however, as Green dished a no-look pass to Brewe for a layup to give UCSB a seven-point advantage. From then on, Santa Barbara went 5-6 from the free throw line to finish out the game.</p>\n<p>Gabe Vincent helped seal the deal for the Gauchos. With just 34 seconds left in regulation, the sophomore guard pulled up from the top of the key rising over Minnesota-transfer Josh Martin and drained a shot from beyond the arc. Vincent tied Green’s performance registering 14 points as well.</p>\n<p>Senior David Nwaba led the way for Cal Poly, scoring a team-high 15 points while going 9-13 at the free-throw line along with grabbing nine rebounds. Nwaba was Cal Poly’s primary offensive target the first time these two teams faced, scoring 16 points in the Mustangs’ 76-73 loss at home on Jan. 14.</p>\n<p>In addition to their regular season sweep of their Blue-Green rival, the Gauchos clinched the fourth seed in the Big West Conference Tournament. UCSB will face UC Davis in the Quarterfinal round. Tip-off will take place at 12 p.m. on March 10 at the Honda Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-07/gauchos-achieve-season-sweep-of-cal-poly-end-with-eight-game-win-streak/","id":325,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[324,323,322],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Soar in 2nd Half to Defeat UCR 81-55, Host Cal Poly Saturday for Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.11.2014-1175.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.11.2014-1175.jpg?resize=851%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A new record was etched into UCSB men's basketball history as the Gauchos tallied their seventh consecutive Big West victory in a season with their 81-55 victory over UC Riverside Thursday night.

The Highlanders are in a three-way tie for fifth-place between UC Davis and Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara converted on three of its first four possessions, opening the game with a 6-0 run. Riverside Head Coach Dennis Cutts quickly called a timeout, benching his starting lineup for a fresh five.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos capitalized on the Highlander’s second-man rotation, jumping out to a 14-4 lead. Freshman forward Jarriesse Blackmon scored five of his career-high nine points in the first five minutes of the game, taking a pass from guard Gabe Vincent and connecting from three with 17:29 to go.</p>\n<p>“I was nervous [taking the starting job], but I also understand that I have to be ready when my name is called,” said Blackmon. “I was fortunate enough to have it called in the beginning of the game and bring that same type of energy I had starting the season.”</p>\n<p>Blackmon has started three-straight games for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Following a 14-4 run dealt by the Gauchos, Riverside battled its way back. Freshman center Menno Dijkstra made his presence known in the paint. The 7’0” footer tallied in all 10 of his points in the first half going a perfect 5-5 from the floor.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Gentrey Thomas also scored all 10 of his points in the first period including a nifty finger roll which put the score at 35-38 with 1:39 remaining prior to halftime.</p>\n<p>After an even first half, the Gauchos came out with a sense of urgency moving out to a 21-3 run. Michael Bryson took control scoring 11 of his game-high 19 points in the second half. Bryson was 4-4 from the floor in the second, including a go-ahead alley-oop from teammate T.J. Taylor which put the score at 65-45 with 8:39 to play.</p>\n<p>“It was a great pass,” said Bryson. “Watching [T.J.] throw it in the air, I thought it was going to be bad but I was able to go up and get it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had other weapons in support of Bryson’s performance. Seniors Taylor, Dajuan Smith, and John Green all played their part in yesterday’s win scoring 26 of Santa Barbara’s bench points. Gabe Vincent had an effective night as well adding 11 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to match up with us right now because we’re so deep,” Bryson said. “Everybody that comes in is contributing something. It’s a tough road for anyone who meets us in March.”</p>\n<p>Green was the main catalyst off the bench scoring 14 points in 21 minutes as well as hitting a season-high four three pointers. Prior to Thursday’s match, Green came off a season-high 19-point performance in Santa Barbara’s win against Cal State Fullerton Feb. 27.</p>\n<p>“I’ve just been trying to focus on making shots when my opportunity comes, so during the game I can put them up, follow through, and make sure it goes in,” Green said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos shot 29-55 for the game as well as shooting 50 percent, 12-24, from the three-point line.</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara’s offense hit its stride, its defensive presence helped to set it apart in the second half. After allowing a 46.7 shooting percentage in the first period, UCSB held the Highlanders to a 21.4 field goal percentage in the second half. They shot 6-28 from the field, including 2-14 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“The difference [in the game] was we were really good defensively in the second half,” Williams said. “Our effort night in and night out has been better. Our activity level has to stay high on the defensive end in order to be where we want to be.”</p>\n<p>Michael Bryson, Sam Beeler, Mitch Brewe, T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, and John Green will play their final home game this Saturday, March 5 as UCSB takes on rival Cal Poly. This stands as an opportunity for the seniors to leave their final imprints in a blue and gold uniform.</p>\n<p>“[This moment] will be bittersweet,” said Green. “Senior night will be a big day for us. I just want to make sure the six seniors including myself build a legacy here and create history for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently on a four-game winning streak against Cal Poly. Tip-off between the Gauchos and Mustangs will be at 4 p.m. in the Thunderdome. An honorary ceremony for the seniors will take place following the game.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68878\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68878\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-04/gauchos-soar-in-2nd-half-to-defeat-ucr-81-55-host-cal-poly-saturday-for-senior-day/","id":324,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[323,322,321],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos To Close Season at Home with UCR and Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team has won six straight games over conference opponents and will look to extend its streak against UCR and Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Following an 80-62 victory at Cal State Fullerton last weekend, the UCSB men’s basketball team hopes to extend its six-game winning streak to eight games as it will host UC Riverside tonight and Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“Winning builds an adrenaline level, and I think our adrenaline [for games] has been good,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve been playing much looser, harder and made major improvements defensively.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68785\" style=\"width: 909px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68785\" data-attachment-id=\"68785\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/gabe-vincent-shuffles-toward-the-hoop-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-12-web.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gabe Vincent shuffles toward the hoop.

UCSB has beaten all of its opponents by double-figures during its six-game win streak.</p>\n<p>After starting the year with a conference record of 2-4, the Gauchos have matured from their rough start gaining some valuable momentum as they near the Big West Tournament. Coach Williams accredits the team’s solid play to its tough matches against Long Beach State and Hawaii early in its conference schedule.</p>\n<p>“We came out absolutely flat [for Hawaii and Long Beach],” Williams said. “We were humbled by [these losses] and have come out with a much greater sense of urgency.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Michael Bryson will certainly pose as a mismatch on offense for Riverside, gradually coming into his own during the Gauchos’ winning stretch.<br>\nBryson, who earned himself his second nomination as the Big West Player of the Week this year on Monday, propelled the Gauchos to victory last Saturday after scoring a team-high 19 points.</p>\n<p>Connecting from deep five times on Saturday, the fourth-year starter broke James Powell’s record for the most three-pointers in school history, moving to first all-time with 223. Bryson now has 1,523 career points, just 57 shy of seventh place all-time for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Bryson’s recent shooting stroke will enable Williams to run spread sets on offense, keeping defenses discipline beyond the arc. The 6’4” guard is currently shooting 61 percent from three in his last two games.</p>\n<p>Bryson, who leads the conference in scoring with 18.5 points per game, has scored double-figures in 25 of 26 games this season.</p>\n<p>As for Head Coach Dennis Cutts and the Highlanders, junior forward Secean Johnson will be the go-to guy on offense. After dismissing All-Big West forward Taylor Johns from the team for undisclosed team violations, Johnson has embraced a larger role for Riverside down in the post.</p>\n<p>Now seeing an increase in minutes, the junior transfer is averaging 19.0 points and 8.0 rebounds in his last two games, contest in which Johns was inactive.</p>\n<p>Johns, last season’s All-Big West First Team honoree, averaged 15.5 points and 7.5 rebounds this year for UCR.</p>\n<p>For Saturday night’s game, the Gauchos must contain seniors Reese Morgan and David Nwaba. Morgan is coming off two career games, scoring 23 points against Cal State Northridge and dropping another 22 in his senior night game against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Nwaba will be another defensive concern for UCSB. The Santa Monica College transfer led the Mustangs in their last outing against Santa Barbara, scoring a team-high 16 points to go along with nine rebounds. Look for Bryson to be matched up with the 6’4” Nwaba as he uses his frame to slash his way to the rim.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will also honor seniors Sam Beeler, Mitch Brewe, T.J. Taylor, Dajuan Smith, John Green and Michael Bryson on Saturday. Williams expects an intense crowd and rowdy atmosphere to be a central component in propelling his seniors to victory.</p>\n<p>“We hope it gets rowdy [on Saturday],” Williams said. “Our seniors deserve it — they’ve had really great careers here and it’ll be great for the student body and community to pay tribute to these kids.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game begins at 7 p.m. The Blue-Green rivalry will be reignited Saturday, March 5 at 4 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/gauchos-to-close-season-at-home-with-ucr-and-cal-poly/","id":352,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[351,350,349],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Makes It Four Straight With Win Over UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.21_StephenManga_MensBBall-6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.21_StephenManga_MensBBall-6-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos continued their hot run to improve to 7-5 in conference play and are now two games out of second place.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68455\" style=\"width: 251px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68455\" data-attachment-id=\"68455\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/eric-childress-drives-into-the-paint-for-a-layup-stephen-mangadaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.21_StephenManga_MensBBall-6-web.jpg?fit=800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Eric Childress drives into the paint for a layup.

Our defense, energy, and everything about us is getting better and better.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, which was 3-5 and in sixth place in conference to begin the month of February, now improves to 7-5 in the Big West with an overall record of 13-12. The Gauchos are two games back from second place UC Irvine and Long Beach State, both hosting a Big West record of 9-3.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Aggies, 10-16 overall, lose their fourth straight game and drop to a conference record of 5-8.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gotten back over the break even mark and that’s a very good thing,” Williams stated. “I thought we played really hard tonight. We didn’t shoot well, which they had a lot to do with, but we played very hard.”</p>\n<p>While it wasn’t the cleanest first half for either team, committing a total of 21 turnovers, the Gauchos jumped out to a 31-20 advantage at halftime due to the shooting hand of Vincent. The shooting guard out of Stockton, CA went 4-7 from the field scoring seven of his teams first 13 points. Vincent led all scorers at the break with 10 points.</p>\n<p>Drawing two early fouls and struggling to find his rhythm offensively, senior guard Michael Bryson made his presence known in other categories during the first half. The 6’4” wing recorded seven rebounds, two blocks, and three steals. Bryson also hit home six of his teams seven free throws in the first period, going a perfect six-for six behind the free throw stripe.</p>\n<p>Facing an uphill battle similar to their match on Thursday, the Aggies clawed their way back in the second half this time from 11-points. Davis shaved the Gauchos’ lead down to five with 18:27 to go as junior Brynton Lamar finished strong to the rack and then followed it up with a mid-range jump shot to have his team trail 26-31.</p>\n<p>The third year guard finished second in scoring for Davis on Saturday, one point shy of senior Josh Fox’s team-high 17 points. Not only Lemar keep the game within reach scoring 11 of his 16 points in the second half, the San Diego, CA native earned himself a double-double crashing the boards on offense and defense for a total of 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite a strong effort from Fox and Lemar, the Gauchos ended the game in dramatic fashion as junior guard Eric Childress led a 3-on-2 break and dished a no-look pass to Vincent for the go-ahead dunk with 1:02 remaining. Vincent’s slam magnified UCSB’s lead to 10 after that point.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also had a major boost from its bench, including a 9-point contribution from senior forward Mitch Brewe. The 6’8” senior scored seven of his nine points in the first half and helped add to the Gauchos’ season-high 13 steals with two picks.</p>\n<p>“I just tried to bring a lot of energy physicality, and a big defensive presence [tonight],” Brewe said. “I didn’t do a good job of finishing in the beginning of the game but [afterwards] got in a rhythm a little bit. I think coming off the bench bringing a lot of energy and keeping the level high is really important.”</p>\n<p>“It was a team win for everybody tonight,” said Childress. “We just knew we had to make plays.[Davis] is a physical team and when we have a night like this when we’re not shooting well we have to be aggressive back with them and our bench came in and did that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has outscored its opponents’ bench in each of its last four games, averaging 20.5 points per game. This is a reasonable chunk of their 70.1 point average per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara sets foot on its two-game road trip this week starting with a Thursday night match against Cal State Northridge and a Saturday game at Fullerton. The Gauchos game at CSUN will take place in the Matadome at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68480\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68480\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/mens-basketball-makes-it-four-straight-with-win-over-uc-davis/","id":348,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[347,346,345],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Able to Earn Third-Straight Victory, Win 65-55 on the Road at UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MBasketball_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MBasketball_Stephen-Manga-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With the Big West Conference Tournament rapidly approaching, the UCSB men's basketball team is starting to play its best basketball at the right moment.

Green came off the bench in attack mode, hitting a mid-range jumper and three-pointer all within the 11<sup>th</sup> minute of the first half. The two went 7-11 from the floor in the first half, playing a major role in UCSB’s 29-18 advantage at halftime.</p>\n<p>Senior guard T.J. Taylor also added the exclamation point with seven seconds left in the first. Off a UCR turnover, Taylor went coast-to-coast maneuvering past a defender and hit a buzzer-beating three with one second to spare.</p>\n<p>Taylor tied season-highs with eight points and four assists in nineteen minutes off the bench.</p>\n<p>While the Highlanders had their troubles in the first half, shooting 7-28 from the field, guards Gentrey Thomas and Jaylen Bland helped turn things around. Riverside chipped at its 11-point deficit as Thomas connected on a three-point shot followed by a strong finish to the rim. This five-point swing helped pull the score to 32-30 with 16:40 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>Helping bring UCR within the Gauchos’ lead was the Highlanders’ senior captain in Bland. With 6:40 left in regulation, Bland knocked down his 100<sup>th</sup> three-pointer of the season, a Big West best, to trim UCSB’s lead to 50-44 with 6:40 to go.</p>\n<p>While Bland entered Thursday with the fourth-best scoring average in the Big West of 16.5 points per game, the Murray State transfer did not have the most efficient shooting night from the floor, going 4-15 overall and 3-11 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>Bland has had a rocky scoring stretch during his past three games, averaging 8.3 points per game including a 1-8 shooting night and season-low five points against Cal Poly on Feb. 13.</p>\n<p>With the Highlanders quickly on its heels, Santa Barbara converted at the free-throw line going 11-12 in the final six minutes to secure its victory. Overall, UCSB went 18-25 from behind the free-throw line, including the reliable foul shooting of senior forward Sam Beeler, who hit four of his six made free-throws in the last five minutes of play.</p>\n<p>With the absence of Johns, the Highlanders relied heavily on junior forward Secean Johnson to keep UCR within reach. After losing his starting spot last Saturday to sophomore forward Alex Larsson, the Juco transfer had a monster game playing all but five minutes Thursday night as he led Riverside in scoring with 21 points.</p>\n<p>Johnson recorded his second double-double of the season, grabbing 10 rebounds in the match—five offensive and five defensive. His versatility on the court resulted in him recording two assists, one block, and a pair of steals as well. However, Johnson’s performance was not enough to stall UCSB from earning its 65-55 win.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Gauchos collecting their sixth conference victory of the season, Head Coach Bob Williams joined Pacific’s Bob Thomason and UNLV’s Jerry Tarkanian as the only coaches in Big West history to ever achieve 300 wins.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will look to defend home court in a rematch versus UC Davis tomorrow, Feb. 20 as tip-off will begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68438\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68438\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/gauchos-able-to-earn-third-straight-victory-win-65-55-on-the-road-at-ucr/","id":346,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[345,344,343],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks to Extend Streak Against UCR, Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUF-20160206-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team is fourth in the Big West standings with a 5-5 conference record and is could reach the .500 mark overall with a win over UCR tonight.

Aside from the 29 combined points that sophomore guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Michael Bryson tallied home, Bob Williams accredits this victory to a collective team effort from other players on his squad.</p>\n<p>“It’s crucial when other guys make contributions offensively for us [because] it turns us into a much more efficient team,” Williams said. “John Green was alive … Sam Beeler was really effective [on the floor], and Eric Childress continues to be money shooting the ball from the three-point line. This gives us a lot of balance because opponents are going to pay a lot of attention to Michael and Gabe.”</p>\n<p>Most notably, the Gauchos shot a season-high 23-26 from the free-throw line last Thursday.</p>\n<p>Against Riverside, UCSB will have to contain the senior duo of forward Taylor Johns and guard Jaylen Bland. The two are the best frontcourt-backcourt combo in the conference, combining for 32 points per game, Bland at 16.5 and Johns at 15.5.</p>\n<p>Johns carried the Highlanders in their 78-86 loss to Cal Poly last week. The senior scored a game-high 25 points in 38 minutes, also tallying his fifth double-double of the season with 10 boards.</p>\n<p>While Bland only scored five points in his last match, he and Johns have scored 20-plus or more points in seven games this season.</p>\n<p>Looking to avenge their six-point loss last Thursday and upset UCSB at home, junior guard and Darius Graham and senior forward Josh Fox will play pivotal roles Saturday night against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Graham is coming off a big game against the Gauchos scoring a game-high 19 points while going 3-4 from downtown. The 5-10” floor general has shown signs of being an offensive threat, leading Davis in scoring five times this season including a 21-point outing in its 58-55 win against Riverside.</p>\n<p>Big man Josh Fox will try and compliment Graham’s guard play down low in the post. Last year’s Big West Sixth Man of the Year, the forward has been having an unforgettable senior campaign leading all Aggies in scoring with 14.2 per game and field goal percentage with 51.5 percent. Fox has led his team in scoring 10 times this season while scoring 17 or more points in ten occasions.</p>\n<p>With regard to last Thursday at UC Davis, a conference win was not the only achievement Coach Williams accomplished against his former team. Coaching the Aggies from 1990-1998, the three-time Big West Coach of the Year collected his 299th win last Thursday.</p>\n<p>While this milestone is a notable one, just one victory shy of being the 3rd coach ever in conference to eclipse the 300-win mark, Williams says at this point it is just a number.</p>\n<p>“The win at Davis meant a lot to me because it was home for eight years … but I’m just not attached to the number of accumulated wins at this stage in my life,” Williams stated. “Maybe 10 years from now when I’m reading through a scrapbook that will be something that means something to me.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face UCR tonight at 8 p.m. UCSB returns to action in the Thunderdome this Saturday, Feb. 20 versus UC Davis, which is set for a 7 p.m. tip-off time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 18, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68353\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68353\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-18/ucsb-looks-to-extend-streak-against-ucr-davis/","id":344,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[343,342,341],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Resurgent Second Half Performance Earns 81-68 Win vs. CSUF","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016.02.04_StephenManga_MensBasketBall-7-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"A total of 54 points scored in the second half helped the UCSB men's basketball team to overcome a seven-point deficit coming out of halftime.

The Gauchos responded with improved energy and effort coming out of halftime, outhustling Fullerton in statistical categories that included rebounding, assists, field goal percentage, and ball possession.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara controlled the pace of the game in every facet of the second half— shooting 66 percent from the field and 77 percent from downtown while it contained the Titans for the majority of Saturday’s contest, holding CSUF to a dismal overall field goal percentage of 38 percent.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos capitalized on their trips to the line as well, making 13-17 on the night from behind the stripe to finish with a 76.5 free-throw percentage, a major improvement from their 53.8 percent outing against Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Influencing UCSB’s improvement on offense in the second half was its ability to penetrate the Titans’ defense when driving the ball.</p>\n<p>“We got great space off of our drives [in the second half],” Williams said. “Our penetration created open shots for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, UCSB was poised when handling the ball. It concluded Satuday’s game with just nine turnovers, a total below the Gauchos’ season average of 13.3 per game.</p>\n<p>Junior point guard Eric Childress played a major role in UCSB’s victory Saturday night, registering only one turnover in the game’s entirety.</p>\n<p>Childress, learning from his six point and five turnover performance last Thursday against Hawaii, was aggressive with his attack which provided a much-needed boost behind scoring threats Gabe Vincent and Michael Bryson. The Hawthorne, CA native finished with 13 points and seven assists on the night.</p>\n<p>“Eric was shooting the ball under great control and had great poise,” Williams said. “He looked so in control of his game offensively and it really caused problems for Fullerton’s guards.”</p>\n<p>Childress’ control of the ball also resulted in more scoring opportunities for Vincent and Bryson. The two tallied 45 points Saturday night, 20 for the sophomore guard and 25 for the senior Bryson. It was an efficient shooting night for Vincent as he finished 7-15 from the floor and made a game-high 5-7 from behind the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to be aggressive and look for shots to attack,” Vincent said. “We can always get shots up from the perimeter, I was hitting the three tonight, but I was really trying to get out in transition and get to the rim.”</p>\n<p>Bryson also flirted with a triple-double, grabbing a game-high nine rebounds and tying Childress’ game-high of seven assists. His 25-point performance helped him to climb to eighth-place on the Gauchos’ all-time scoring list.</p>\n<p>Young players like Jarriesse Blackmon contributed quality minutes this weekend as well. While the freshman forward did not score in his nine minutes of action, the Salt Lake City native pulled down a career-high eight boards for his team, five of them offensive rebounds giving UCSB second chance opportunities.</p>\n<p>“[Jarriese] is not afraid of the moment and not afraid to try and make plays,” Williams stated. “He’s a high energy guy and that’s what we needed out of him tonight.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will hope to take Saturday’s home victory and use its momentum for the team’s two-game road trip starting at UC Davis.</p>\n<p>“[We need to take] the energy, enthusiasm, and accountability we played with tonight into next week,” Williams said. “[Our guys] understand that we’ve dug ourselves a whole and the only way to get out of it is by playing hard and playing better.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will travel to the Pavillion on Thursday, Feb. 11 to face the Aggies. Tip-off will take place at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67996\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67996\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-08/gauchos-resurgent-second-half-performance-earns-81-68-win-vs-csuf/","id":339,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[338,337,336],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Unable to Maintain Tempo in Second Half, Lose 76-64 to Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-12.05.2014-1-of-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-12.05.2014-1-of-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men's basketball team was unable to capitalize on its momentum of handing UCI its first Big West loss of the season.

A stagnant offense and 14 turnovers propelled Hawaii to an 11-4 run over UCSB, extending the Rainbow Warriors’ lead to 47-40 with 13:45 remaining. Hawaii never trailed after this point in the game.</p>\n<p>While neither team was able to establish an offensive presence until five minutes remained in the second half, Coach Williams was not pleased with his team’s lack of energy.</p>\n<p>“Two of the last three games [at home] we’ve come out with minimal effort and its unacceptable,” Williams said. “It’s hard to explain why you would have better energy [on the road] than in your own house.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are currently 1-3 this year in conference games when playing in the Thunderdome. While UCSB has managed to find its rhythm against tough teams on the road, it hasen’t had the best record as of late defending home court.</p>\n<p>“Maybe we feed off the crowd on the road, or maybe it’s an us-against-the-world attitude, but either way we are definitely a better team away from home,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Despite a tough loss, freshman forward Maxwell Kupchak made his presence known down low. In his 13<sup>th</sup> start of the season, the 6’7” forward battled it out with Hawaii’s frontcourt of  Mike Thomas and Stefan Jankovic, finishing with six points off 3-5 shooting.</p>\n<p>While his stat line wasn’t the greatest, Kupchak came up clutch when his team needed him finishing at the rim within closing seconds of the first half slicing the lead to three. Kupchak also had another strong drive with 7:46 to play, pulling his team to a 56-54 deficit.</p>\n<p>“Max is a real smart player, his basketball IQ is very high especially for a freshman,” Vincent said of his fellow teammate. “He knows how to play the game so we’ve been getting some good minutes from him especially with John [Green] going down. We need more from [Max] and it will come.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii also took advantage of its trips to the free-throw line, scoring 22 points behind the stripe compared to seven for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to avenge their loss this Saturday, Feb. 6 as they will face Cal State Fullerton. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67963\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67963\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-05/ucsb-unable-to-maintain-tempo-in-second-half-lose-76-64-to-hawaii/","id":371,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[370,369,368],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Set to Face Another Big West Heavyweight in Hawaii at Home this Thursday, Host CSUF Saturday","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUN-20160123-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MBball_vsCSUN-20160123-DustinHarris-11-web.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"After handing UCI its first conference loss of the season,the UCSB men's basketball team is on the search for yet another upset victory as it prepares to face Hawaii this Thursday.

Taylor to translate over to this week’s match.</p>\n<p>Childress has found his niche as the floor general for UCSB after taking over for former senior and starting point guard Zalmico Harmon. The junior from Hawthorne is among the top guards in the Big West in shooting ability and ball handing, leading the conference in three-point percentage at 51.2 percent and ranking third with an average of 4.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>“The play of Eric has steadily grown throughout the year,” Williams said. “He’s played exceptionally well this last month having one of the best assist-to-turnover ratios on the West coast and shooting from over 50 percent beyond the arc.” [Eric] is really making strides as a player, leader, and helping run the show for us so I’m really proud of him,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>The development of Childress has been evident this year and as of recently he has averaged a total to 10 ppg in the team’s last five contests.</p>\n<p>For Taylor, the senior guard is embracing his role as the sixth man for UCSB. Following a six-game drought without scoring a basket, Williams believes Taylor’s eight point outing on Saturday will open up more opportunities for him as he continues to play quality minutes behind Childress.</p>\n<p>“T.J. hasn’t really had any real opportunities [these past couple of games], but for him to snap out of it and hit a couple big shots was a real spark plug,” Williams said. “He is beloved by this team and to have him step up and contribute was special.”</p>\n<p>It’s been a steady incline for the 5-9” Oakland guard after sitting out the entire 2013-2014 season with a medical redshirt. As his minutes increase, Taylor’s shooting ability will likely draw opponents and leave the floor open for guards Gabe Vincent and Michael Bryson.</p>\n<p>As for first-year Head Coach Eran Ganot and the Warriors, Thursday will also be a defining moment within their conference schedule after having their seven-game winning streak snapped at home by senior guard Nick Faust and the Long Beach State 49ers.</p>\n<p>Hawaii fell to the ‘Beach’ 78-64 last Saturday as Faust erupted for 28 points on 5-8 shooting from downtown. With hopes of bouncing back from the loss, Ganot will likely utilize his deep rotation of guards in Thursday’s matchup by running the team’s offensive sets through All-Big West players Roderick Bobbitt and Aaron Valdes.</p>\n<p>The two guards have been the offensive anchors for the Warriors combining for a total of nine 20-plus point outings this season. The only duo to exceed that this year are UC Riverside’s own Taylor Johns and Jaylen Bland leading the conference with 14 20-plus scoring performances.</p>\n<p>Third year forward Mike Thomas looks to have a strong presence on the road as well finishing with a career-high 20 points in last week’s loss to Long Beach. The junior has been a mismatch against bigs down low using his speedy 6’7” frame to slash by defenders and finish at the rim. Thomas went 7-11 from the field on Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB begins its home stand against Hawaii this Thursday, Feb. 4 at 7 p.m. The Gauchos will also welcome Cal State Fullerton to the Thunderdome on Saturday, Feb. 6 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67888\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67888\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-03/ucsb-set-to-face-another-big-west-heavyweight-in-hawaii-at-home-this-thursday-host-csuf-saturday/","id":367,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[366,365,364],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Helping Tackle the Flint Water Crisis: Detroit Lions’ Defensive End Ziggy Ansah","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?resize=600%2C450&ssl=1","description":"The water crisis of Flint, Michigan has negatively altered the lifestyle of nearly all of its citizens as lead continues to contaminate water sources.

Most notably, this is an off the field feat that may be even more significant than anything Detroit Lions’ defensive end Ziggy Ansah has done on the field.</p>\n<p>Ansah’s rise to the national spotlight is not only due to his efforts on the gridiron, but more importantly his outreach to a struggling city of Michigan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For the town of Flint and the 26-year old pro-bowler, the No. 94 possesses more importance than just being two digits stitched on his jersey. In an effort to rescue the region from its lead-contaminated water crisis, Ansah assembled a crew of teammates with one goal in mind: giving back. The Former BYU Cougar donated 94,000 bottles of water to his local community as an act of relief.</p>\n<p>A city where 40 percent of its inhabitants live in poverty, Flint has suffered the brute end of this water calamity following the city’s irrigation switch from Lake Huron in Detroit to the tainted Flint River. An ongoing epidemic since April of 2014, the citizens of Flint have voiced their frustrations to Governor Rich Snyder, yet limited progress has been made.</p>\n<p>As a result, Ansah took matters in to his own hands.</p>\n<p>The Ghana native opened up about his experiences living in the continent of Africa, empathizing with the citizens of Flint and their burdens of living under harmful irrigation conditions.</p>\n<p>“Coming from Africa, I know exactly what it means to not have clean water or to not have water at all,” Ansah stated per the Free Press. “For me to be in a position where me and my [teammates] can help out these fans down here is a great honor to us.”</p>\n<p>Fellow teammates Haloti Ngata, Darryl Tapp, Gabe Wright, Jason Jones, Joique Bell, and Tennessee Titan Angelo Blackson aided Ansah with their services stocking up cases of water and transporting them to the Flint Food Bank, Brennan Park Community Center, and other local recreation centers.</p>\n<p>With help from the Lions organization, 1,680 cases of water were safely distributed to areas affected by the water crisis, exceeding Ansah’s original goal.</p>\n<p>Among others who gave back was the defensive line of the Washington Redskins, contributing 3,600 Fiji water bottles in support of Ansah’s cause. Rapper and Detroit-native Big Sean also donated $10,000 in response to his #HEALFLINTKIDS campaign.</p>\n<p>As various other professional athletes and celebrities continue to donate water in support of minimizing the Flint water crisis, each contribution is a reminder of the platform that sports, music, and individuals of other professions possess in being able to have a universal influence that extends beyond the title of their career.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_67654\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67654\" data-attachment-id=\"67654\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-26/helping-tackle-the-flint-water-crisis-detroit-lions-defensive-end-ziggy-ansah/ansah/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ansah\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-67654\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ansah.png?resize=600%2C450\" alt=\"Ansah (red beanie) and his teammates.

In a packed FedEx Forum Arena with roughly over 18,000 in attendance, Grizzlies fans paid homage to a figure whose leadership permeated the streets of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>In April of 1968, King traveled to Memphis supporting a coalition of African-American workers and their fight for equal working conditions. King was a steady activist for the Memphis Sanitation Strike addressing this poor treatment and racial discrimination clearly to then-city mayor Henry Loeb.</p>\n<p>Following his infamous “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech, King checked into the local Lorraine Hotel, now the National Civil Rights Museum. This was where the abolitionist lived his final days as he was assassinated on April 4, 1968. While King’s death marked the end of the 39-year olds civil activism, to this day his presence lives on for the people of Memphis as well as within the Grizzlies organization.</p>\n<p>Starting guard Tony Allen acknowledged how Dr. King stood for more than just social equality, but also for athletes like himself to continue their passion of sports. “Martin Luther King paved the way for guys like myself to have the opportunity to be around now, Allen told NBA reporter Mark Jones. “It felt good to be honoring [this man] and playing on this day.”</p>\n<p>Grizzly big man Zach Randolph also touched on MLK’s special day stating, “What [King] did for us was to give us freedom, someway or somehow. Racism still exists in this world today, but he was a leader and he showed other African-Americans that they could be anything they wanted to be and they could speak from their heart and live the dream and do the right thing,” Randolph told USA Today. “Nobody can tell you what to do and you believe in yourself.”</p>\n<p>What stood as a regulatory match between two NBA teams spoke volumes to the city of Memphis, a region who shared the memories of Dr. King and his civil quest for freedom.

This is UCSB’s first ten-win season since 2008. The Titans improve to 15-3-1 overall and 7-3 in the Big West.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Fullerton came out swinging in the first half with Burkenroad’s goal the 11<sup>th</sup> minute. Senior forward Rebecca Wilson led Burkenroad down the field resulting in a chip shot past senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter, giving her team the early 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly responded by scoring a goal in the 18<sup>th</sup> minute off a breakaway from sophomore forward Amanda Ball. Ball split her defenders and scored on an unassisted goal launching a shot into the back left of the net.</p>\n<p>The Chino Hills forward netted three goals in her final three games, the first being a game-winner in the Gauchos’ 1-0 victory over Fullerton last Tuesday. Ball has recorded all of her five goals on the year after missing eight games due to injury.</p>\n<p>Following Ball’s score the freshmen duo of Sydney Magnin and Maddie Gibson connected on a goal of their own. Magnin put Gibson in scoring position off a line drive touch pass. Making her way down the field, Gibson snuck the ball past Big West Keeper of the Year Jennifer Stuart into the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The All-Big West Freshman broke the 1-1 bind and secured her team a 2-1 lead heading into the halftime break. Magnin and Gibson have been key assets to this young UCSB team recording six of the freshman’s 22 goals and 13 points for the year.</p>\n<p>Opening up the second period it was the play of Burkenroad and Wilson that kept things in favor for the Titans. The senior veterans took control of the half with a goal from Burkenroad in the 47<sup>th</sup> and 63<sup>rd</sup> minute.</p>\n<p>Big West Offensive Player of the Year Rebecca Wilson tallied in her second and third assists on the night setting up Burkenroad yet again for two easy scores and the 3-2 advantage.</p>\n<p>With momentum on their side, the Titans sealed the deal off an insurance kick from midfielder Connie Caliz. The redshirt sophomore made her moment in front of goal count, registering her third goal of the season. Fullerton preserved their comfortable lead after that point keeping its playoff hopes alive with a 4-2 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite a high-charged attack from Fullerton, Santa Barbara had an efficient outing on offense as well. The Gauchos outshot the Titans 12-10 in shots on goal and 3-1 in corner kicks. While UCSB had many chances in front of goal it was unable to capitalize.</p>\n<p>Despite an unfortunate end to the year, there is nowhere to go but up for this young team. The Gauchos have exceeded expectations for the season after being projected to finish sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>As seniors Beth Ritter, Angelisa Cortez, and Savannah Francis end their collegiate careers at UCSB their roles will be handed down to their 19 underclassmen. Gaining valuable experience from a tough nonconference schedule, rigorous conference play, and this Big West Tournament, the Gauchos will look to build on their successful year next season.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/burkenroad-hat-trick-sinks-gauchos-in-first-round-of-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/burkenroad-hat-trick-sinks-gauchos-in-first-round-of-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/burkenroad-hat-trick-sinks-gauchos-in-first-round-of-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/burkenroad-hat-trick-sinks-gauchos-in-first-round-of-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/burkenroad-hat-trick-sinks-gauchos-in-first-round-of-big-west-tournament/","id":1466,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1465,1464,1463],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Head into Postseason with No. 2 Seed","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.10.23_StephenManga_WSoccer-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.10.23_StephenManga_WSoccer-9-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"For the first time since 2009, the UCSB women's soccer team will compete in the Big West Tournament.

Each team concluded its conference schedule with a 6-2 record and a total 18 points.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos are coming off a demanding week in which they played in two senior night matches against Fullerton and Cal State Northridge. After pulling off the upset Thursday night against the Titans, the Matadors made sure to spoil Santa Barbara’s five-game winning streak with a 4-3 overtime win off a penalty kick from junior midfielder Kourtney Kutscher.</p>\n<p>Despite ending conference play on a bitter note, Head Coach Paul Stumpf believes the tough loss has helped prepare UCSB for its postseason matchup.</p>\n<p>“It’s good to know the team’s characters are intact [from this loss], they will fight to the end and they can score three goals in eleven minutes if the conditions are right. There definitely were some good lessons to take from [this weekend],” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite a one-game skid, the Gauchos have finished their season strong, winning seven of their last nine matches. Helping guide his team to its third regular season title with an overall record of 13-5-1, Stumpf claimed his second Big West Coach of the Year Award.<br>\nStumpf’s coaching and ability to pull out late-game victories has paid dividends for the team as UCSB will see its first Big West Tournament appearance since 2009. Santa Barbara is 3-3-3 overall in the conference tournament, having its previous postseason match against Cal Poly end in a 1-1 tie.</p>\n<p>UCSB is welcomed back to the tournament with the tough task of trying to contain the 2015-16 Big West Offensive Player of the year in Fullerton’s Rebecca Wilson. The redshirt senior forward has carried her team all season long, scoring 18 goals on the year, the most of any Big West player this season.</p>\n<p>Wilson led Fullerton past Cal Poly on the road last Sunday, recording both of the team’s goals in a 2-1 win. The senior has compiled 77 starts in her four years at CSFU, including five game-winning goals, tied for the sixth most in Titans’ history.</p>\n<p>In preparation of Fullerton’s high-powered offense, the Gauchos will depend on the forward duo of freshman Mallory Hromatko and sophomore Amanda Ball to lead their offensive attack. The two forwards were huge pieces in Santa Barbara’s match against Fullerton and CSUN. Hromatko assisted Ball on the game-winning goal against CSFU while Ball also scored the 3-3 equalizer to send UCSB into overtime against the Matadors.</p>\n<p>The two underclassmen have made their mark this year, combining for a total of 13 goals, eight assists and 36 points. The two landed Big West honors this past Tuesday with Hromatko being named to the First Team All-Big West and Ball to the Second Team.</p>\n<p>However, Hromatko and Ball have not been the only sources of production in the Gauchos’ success. Stumpf accredits his young group along with the leadership of upperclassmen’s supporting the team’s ability to compete at a high level.</p>\n<p>“[This team] has surprised us in how savvy they are tactically,” Stumpf said. “We can make an adjustment at half and with no practice time they are able to implement them into the game … I guess I have a little more confidence in this young team because they have just found ways to win.”</p>\n<p>The mixture of youth and experience has been a vital element in the Gauchos’ progression to the postseason. Along with Hromatko and Ball, six total players were selected to an All-Big West Team including freshman Jessica Parque, freshman Sydney Magnin, sophomore midfielder Chace Schornstein and junior defender Sydney Fuertes.</p>\n<p>“We owe a lot of our success to the older players because if they weren’t so welcoming to us freshmen, I don’t think our chemistry would be the same as it is right now,” Hromatko said. “It’s a group effort every time we step out on the field and the individual stats are not even a factor.”</p>\n<p>The keys to victory are simple for UCSB this Thursday: polish the team fundamentals they have been working on all season, and build from the positives of last week’s win against Fullerton.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we have to change [our] play at all against [Fullerton], we just have to continue what we have been doing,” Hromatko said. “We need to build off our play in the second half against them because we were able to connect more once we realized how their formations worked.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will open up its first Big West Tournament match at Titan Stadium Thursday night. Kickoff against Fullerton will commence at 7:30 p.m. While this is yet another challenge for this young team, they understand the importance of embracing the moment and not letting it slip away from them.</p>\n<p>“Our goal [this year] was to make it to the Big West Tournament,” Hromatko said. “So now it’s just about leaving everything you have out on the field because you never know when it could be our last game … we are going to come out strong Thursday and play for each other like we have been all season long.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 5, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/gauchos-head-into-postseason-with-no-2-seed/","id":1461,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1460,1459,1458],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sneaks Past CSFU With 1-0 Victory, Come Up Short in Overtime at CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WomensSoccer_ChristinaDeMarzo_10-25-15_6-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"After a critical 1-0 win over Cal State Fullerton on Thursday, it was an admirable comeback attempt by UCSB's women's soccer team in its 4-3 loss to Cal State Northridge.

Matching up against its biggest competition in hunt of the Big West title, Santa Barbara headed into Titan Stadium to face the top-ranked team in the conference in Cal State Fullerton. With both teams hosting a conference record of 5-1 in the Big West, this defensively charged match kept the two southern California squads scoreless for the first 77 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were deprived of offensive opportunities in the first half as they were held to two corner kicks and one shot on goal. Santa Barbara’s best chance at a goal came off a corner kick in the 37<sup>th</sup> minute by senior forward Savannah Francis.</p>\n<p>The fourth year from La Mirada, CA sent the ball high towards the middle of the goal box looking for her teammates but had her shot attempt snatched in mid-air by Fullerton’s redshirt junior goalkeeper Jennifer Stuart, which would be her only save of the day.</p>\n<p>The Titans controlled the majority of the match racking up nine of their total 15 shots in the first half. Redshirt senior forward Rebecca Wilson led the way accounting for seven shots on goal. Wilson has emerged as one of the conference’s elite scorers, knocking in a league best 16 goals on the year. The former Big West Player of the Year polled in six scores during the month of October, including a season-high three goals in the Titan’s 4-0 blowout over Hawaii October 11<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>Heading into the second half, the score remained at a stalemate until an opportunity presented itself in the 77<sup>th</sup> minute for UCSB sophomore forward Amanda Ball. Freshman forward Mallory Hromatko found Ball down the right flank nearing the penalty box and delivered a touch pass to her teammate. With a defender right on her back, Ball made one inside cut past a diving Stuart and launched a go-ahead goal in to the bottom left of the net.</p>\n<p>Ball’s third goal since coming off of injury couldn’t have been at a better time as it handed her team the 1-0 victory. Her score helped end Stuart’s unbeaten streak of 11 games this year.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Beth Ritter played a pivotal role in Thursday’s contest, recording a season-high eight saves to shutout the Titan’s high-powered offense. Fullerton came into the match with 38 goals on the year, the most by any team in the conference.</p>\n<p>Since taking over for junior goalkeeper Jacq Caginia in their match against Long Beach State, Ritter has been the anchor on defense for UCSB. She has won seven of her eight previous starts.</p>\n<p>While it chipped away at Cal State Northridge’s early lead in Sunday’s match, UCSB came up short in its season finale. After trailing 3-0 by the end of the first half, Head Coach Paul Stumpf and his team made some adjustments, influencing the Gauchos’ aggressive attack in the second period. Attempting to spoil the Matadors’ Senior Night, UCSB scored three goals in the 57<sup>th</sup>, 64<sup>th</sup>, and 68<sup>th</sup> minute to tie the game up 3-3 and send it into overtime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s first score came off the foot of freshman midfielder Maddie Gibson. Gibson gave that offensive spark that the Gauchos were desperately searching for, lining up to the left of the goal box about 25 yards out and sending it in the back of the net. This was Gibson’s first score of her collegiate career, putting UCSB on the board with the score 1-3.</p>\n<p>The freshman midfielder was not done yet as Hromatko connected with Gibson in the 64<sup>th</sup> minute off a cross inside the box. Gibson was in the right place at the right time, redirecting a header past senior goalkeeper Cynthia Tafoya for the 2-3 score.</p>\n<p>With the Matadors on their heels and the momentum on UCSB’s side, Ball took matters into her own hands in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute running from about 15 yards out and launching a line drive past a diving Tafoya for the 3-3 equalizer.</p>\n<p>Sending the match into extra minutes, the Gauchos looked to be the favorites during the first moments of overtime but could not capitalize on their attacks. After three corner kicks and a shot on goal by Hromatko in the 91<sup>st</sup> minute, the match ultimately came down to a penalty kick for CSUN by junior midfielder Kourtney Kutscher.</p>\n<p>Kutscher lined up for a one on one versus Ritter and sneaked a shot past the veteran goalkeeper to win the game. The overtime score was her fifth goal on the year, sending her senior teammates home with a 4-3 victory.</p>\n<p>Despite starting the year with a 0-2-1 record, UCSB now holds the No. 2 seed in the Big West Tournament. With the regular season finished, the Gauchos shift their focus onto postseason play, advancing to their first Big West Tournament since 2009. UCSB’s rematch versus third-seeded Cal State Fullerton will take place on Thursday, Nov. 5th at Titan Stadium. The semifinal match will be broadcasted on ESPN3 with a start time of 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66019\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66019\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-01/ucsb-sneaks-past-csfu-with-1-0-victory-come-up-short-in-overtime-at-csun/","id":1460,"author":{"id":60,"name":"Elliot Thornton"},"related":[1459,1458,1457],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/60"}},"__N_SSG":true}
