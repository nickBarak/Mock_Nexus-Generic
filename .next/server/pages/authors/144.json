While Reyes was unable to attain her degree in Chican@ Studies due to financial reasons, the graduating Class of 2015 presented it to her posthumously. Friday’s event was planned to honor those who identify as trans and have been victims of violence of hate crimes, as well as those who have fought for justice and equality for the transgender community.</p>\n<p>Director of UCSB’s Resource Center for Sexual &amp; Gender Diversity David Whitman said violence towards the trans community is a symptom of the group’s marginalization in daily life.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully the trans day of remembrance at UCSB can humble students to realize that oftentimes, by just being who you are, you are at risk for losing your life,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>Whitman said the event will honor the memory of individuals who have fought against oppression.</p>\n<p>“For us to do this, it is to show that yes, number one, they matter, and number two, this is an injustice,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>According to Whitman, events like the one taking place Friday are infrequent either because they are not widely publicized in the media or individuals are unaware of the violence trans people face.</p>\n<p>“This is something to care about, that this is an issue in our country, in our world, and hopefully [attendees] would at least be considering more, how they can be thoughtful, helpful, supportive and more loving,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>Whitman said it is important to honor Zoraida because of her role in helping found La Familia de Colores, the only LGBTQ Chican@ organization on campus.</p>\n<p>“She created this space for people that identify in this intersection and they are feeling rightfully that it is their duty to always honor not just the founder of their group that continues to be a supportive place for Queer Chican@, trans-identified people, but also to highlight the broader issue of violence happening to trans people of color,” Whitman said.</p>\n<p>First-year psychology major Adriana Pedroza said she was inspired to advocate for marginalized groups when she attended the Trans Revolution talk featuring trans-activist Jennicet Gutierrez in November.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people don’t know about the transgender community and [that] having a day to support them allows the UCSB community to stand in solidarity and honor those who have been oppressed just for being themselves,” Pedroza said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Sabrina Delgado said there needs to be more leaders in the UCSB community to spread awareness about the violence trans people face.</p>\n<p>“I think the people who don’t talk about this group are not educated or are unaware of the struggles transgender people face, so attending this event on Friday to learn more about the transgender community is a way of showing that you care,” Delgado said.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Juan Villalobos said honoring those affected by transgender violence validates their struggle.</p>\n<p>“People still have the mentality that it’s a choice if you identify within a LGBTQ group, and it’s kind of sad that others aren’t aware of the discrimination they deal with,” Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

On Thursday, Gutierrez will speak on her continued work campaigning for LGBTQ rights and her role as a founding member of Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ and Latin@ communities.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Ricardo Uribe said students should attend Gutierrez’s talk because the LGBTQ community is often poorly represented by the media.</p>\n<p>“I figured that it is kind of important to hear the stories and learn the other side about people who are not being spoken about or not being represented in the media in order to learn more about their struggles,” Uribe said.</p>\n<p>First-year computer engineering major Melanie Flandes said Gutierrez is an empowering leader who, by sharing her story and experiences, can motivate others to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“There are not a lot of people I feel would stand up to the president like that, and for her to have the courage and the ability to do that really does make a difference because now people are going to feel like their voices are being heard,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>Flandes said Gutierrez coming to UCSB will empower underrepresented communities on campus.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing and learning about her story and how these issues [have] impacted her life gives hope that a difference can be made,” Flandes said.</p>\n<p>First-year political science major Eriko Spurlock said she will attend Gutierrez’s talk in part because she of how much she learned from hearing LGBTQ activist CeCe McDonald speak in October as part of the Trans Revolution Series.</p>\n<p>“I found that these events were helpful in increasing my understanding for the experiences other marginalized women go through, especially since we all have different struggles that we each face based on different factors,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said she thinks students should attend Gutierrez’s lecture to learn more about the issues the LGBTQ community face.</p>\n<p>“I feel this event is important for students to come out to in order to open their eyes and gain more understanding for the society, the constructs we live in, and how the current power dynamics are made to marginalize so many people in collectively various ways,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>Spurlock said although the topics of immigration and LGBTQ rights are often discussed separately, it is important to see the connection between the two.</p>\n<p>“Immigration and LGBTQAP+ issues on their own are very important to learn more about and understand, but a lot of people think that these two topics are mutually exclusive when the reality is that everything is connected a lot more than we think they are,” Spurlock said in an email.</p>\n<p>First-year sociology major Gabriela Flores said she is looking forward to hearing Gutierrez speak, especially after seeing Shane Ortega, the first openly transgender soldier in the United States military, speak in October, also a part of the Trans Revolution series.</p>\n<p>“I recently attended the one where Shane Ortega came out to speak about his experience as the first openly trans man in the U.S. military, and since I learned a lot from that event, I decided to attend the next one,” Flores said.</p>\n<p>Flores said students should learn more about marginalized communities and support their fight for equality.</p>\n<p>“People need to start paying attention to things like this because these discrimination crimes are only increasing,” Flores said. “We are hurting people in our community by not fighting by their side or hearing them out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Greek chapters’ members are required to meet a quarterly minimum of three accreditation meetings. Forum keynote speaker and fourth-year economics and sociology double major Siavash Zohoori spoke about how society’s expectations of masculinity can be harmful to men by making them feel entitled to women’s bodies which can lead to sexual assault. Attendees were able to publically share their opinions and experiences afterwards in a mediated safe space.</p>\n<p>According to Zohoori, men who do not adhere to society’s expectations of masculinity can suffer “inner turmoil.” Zohoori said the concept of traditional masculinity affected Elliott Rodgers, the 22-year-old <em>Santa Barbara City College</em> student responsible for the death of six UC Santa Barbara students.</p>\n<p>After recounting his experience of being present at the scene of one of the shootings on May 23 last year, Zohoori said it is crucial for students to foster a better future by encouraging positive gender roles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65861\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"146885196\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65881\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65861\" data-attachment-id=\"65861\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/frats-address-sexual-assault-masculinity-issues/ifc_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D750\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445898323\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"90\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IFC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65861\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><em>“</em>I don’t want anyone to be a victim to anything that caused what happened to me, whether its sexual assault, shootings, being beat up or violence between men,” Zohoori said. “I don’t want anyone to be a victim of any issues with masculinity the same way I was or in any comparable way.”</p>\n<p>Zohoori said he mediated the event to allow participants to safely share their experiences without getting “lectured” about the specifics of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I called them out when I needed to, and I supported them. They feel comfortable and we actually got somewhere — we started a good conversation,” Zohoori said. “I’m not here to scold them, I’m not here to tell them what sexual assault is because they all know what it is, they just don’t know how they play a role in it.”</p>\n<p>Zohoori said society should support men who do not identify with traditional expectations of masculinity, rather than judge them.</p>\n<p>“The next step is to stop blaming issues with the men, with mental health, and realize that if we keep shit-talking about something, we are not actually going to get the space to support it,” Zohoori said. “The next step is to actually start supporting the people who we feel need it, who we feel like we are blaming, and actually start supporting these communities.”</p>\n<p>IFC President and fourth-year French and philosophy double-major Gregory Rousso said other accreditation meetings have discussed topics such as hazing, alcohol and drug abuse.</p>\n<p>“It’s really a chance to have your whole fraternity there and absorb the information, and seeing that we are all in this together — we are a Greek community,” Rousso said.</p>\n<p>Rousso said he was impressed by the number of fraternity chapters and members who attended the meeting.</p>\n<p>“We expect 75 percent of all membership to be here and we had a pretty impressive turnout here,” Rousso said. “I think having the majority of every fraternity is huge because, at the end of the day, it comes out of the culture within each house.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_65860\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1349893753\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"65881\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-65860\" data-attachment-id=\"65860\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-28/frats-address-sexual-assault-masculinity-issues/ifc_by-lorenzo-basilio-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D750\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1445898302\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IFC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-65860\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IFC_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-65860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Hechler said sexual assault is the biggest problem for fraternities nationwide.</p>\n<p>“I thought the first step had to be to get everyone to know about what is happening, then we can educate them from there,” Hechler said.</p>\n<p>Kappa Sigma President and fifth-year history major Fady Antoun said it is important for fraternity members to be educated on the issue of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“As a leader of one of these organizations, I feel it’s important because it is an issue that’s been rampant through our community not just this year or last year, but for all the years that Greeks have been around,” Antoun said.</p>\n<p>Antoun said he appreciated Zohoori’s honesty during the discussion.</p>\n<p>“He actually spilled out his heart up there,” Antoun said. “I know my fraternity and myself we are all about the honesty.

from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. at the Multicultural Center (MCC) to contribute to the third annual Dia de los Muertos celebration at the Santa Barbara Bowl on Oct. 30.</p>\n<p>Dia de los Muertos, or “Day of the Dead,” is a Mexican celebration to honor departed loved ones and assist their spiritual journey. The Altares Workshop, organized by graduate student Rosie Bermudez, will give participants the opportunity to create paper flowers, framed photographs and altars for remembrance. The altars, or “altares,” are decorated tributes to the deceased made of photographs, food and other meaningful items. The Santa Barbara Bowl celebration will begin at 4 p.m. and will showcase music from contemporary Latin bands and DJs, theatre and dance performances, art installations and altars made by local organizations, schools and museums.</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies and Chican@ studies double major Carmen Mares said while Dia de los Muertos is celebrated in parts of Latin America, it is centralized in Central and Southern Mexico.</p>\n<p>“Dia de los Muertos reminds us that death is a natural part of the human life and if a form of passage to the after-life,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>According to Mares, the student-created altars will also be displayed at the Santa Barbara Casa De La Raza and UCSB Educational Opportunity Program’s “Celebracion De la Gente” event.</p>\n<p>“Altares are constructed with candles, photographs, food and items that the deceased person loved in life,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year Chican@ studies major Nayeli Maldonado said during Dia de Los Muertos, loved ones visit cemeteries, construct altares and cook traditional dishes for the deceased.</p>\n<p>Maldonado said she began celebrating Dia de los Muertos after volunteering at the event last year.</p>\n<p>“I’ve come to realize how important it is to share it with my community and continue to pay my respects to my family members that have passed away,” Maldonado said. “It is a way to commemorate our ancestors, thank them for the wisdom they shared and keep their memory alive.”</p>\n<p>Maldonado said she was amazed by how much detail is involved in the event.</p>\n<p>“We decorate the venue, make beautiful and intricate altares, have giant calavera ‘skull’ puppets, free face painting, Aztec dancers, mariachi, art installments and much more,” Maldonado said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Sabrina Delgado said she has never participated in the Dia de los Muertos event and is excited to be part of the Chican@ experience.</p>\n<p>“Since I have never been to this kind of event, I am really excited to finally be able to be part of something that unifies the community through music and art to honor the dead,” Delgado said.</p>\n<p>Delgado said although her parents are Mexico natives, she did not grow up celebrating Dia de los Muertos and wants to learn more about the holiday’s significance.</p>\n<p>“My family has never celebrated this event as much as other individuals do,” Delgado said. “I am looking forward to this new experience and [to being] more in touch with my culture and [celebrating] this beautiful event with others.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

School workshop Thursday evening in the Dolores Huerta Conference Room to share information on the resources available to first generation, underrepresented students pursuing graduate education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ Studies Department peer advisors Carmen Mares and Beatriz Cano geared the workshop toward students of color, providing information about the application process to obtain a master’s degree or a Ph.D. The presentations provided an overview about applying for financial aid, studying for the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) and making connections with faculty members to get into a desired graduate program. Current graduate students discussed potential routes to graduate school and personal circumstances which motivated them to continue their education.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-year Chican@ studies and Black studies double major Veronica Mandujano said she was compelled to attend this workshop because she does not know anyone who has gone to graduate school prior to the workshop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just want to know every resource available to me,” Mandujano said. “I want to know who I can link up with, and who can offer me information when I need it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandujano said the workshop offered several resources for attendees, including information about fellowships, paying for grad school and out-of-state schooling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a great presentation and I learned a lot but mainly planning ahead, planning as much as much as you can … and the different types of grad schools that are available,” Mandujano said. “Speaking to current grad students was just kind of a more personal time to understand their experience.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies teaching assistant Terri Cecchine said she went through the same experiences and felt it was her responsibility to relay information about the graduate school process to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am the first in my family to pursue a Ph.D., to receive a masters, so when I was approached by Carmen and Betty, of course I wanted to help out,” Cecchine said. “I have to help those that are following in the path that I have carved out for myself, it’s not easy for everyone to get here and so now that we are here, it’s really important that we network and give back, and give our wisdom.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cecchine, a low percentage of minority students acquire Ph.D.’s due to financial and social circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like it’s really hard given the obstacles that a lot of people of color are born into – the lack of resources, lack of network, lack of peer support and lack of parental support,” Cecchine said. “For whatever reason, all of those things are prominent in white communities or communities that don’t have financial stipulations, so they are obviously given a lot more access to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Carmen Mares said she held the workshop because she would like more guidance in applying to graduate school, and felt many other students were in the same position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a peer advisor here has helped me provide resources to other students, especially students that are Latino, Chicano that are first generation,” Mares said. “That’s a goal as a peer advisor to help other students like me that don’t really know what their career goals are at the moment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chican@ studies department peer advisor Beatriz Cano said her main goal was to reach out to first-generation students upon becoming a peer advisor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[My goal is] to reach out to Chicanos, to let them know that they weren’t alone, they didn’t have to struggle,” Cano said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cano said she wanted to host the workshop because she was struggling to find resources to aid her graduate school application process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am pretty sure that people are interested in grad school and are struggling as bad as we are and so the purpose of this workshop is for us to help them and to help ourselves, to create this community,” Cano said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

They planned the most recent meeting as a follow-up for those interested in joining a UCSB-based movement for stricter gun control. The group will meet again next week to discuss gun reform at the local level.</p>\n<p>Armbruster said while he believes people need time to “express their emotions” following events such as the Umpqua Community College shooting, the UCSB community needs to come together to discuss what action should be taken to advocate for stricter gun control.</p>\n<p>“I think you do need time to process, mourn and cry,” Armbruster said. “On the other hand, after you do that, there needs to be something else.”</p>\n<p>Armbruster said the pro-gun lobby has prevented gun control reform laws through “distorting” the word “freedom” and the American ideal surrounding it.</p>\n<p>“That buzzword, the discourse of just that one word, I think is so captivating, that they did a really fine job in trying to convince people that somehow, someway gun control equals lack of freedom, lack of liberty,” Armbruster said.</p>\n<p>Armbruster also said while some argue guns provide owners with protection and safety, he believes the prevalence of guns in the United States causes “insecurity.”</p>\n<p>“You never know who might be walking around here and might open up on you,” Armbruster said. “I’d rather be in a situation where I knew UCSB is gun free.”<br>\nFirst-year psychology major Jackie Rodriguez said it “frustrates” her that people in supposedly safe places, like schools, can be in danger of mass shootings.<br>\n“Like the kids from Sandy Hook, they didn’t get to have a boyfriend or girlfriend, they didn’t get to learn how to ride a bike, they didn’t get to do stuff like that,” Rodriquez said. “If I can do anything to fix that for my own children when I get older then that’s what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology and history double major Katie Jacobson said she was pleased with the turnout at the meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice that other people came, it wasn’t as large as the vigil but there was people who still showed up,” Jacobson said. “It was nice to hear from people that they were also sharing the same ideas that we need to do something.”</p>\n<p>Irvine said he is glad undergraduates came to the meeting to get involved because he enjoys working with them and serving as a “resource.”</p>\n<p>“They are about as bitter and jaded as I am already, but they just care,” Irvine said. “They are so passionate and I really love being around them and I love providing my knowledge.”</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Willey Campbell said he attended last week’s vigil to “pay his respects” to the victims of the shooting, but the event inspired him to engage in the gun-control movement.</p>\n<p>“Just seeing the impact that it had on everyone here made me want to come back and talk about how there should be more done about gun reforms,” Campbell said. “Having people that are very passionate about something like this that want to go out and make a change was something that was really motivating to me and something I wanted to be a part of especially as a first-year coming in.”</p>\n<p>The next meeting will be held this Thursday at 8 p.m. outside the SRB.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The apartments consist of several three-story buildings and 109 total apartment spaces with three varying floor plans. Parts of the complex are still under construction, including faculty housing and the administration and recreation buildings scheduled for completion in the next two to three weeks.</p>\n<p>Third-year feminist studies and sociology double major Kevin Tang said he was assigned to live in Sierra Madre; he enjoys living there and prefers it over his apartment at Santa Ynez last year.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t choose to live here; I got randomly assigned, but I like it a lot. It’s nice to have a new apartment and not have to share a shower with more than one person,” Tang said in an email. “I lived in Santa Ynez before and it definitely a lot nicer [here], especially the new appliances, also there’s a lot less ants.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Allie Lobos said she chose to live at Sierra Madre and though the new apartments are clean, she dislikes the 1.8 mile commute to campus.</p>\n<p>“Living here is great. It’s new, it’s clean, but I wish I did live in Isla Vista,” Lobos said. “My biggest complaint is the distance; I have three 8 a.m.s a week.”</p>\n<p>Tang said despite the distance, he would be willing to choose to live in Sierra Madre Village Apartments again.</p>\n<p>“It’s kind of far and taking the bus can be annoying when I miss it and become late for class, but I like it a lot and would choose to live here again,” Tang said again, in an email.</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major and transfer student Vanessa Guevara said she likes living farther from campus and closer to the supermarkets, and she is looking forward to the completion of the convenience store and recreational building.</p>\n<p>“I like how far it is; it feels more secluded from the main campus and it’s close to groceries,” Guevara said in an email. “I hope the store and gym opens soon though. I bike so it’s not really a problem and the living space is nice especially since it was just built.”</p>\n<p>Project Executive Joe Linden said the administration and recreation building will be completed in two to three weeks’ time, and until then students will be surrounded in a loud environment. Linden also said the faculty building which burned down July 4, 2014 is nearing completion.</p>\n<p>“Everything is on schedule but some community buildings still have about two weeks left,” Linden said. “Building seven which is located by Whittier and Storke Road has two to three weeks left as well.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Oct. 1 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64949\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64949\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/first-students-move-into-sierra-madre-villages/","id":2705,"author":{"id":144,"name":"Jonathan Mendez"},"related":[2704,2703,2702],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/144"}},"__N_SSG":true}
