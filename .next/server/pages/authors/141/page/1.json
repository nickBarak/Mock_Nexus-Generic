Nyad unsuccessfully attempted the swim four times starting at age 28, with the 2013 swim being her fifth attempt in 35 years.</p>\n<p>Nyad said she thought of Cuba as “an untouchable star with a simply irresistible mystique” throughout her childhood, early swimming career and time as a professional sports journalist and commentator.</p>\n<p>Nyad said the most difficult part of her swim to Havana was nighttime, when she experienced “total sensory deprivation.”</p>\n<p>“That second night I had no idea who I was or what I was doing.” Nyad said. “I thought the blackness would never end.”</p>\n<p>Nyad said accomplishments should be viewed in terms of personal development.</p>\n<p>“When you achieve your dreams, it’s not so much about what you get but the person you become,” Nyad said. “I don’t succeed at everything I do, but I’m living this wild and precious life of mine full throttle.”</p>\n<p>UCSB alumna Kristina Hill, who just completed an open-water swim from the Channel Islands to Oxnard, attended Nyad’s talk Saturday. Hill said she admires Nyad and was excited to learn she would be in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I’m just beginning to fall in love with this sport, and the fact that such an athletic and personal icon is here now in Santa Barbara is just awe-inspiring,” Hill said.</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major Julie Keller said the talk was “extremely motivating,” but people do not necessarily need to set goals of the same scale as Nyad’s.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to note that these methods of extreme accomplishments and larger-than-life goal setting are certainly not for everyone,” Keller said.</p>\n<p>Lisa Noack, a parent of a UCSB student, said she read Nyad’s book and appreciates the idea of valuing one’s journey over the final destination.</p>\n<p>“We’re trained to get to the next level at every stage of our life and think that reaching that certain level will make us happy,” Noack said. “While brief moments of accomplishment are sweet, we forget about the deep value within the difficult, long process of accomplishing our goals. Diana truly relishes in the significance of her work while achieving what she wants.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Lectures.</p>\n<p>Nyad will share how she completed the 110-mile swim from Cuba to Florida, the first person to do so without a protective shark cage. Nyad first attempted the feat at 28, but completed it in 2013 at the age of 64. Nyad is currently an author, public speaker and sports broadcaster who encourages people to pursue their dreams regardless of their age. Nyad’s TED Talk titled “Never, Ever Give Up” has more than three million views.</p>\n<p>UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures Program Manager Heather Silva said Nyad’s work as an athlete, as well as her being a member of the LGBTQ community, fits the UCSB “mantra.”</p>\n<p>“She has a profound appreciation for the outdoors, and is athletic and inspirational to all,” Silva said. “As a queer woman, she also represents the diversity we strive for at Arts &amp; Lectures at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Silva said the university has been considering hosting Nyad for years.<br>\n“After her big swim, we knew she would be a great fit for an event at UCSB,” Silva said.</p>\n<p>UCSB head swimming coach Greg Wilson said Nyad has pushed human limits as a swimmer.</p>\n<p>“In my 40 years I’ve trained a number of incredible long distance people. Not quite like Diana; she’s [swam] between countries,” Wilson said. “I’ve never met her but I have a built-in appreciation and wonder for what allows her to do these extraordinary things to the brink of human ability.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said Nyad’s commitment to perfection is essential to her accomplishments.</p>\n<p>“I endorse and completely subscribe to Diana’s philosophy of putting 100 percent into life in and out of the water,” Wilson said. “In anything a student or student athlete does, you need passion and full engagement to overcome adversity.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Marine Science Institute Director and project scientist Andrew Brooks said ocean wild life was the biggest threat to Nyad’s undertaking.</p>\n<p>“While the media plays up the shark issue, the most dangerous threat she faced were the jellyfish, and the Australian box jelly can easily be fatal,” Brooks said. “Dehydration from saltwater or simple sunburn, cramping and lack of energy would be things I automatically worry about.”<br>\nBrooks said Nyad’s long-distance swim between countries is “staggering.”</p>\n<p>“She accomplished something amazing and was able to push the limits of the human body,” Brooks said. “I think it certainly speaks to her mental ability and strength.”</p>\n<p>Third-year physical geography major Jack Sargent said that as someone who regularly surfs the California coast he appreciates Nyad’s ability to brave the elements to accomplish her goal.</p>\n<p>“Knowing the unending monotony of the ocean, I just cannot imagine that mental strain and physical strength required for over two days in the Florida straits,” Sargent said. “I’m really looking forward to hearing Diana’s story.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Campus Advocacy Resource and Education (C.A.R.E.) will host a booth at the event where participants can make t-shirts and practice asking for consent, and attendees will have the opportunity to sign a pledge for consent culture.</p>\n<p>O’Neal said educating students on consent culture is an important first step in preventing sexual violence on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our message is to actively practice it,” O’Neal said. “One in four girls being sexually assaulted while in college does not have to be the reality.”</p>\n<p>O’Neal said the demonstration aims to define consent and promote community participation in fighting rape culture.</p>\n<p>“Consent is active confirmation about engaging in sexual activity, and our goal is to teach what that means and the consequences of rape culture, taking steps toward replacing a culture of indifference about rape and replacing it with one of actively practicing consent,” O’Neal said.</p>\n<p>Barnett said ending rape culture must begin with individuals choosing to help end rape culture rather than “shrugging it off.”</p>\n<p>“Our generation is capable of making huge change, but it starts with the individual,” Barnett said. “Society tells us not to get raped instead of not to rape, and if I can inspire people to stand up for each other and their friends, then that is one step forward.”</p>\n<p>According to Barnett, the event will call on men to participate in fighting rape culture.</p>\n<p>“Getting men engaged and holding other men accountable for sexual assault is huge,” Barnett said. “We want men to stand with us as a powerful statement to further counteract slut-shaming and victim-blaming.”</p>\n<p>O’Neal said she hopes to build on the work of other organizations such as #nowUCsb by increasing community support for consent culture.</p>\n<p>“We are now working off of that to engage students on a more grassroots level,” O’Neal said.</p>\n<p>Graduate assistant at C.A.R.E. Sasha Coles said the event will call attention to rape culture in the days leading up to Halloween weekend.</p>\n<p>“People who go to the demonstration will be able to sign a pledge for consent culture, which is especially important with Halloween just around the corner,” Coles said.</p>\n<p>Coles said by promoting consent culture as a replacement for rape culture, the event will “reframe the conversations” about sexual violence prevention.</p>\n<p>“Rape culture tolerates, accepts and rationalizes rape, sexual assault and violence while mistrusting survivors,” Coles said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65800\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65800\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-27/activists-host-event-to-promote-consent-culture/","id":2647,"author":{"id":141,"name":"Ari Plachta"},"related":[2646,2645,2644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Gather in The Hub for First Democratic Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Debate_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Debate_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB-4-Bernie hosted a live screening of the first Democratic Presidential Debate of the 2016 race Tuesday evening in the Hub.
