Hosted by ABC, this near century-old event has only changed with its decline in relevance. The Oscars, in recent years, have become much more associated with their lack of recognition of underrepresented voices than its appreciation for cinema as a whole, which should only instill apathy for the award among their viewers. That being said, an Oscar award remains the highest honor that can be bestowed on a cast and crew for a film they have dedicated blood, sweat and tears to — which is enough motivation for me to write this article. But, before I actually talk about the movies that have been nominated, I want to recognize some films I happened to watch last year that are just as deserving as these other movies of acclaim.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>My Snub List, or Movies I Thought Deserved More:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Booksmart,” “The Lighthouse” (nominated only for cinematography), “High Life,” “Brittany Runs a Marathon,” “Midsommar,” “Motherless Brooklyn,” “Dark Waters,” “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” (nominated only for Best Supporting Actor), “Waves,” “Honey Boy,” “Uncut Gems,” “The Peanut Butter Falcon” and “Judy” (nominated only for Best Leading Actress)</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Big Hitters:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These are the usual suspects for insiders — the movies that have been getting buzz for months, especially the films that come out of the festival circuit, which are oftentimes the most nominated and likeliest winners of the night. Generally, these movies are propped up with a sort of pedigree, meaning that there are legacy names attached to them (a large part as to why people of color and women aren’t nominated as often). The big hitters this year are: “The Irishman,” “Marriage Story,” “1917,” “Parasite” and “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Irishman</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 10</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love this movie. It’s a perfect bookend to this era of Scorsese film — it’s an epic, it has some of the greatest American actors of all time and it perfectly captures how Marty’s perception of the rock-star gangster has evolved. The movie leaves you in a state of shocking pity in how you can feel so sad for such a terrible character and evokes debilitating fear for the isolation and oblivion that come with old age. It is long and can seem at times a little tedious to get through, but the ending affords all of that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve spoken with a friend of mine who is much better at predicting the Oscars than I am, and he says that this movie is going to get shut out. But I don’t happen to think so. This movie has the names, has the pedigree and has the quality behind its push. I don’t think it’s going to win a majority of the 10 Oscars it’s nominated for, but I think it has Best Director and Best Supporting Actor in the bag. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marriage Story</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 6</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92679\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"81920567\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92679\" data-attachment-id=\"92679\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/mcdmast-zx005/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?fit=2048%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MCDMAST ZX005\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?fit=888%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92679\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=888%2C444\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?resize=1536%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Today-Show.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another one of my favorites of the year, “Marriage Story” follows the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">initially amicable but soon-turned-ugly divorce between a theater director and an actress. It brilliantly portrays the reasoning, misconceptions and aggressions coming from both sides so that the viewer isn’t necessarily in between the two but understands where each side is coming from. It also unravels their marriage and compares it to their professional dynamic, one of the most interesting aspects of their marriage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is pretty locked in for the Oscars it’s going to win. Laura Dern has won nearly every significant award for her role leading up to the Oscars: the BAFTAs, the SAG award and the Golden Globe. I would consider her a guarantee for the Best Supporting Actress category. Where I think this movie is a tossup for a win in the Best Leading Actress category; Ren</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ée </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zellweger has swept in the preceding award shows, but her movie has lost a bit of momentum coming into the Oscars season. Personally, I think Scarlett Johansson is going to pick up Best Actress, but I’ll happily be wrong if Zellweger wins.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parasite</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 6 </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92681\" style=\"width: 1745px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"947269518\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92681\" data-attachment-id=\"92681\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/america-magazine/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?fit=1735%2C1057&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1735,1057\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"America Magazine\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?fit=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?fit=888%2C541&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92681\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=888%2C541\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?w=1735&amp;ssl=1 1735w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=250%2C152&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=1024%2C624&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=768%2C468&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/America-Magazine.jpg?resize=1536%2C936&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92681\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of America Magazine</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think this film is my favorite of 2019, and maybe one of my favorites of all time. It’s something I have never seen before — it’s daring, provocative and funny. There’s a shift in tone in this movie that coincides with a shift in the understanding of the overall framework of the narrative the family has spun. It is done masterfully and subtly, which is also strange considering how bonkers this movie really is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie’s chances for Sunday night are much less set in stone. It’s definitely winning in the Best Foreign Film category because it’s the only movie in that category to be nominated for Best Picture as well. I also think it’s a shoo-in for Best Original Screenplay, but this movie has the potential to be the first foreign film to ever win Best Picture. It would be a shame on so many levels if Best Picture went to anything else; this movie has been lauded by critics and audiences alike and would make a powerful statement about mainstream American cinema. I hope dearly this movie wins, but I have a growing suspicion that it won’t. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1917</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 10</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having seen this movie rather recently, I don’t understand why it has garnered as much attention and buzz as it has. It felt like a dollar store version of “Dunkirk” with the dialogue of a “Call of Duty” video game. I felt bored throughout the film, except for the three-minute running scene near the end, and could not wait for the credits to finally roll. It felt shallow and redundant in the context of the war genre, which contains some of the greatest films both cinematically and thematically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know what this movie is going to win — probably because I don’t like it very much. I think its best shot is for the cinematography work done by the prolific Roger Deakins. This movie has the momentum it needs; it has won Best Picture at nearly all of the significant awards preceding the Oscars. I hope it doesn’t win and would actually be quite mad if it does. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 10 </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92682\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"383852818\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92682\" data-attachment-id=\"92682\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/vox/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Vox\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92682\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Vox.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92682\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Vox</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a controversial take: I don’t get why this movie is nominated for Best Picture either. I like this movie, but I don’t love it. I appreciate the fact that Quentin Tarantino brought together a cast that was almost made for a reflection on stardom in Hollywood, and the cast did a fantastic job. I sort of separate the movie into three lenses, all of which have an interesting take on the situation at hand: the has-been, the never-was and the rising star. The core story at work is fascinating, but I just feel there’s too much fat around the interesting stuff for it to be amazing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, my opinion has absolutely no bearing on what’s going to win or lose, and there are a bunch of people who adore this movie. That being said, I don’t think this movie is going to win that many Oscars. I think the sure-fire bet is on Best Production Design; Tarantino recreated old Hollywood to a near-perfect degree (just look at the marquees as Margot Robbie walks into the theater). I think its second strongest bet is on Best Supporting Actor, even though I think Al Pacino is taking it for “The Irishman,” because Brad Pitt has been sweeping in the award shows leading up. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>The Nods: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would consider these movies the dark horses of the race. These are the unsung heroes of the Oscars; they often show up for the nomination and go home empty-handed. It’s not impossible that these movies will win, just improbable — and I’d love to see it. Without any type of recognition for these cinematic darlings, the Oscars would look even more pointless in the eyes of cinephiles than they already do. For me, this year’s nods are “Jojo Rabbit,” “Little Women” and “Ford v. Ferrari.” </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jojo Rabbit</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 6</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92683\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"660162980\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92683\" data-attachment-id=\"92683\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/variety-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?fit=1000%2C563&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,563\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Variety\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Variety.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92683\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I don’t love “Jojo Rabbit” as much as some other people, it should 100% be on display at this award ceremony.

But “Little Women” doesn’t simply retread the past; Gerwig reimagines the story by jumping between multiple time points instead of sticking to chronological order. Even as she changes the source material, she remains true to the heart of the story, and the spirit of the March sisters shines like it never has before onscreen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gerwig could possibly take the award for best adapted screenplay, but the only expected win is for Jacqueline Durran for costume design. Saoirse Ronan (Jo March) and Florence Pugh (Amy March) both delivered top-notch performances for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. But in a particularly competitive year, it would be a (pleasant) shock if either took home the prize. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ford v Ferrari</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — Number of Oscar nominations this year: 4</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92685\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1673136994\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92648\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92685\" data-attachment-id=\"92685\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-09/a-rundown-of-this-years-oscar-noms-whos-going-to-win/grist/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,576\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Grist\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-92685\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grist.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92685\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Merrick Morton / 20th Century Fox</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ford v Ferrari” is a straightforward popcorn flick that was an absolute joy to watch. It was one of my favorites from last year, with Christian Bale and Matt Damon absolutely killing it in their respective roles. However, I don’t expect it to win much beyond a few technical categories like sound and editing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The point of the Oscars is to appreciate cinema and for some reason we’ve decided as a culture that a trophy, plaque or a certificate is the best way to recognize different achievements. There is nothing wrong with symbols of gratitude, and in a lot of ways these symbols are soothing because they’re unequivocal — you won the Oscar for the category you were nominated for. Yet still, there have been many films that have won Best Picture that couldn’t matter less to me. If I were to create something (which I hope to someday), I would want to leave an imprint on the audience, because the ideas that I would bake into what I create mean something to me — and it means something to me that those ideas mean something to the people watching. So when you watch a movie, let it wash over you — give it meaning, because these awards don’t. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed to the

the release of “Zombieland: Double Tap.” Because of the first movie’s charm, its satire on the zombie genre, its simple but poignant plot and most importantly, its funny jokes, one would think that its sequel would at least share some of those qualities, if not all. Well, I’m sorry to say — it doesn’t. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The core cast from the first film remains intact: Jesse Eisenberg as the geeky but lovable Columbus, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as the independent survivalists Wichita and Little Rock and Woody Harrelson, who dusts off his old cowboy boots as Tallahassee, the gruff, callous father figure of the group. The fact that this movie takes inspiration from its predecessor’s character development is not necessarily a bad thing, but “Zombieland: Double Tap” works to reiterate themes from the first movie at a greater frequency without any sort of progression or subtlety. It was frustrating to see these characters go through the exact same journey to reach the very same conclusion, which begs the question: why was this movie made?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of the journey, the plot revolves around Little Rock, who’s experiencing the inevitable desire to be around people her age as a young adult. In meeting a person on the road with her sister, she decides to run away from her newfound family and home. The remaining three tenuously team up to bring her back, running into a gaggle of similar survivors. This is where the movie succeeds — it pads its short runtime with funny cameos and ancillary characters. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new characters that showed a rather outstanding performance included the empty-headed Madison (Zoey Deutch) and Albuquerque (Luke Wilson), who does his best to spoof Tallahassee. The chemistry between the main cast is given a much-needed jolt with the introduction of these characters that essentially alter how the core four interact with each other. Madison acts as a wrench in Columbus and Wichita’s relationship, which has been strained already by circumstances that I have deemed spoiler territory. If they had to solely mend the rift created at the beginning of the movie, any conflict would have seemed forced as Wichita’s decision to return to Columbus was wholly transparent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, that is where the positives to this movie end, because by far the most important thing about comedies is where this movie falls flat: its humor. I do not understand how the writing team from the first film could not write fresher jokes. Their take on the zombie genre in the first film seemed rather novel in 2009. But, in 2019, those same jokes have come to be stale which isn’t helped by the fact that several recurring gags in this movie are recycled from the first one. And the new gags, of which there are few, are so boring and nonsensical that they actually seem to halt the movie’s plot. Whenever this movie would cut to a “Kill of the Year” contender snippet, I would first ask myself how they came to learn about this event, and why the bit was five agonizing minutes long. The movie frequently returns to Columbus’ rules for an easy joke, which again felt fresh and new… 10 years ago. To reach down into that well as many times as they did in this movie will leave most audience members loathing the next time they have to hear a joke about Eisenberg doing cardio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, “Zombieland: Double Tap” is a movie that has no imprint on any level. The box office will forget this movie in a week; you will forget this movie in the same time, which is incredibly disappointing having loved the first movie for a decade. That being said, this movie is inoffensive to taste. If you desperately want to watch a movie that you don’t have to think about with a couple friends, you won’t hate yourself for watching this one. Maybe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SCORE: 4/10 </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/zombieland-double-tap-someone-should-have-double-tapped-this-franchise/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/zombieland-double-tap-someone-should-have-double-tapped-this-franchise/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/zombieland-double-tap-someone-should-have-double-tapped-this-franchise/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/zombieland-double-tap-someone-should-have-double-tapped-this-franchise/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/zombieland-double-tap-someone-should-have-double-tapped-this-franchise/","id":5741,"author":{"id":768,"name":"Devin Himatsinghani"},"related":[5740,5739,5738],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/768"}},"__N_SSG":true}
