I was only 17 and still heavily invested in my indie and alternative roots, with bands like Arcade Fire and MGMT topping my personal list of must-see acts. As a young and naive festival-goer, I wasn’t too keen on checking out acts I was unfamiliar with. Nonetheless, I found myself with a gap between sets toward the end of Day 1 and decided to make the most of my time. So, I made my way to the nearest tent closest tent near me to pass the time.</p>\n<p>I found myself aimlessly stumbling into the darker and more intimate setting of Coachella’s Gobi Tent. It was then that I was introduced to Flume, hearing his track “Sleepless” for the first time. I had no idea who he was and had only managed to figure out his name after looking at my little booklet of set times, but what I do know is that whatever I was hearing, I liked it. I was instantly mesmerized by every weird and unfamiliar bit of sound I heard, so much so that I remained there for the next 30 minutes of his set.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“What is this?” I asked myself.</p>\n<p>Five years later and Flume has just released his newest project, Hi This Is Flume, a 17-track mixtape touting features from KUČKA, Eprom, JPEGMAFIA, SOPHIE, HWLS and slowthai and accompanied by a 42-minute-long visualizer directed by Jonathan Zawada. The Australian record producer, musician and DJ took to Instagram and Twitter earlier this month to announce the project, releasing it only a day laterin only a days time and breaking a painstaking two-year silence that has lasted since the release of the second companion EP to his Grammy award-winning album Skin in 2017.</p>\n<p>Flume, also known as Harley Streten, is notorious for consistently branching out into uncharted territory when it comes to his production. He is a pioneer in experimental electronic music and is largely responsible for launching the “future-bass” sound that dominates much of the mainstream music now. His sound design is an innovative and genre-blending mesh of sounds that one may not have ever heard before.</p>\n<p>Following his widely acclaimed Skin album in 2016, it’s hard to imagine how Flume could expand upon the weirdly alluring obscurities that make up his signature sound. When all has been watched and listened to, however, it’s evident that his newest project, Hi This Is Flume, stands as an even bigger career-defining moment in the scope of all things Flume.</p>\n<p>To my 17-year-old self, I’d confidently say, “This is Flume.”</p>\n<p>The mixtape opens up with an introductory “Hi, this is Flume” sample and transitions into a track titled “Ecdysis,” which quite literally is the process of shedding old skin among reptiles and insects. Metaphorically, this opening signals Flume’s own shedding of his “skin” — the evident narrative throughout the mixtape and visualizer. It’s a narrative of growth and moving forward, reaching newer and higher grounds.</p>\n<p>Filled with retro and hypnotic graphics among expansive landscapes, the visualizer accompanying the mixtape helps to guide audiences through this narrative journey Flume embarkssets out on. It’s psychedelic and trippy and helps accentuate every feature of the mixtape and its seamless transitions from track to track.</p>\n<p>Standout tracks in the first half include “Jewel” and “Dreamtime.” Both are somewhat reminiscent of the sounds in Flume’s prior work, particularly those in the two companion EPs to Skin. They’re nostalgic in nature and indicative of the mellow flow and glitchy sounds that helped propel Flume into the global spotlight, but still with new and heavier twists to them. The first run of tracks culminate in Flume and Eprom’s remix of SOPHIE’s “Is It Cold In The Water?” and builds on SOPHIE’s already ethereal and hyperreal sound.</p>\n<p>After several minutes of following Flume in his tie-dye kimono on his trek through the desert, the mixtape and visualizer pauses with a three-minute silence during which he is seen pumping gas late at night at an empty gas station. Then, it immediately transitions into “How To Build a Relationship,” featuring a strong and powerful verse from rapper JPEGMAFIA.</p>\n<p>This is where the real action of the project picks up — even fresher and newer sounds are poured into this side of the tape. “Wormhole,” for instance, is the most telling of all in terms of Flume’s growth and experimentation as a producer. It presents to listeners a seemingly random conglomeration of almost unbearable, loud noises until it bleeds into “Voices,” with appearances from SOPHIE and KUČKA. In “Voices,” we hear the same bashing of sounds, although in a much more fascinating way that’s layered beneath the vocals.</p>\n<p>“MUD” and “Upgrade” follow these tracks as an even more impressive pair of the strangely entrancing mixture of sounds Flume uses in his productions.<br>\nBut perhaps the best run of tracks is the 10 or so minutes engulfed by Tracks 13-17, from “71m3” to “Spring.” The visualizer shows Flume seeing double of himself, driving in circles and even burying himself in the sand. It’s a psychedelic realization and rebirth, quite literally depicted in this part of the visualizer and through the wonky, hard-soft melodies that bring these tracks together.</p>\n<p>In the end, Hi This Is Flume speaks true to its name. This is what Flume is. It’s the raw and organic feeling of hearing a sound for the very first time. It’s the discovery of something new — something you never knew you needed, until you did. It’s that feeling my 17-year-old self was overcome by when hearing the oddities of Flume’s production for the very first time and being strangely drawn to it because of its fresh and authentic nature.</p>\n<p>Hi This Is Flume is a mesmerizing testament to the process of discovery, growth and continuation. Whether it be in his personal life or creative processes, Flume is, and continues to be, a confident stride into the unknown. His originality as a producer is quite possibly what leads others to flock to his side, and not knowing what will come next perpetually leaves fans on their toes.</p>\n<p>What has always fascinated me about the electronic music genre is how electronic artists and producers are continually able to push the musical landscape, challenging traditional conceptions of what music is and what it ought to sound like. Throughout his career and especially through his new project, Flume has exemplified this to a tee, proving that music can and should be a continually progressive phenomenon.</p><div

SG Lewis, first debuted in Santa Barbara with a DJ set in The Hub. Last Wednesday night marked his return, although this time the 24-year-old <span class=\"s1\">performed </span>a brand new live show and brought an arsenal of new tunes with him, showcasing <span class=\"s1\">just</span> how far his music <span class=\"s1\">has progressed in a single year</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">The show was set against dark brick walls that define SOhO Restaurant &amp; Music Club’s industrial interior in downtown Santa Barbara. On stage was a basic five-piece band setup that sat atop a large, intricately designed carpet, dimly lit by a chilling mixture of blue and green lights. It was an effortless and simple design, but alluring <span class=\"s1\">nonetheless</span> <span class=\"s1\">—</span> one that sp<span class=\"s1\">oke</span> well to Lewis’<span class=\"s1\">s </span>style of electronic music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Walking inside the venue, I noticed that the initial energy and excitement for Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>show seemed lacking. For <span class=\"s1\">nearly </span>an hour, people lingered between aRod’s opening set and the bar, although most hovered around the bar until <span class=\"s1\">right </span>before Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s</span> performance. Perhaps the Wednesday night drink specials distracted from the usual pre-show excitement but, regardless, as soon as the lights shut off and the infectious build-up of “Coming Up” started playing, the energy flipped.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">“Coming Up” was one of two singles released from Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s</span> <i>Dusk</i> EP, which came out earlier this year in April. The EP is the first component of Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>much-anticipated debut album, <i>Dusk, Dark, Dawn</i>, a three-part, 18-track series with each part being <span class=\"s1\">set to release</span> separately.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Inspired by Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>history and fascination with U.K. club culture, each part of the album attempts to relay the distinctive moods, sounds and energies that make up different phases of a typical night out. First <span class=\"s1\">come </span>the feelings of anticipation and excitement for what’s to come<span class=\"s1\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">then</span> the sort of high-energy peak felt at the top of the night and<span class=\"s1\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">finally,</span> the downtempo comedown that follows that energy.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>show last week served as an introductory experience to the musical expression of synerg<span class=\"s1\">y</span> between every different phase of a night out. Even on a Wednesday night, by curating a set that sonically builds, peaks and <span class=\"s1\">subsequently </span>comes back down<span class=\"s1\">, Lewisb guided </span>audience members through the exact journey of emotion and energy that inspired his upcoming album.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Transitioning from “Coming Up” into some of his upbeat tracks like “All Night” and “Better” (<span class=\"s1\">featuring</span> rising electropop star Clairo) solidified the vibe of the first phase. As more people crowded closer to the stage, it was evident that excitement was rising <span class=\"s1\">as </span>each song played. Needless to say, the previously off-putting <span class=\"s1\">atmosphere that filled the club </span>no longer existed in the presence of Lewis, who was accompanied by two other instrumentalists and a captivating duo of vocalists.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Then, songs with heavier overtones like “Times We had” and “Smart Aleck Kill” <span class=\"s1\">furthered the crowd’s excitement and</span> <span class=\"s1\">brought </span>them closer to t<span class=\"s1\">he</span> peak energy level that Lewis likely wanted<span class=\"s1\">. In order to maintain that level of enthusiasm, he dropped</span> his most recent banger, “Hurting,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> with fellow Brit AlunaGeorge. <span class=\"s1\">A</span>t this point <span class=\"s1\">in</span> the night, the room was noticeably hotter, people were sweatier and the crowd was moving more groovily than ever.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But, a return to the slow magic of Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>signature sound <span class=\"s1\">was </span>what truly <span class=\"s1\">tied</span> th<span class=\"s1\">is whole</span> sonic experience together. Lewis<span class=\"s1\">’s </span>sound is deeply mellow and introspective. It’s moody, minimal and full of synth — but also commanding<span class=\"s1\"> and</span> strong.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">His style<span class=\"s1\"> differentiates him from</span> the higher BPMs usually associated with EDM and, even more so, from the headbanging trap, bumpy house and tir<span class=\"s1\">i</span>ng future bass that currently dominates most electronic scenes. However, <span class=\"s1\">he has proved that </span>this does not make his music any less danceable or invigorating. In fact, it’s what landed him alongside U.K. powerhouse names like Disclosure and Jessie Ware at PMR Records in the first place.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">What is so interesting about<span class=\"s1\"> Lewis’s show and his </span>latest project is how definitive it is of his multifaceted musicality. His ability to pull from a multitude of influences — whether <span class=\"s1\">it be </span>disco, East Coast hip-hop, R&amp;B or indie — and still maintain the cool and calm composure <span class=\"s1\">which </span>characterizes his niche in electronic music is fascinating.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Ending with “Warm,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> a slow-burning tune he impressively sang himself, and an encore comprised of both an unreleased track <span class=\"s1\">and </span>“Yours,<span class=\"s1\">”</span> Lewis truly encapsulated the crowd in the sort of sentiments that define the end of a night out <span class=\"s1\">—</span> bittersweet and empty, <span class=\"s1\">but </span>also a longing for <span class=\"s1\">the peak’s sweet return</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Lewis has proven <span class=\"s1\">his ability to master a</span> myriad of sounds<span class=\"s1\">,</span> and if Wednesday night was any indicator of how effective his forthcoming album will be in telling the narrative he <span class=\"s1\">intends</span>, I<span class=\"s1\"> a</span>m positive he <span class=\"s1\">will be successful</span>.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84563\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84563\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/sg-lewis-makes-his-return-to-sb-with-an-arsenal-of-new-sounds/","id":6627,"author":{"id":685,"name":"Austin Fauni"},"related":[6626,6625,6624],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/685"}},"__N_SSG":true}
