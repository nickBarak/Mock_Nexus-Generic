Two hours earlier, the boozed burrito-buyer had nearly eaten shit right in front of the officers, not a block from Freebirds.</p>\n<p>At that time, the inebriated man was all alone. He told the officers it was his 21st birthday, which his ID confirmed, and they allowed him to call for a sober escort. When Jesus, his friend and savior, arrived minutes later, the deputies told him to take his legally drunk friend straight home.</p>\n<p>When the officers later spotted the blacked-out birthday boy outside Freebirds, he was even more intoxicated. The officers asked why he wasn’t at home, and he told them that he was still trying to find his way.</p>\n<p>His birthday nearly two hours past, the deputies felt no remorse in leading the 21-year-old to a bed… at the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Where’s Amy?</b></p>\n<p>Sat., Feb. 27, 1:50 a.m. — Deputies working the late shift were called to the 6600 block of Trigo Road on reports that someone was disturbing the peace.</p>\n<p>When the officers arrived, they spotted a young man pounding on the door of the apartment screaming to see “Amy Kim.” So fervent was the man in his quest to find Amy that he was, remarkably, foaming from the mouth.</p>\n<p>Even after the officers contacted the 20-year-old, he refused to stop screaming. In an attempt to diffuse the situation, one of the deputies knocked on the door and asked the residents if they knew where Amy was. The slightly frightened tenants informed the deputy they had never heard of Amy Kim before.</p>\n<p>However, this new piece of information did not persuade the ranting drunk, who accused the apartment dwellers of hiding his precious Amy.</p>\n<p>Seeing no way to convince him otherwise, the deputies did what they do best: arrested him. They later transferred the dry-mouthed drunk to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-03-03/police-blotter-51/","id":3828,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3827,3826,3825],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. -- A manly expletive (\"Fuck!\") drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Dishonorably Drunk</b></p>\n<p>Sun., Feb. 21, 12:42 a.m. — A manly expletive (“Fuck!”) drifting through the air on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road caught the attention of patrolling officers.</p>\n<p>Looking around for the source, the deputies spotted a well-built young man staggering down the street, all alone. The officers approached the blatantly drunk man, who was later revealed to be a Marine, to check on his welfare.</p>\n<p>After getting his name, the officers asked how much the 18-year old had had to drink. The muscular war machine informed the officers he had drank an impressive three drinks. Then when asked what he would do in an emergency, the trained military man said he would call his mom.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the intoxicated soldier believed he was in San Bernardino, on his way to Camp Pendleton in San Diego County.</p>\n<p>The officers were forced to inform him, however, that he would instead be heading to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>The Boozer and the Bush</b></p>\n<p>Fri., Feb. 19, 10:42 p.m. — Deputies on patrol on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive were put to work when they witnessed a large bush get the better of a passing reveler.</p>\n<p>A clearly intoxicated female was walking westbound down DP when she veered off the sidewalk and into a shrub, which engulfed her inebriated body. After disappearing into its thick foliage, the bush lover was spotted crawling on her hands and knees out of the hedge and back onto the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Back on her feet, the twiggy gal then walked between two parked cars and squatted down. When the deputies arrived some moments later, they caught the young lady with her pants down… literally.</p>\n<p>Averting their eyes, the deputies waited for the 19-year-old woman to do up her pants and then sat her down on the curb to question her. When asked her address, she told the officers she lived at “6622 Abrego.” Seconds later, she told them “6255 Picasso.” Needless to say, neither was correct.</p>\n<p>The lost drunk was given solace, however, when the officers arrested her: She didn’t need to worry about finding a place to sleep. The officers transferred her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20329\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20329\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-24/police-blotter-50/","id":3831,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3830,3829,3828],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., Feb. 12, 10:18 p.m. -- Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Pasado Road were alerted to trouble when someone yelled \"Man down!\" from their front door.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Sleepy in Chicago</b><br>\n<i>Fri., Feb. 12, 10:18 p.m.</i> — Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Pasado Road were alerted to trouble when someone yelled “Man down!” from their front door.</p>\n<p>The deputies walked over and found a young man, his clothes soiled with dirt and God knows what else, completely passed out in the gravel beside the driveway of the house.</p>\n<p>After unsuccessfully attempting to wake the defeated drunkard, the officers called in the medical response team on fears of alcohol poisoning.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old man, who woke as the paramedics arrived, was not happy and repeatedly shouted “fuck” and asked why it was necessary for them to assist him.</p>\n<p>After getting the OK from the paramedics, the officers arrested the inebriated, insolent man for public intoxication. He was put in a patrol car, at which time he told the deputies that he commutes from Chicago to Santa Barbara City College every day to attend school.</p>\n<p>Thinking to themselves that SBCC isn’t even worth the commute from I.V., the officers kept driving towards the Santa Barbara County Jail, where they housed the likely corrupt young man, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>From Russia, With Love</b><br>\n<i>Fri., Feb. 12, 11:18 p.m.</i> — The Isla Vista Foot Patrol was called to action when officers spotted a young man carrying a bottle of vodka down Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>The officers approached the young man, who was an extra shade of pale, and grabbed him by the arm. When asked his age, the inebriated man told them he was 21. The deputies wanted to see his ID, however, and, releasing his arm, told him to get it.</p>\n<p>His arm now free, the pasty man made a break for it and started sprinting down the street. His escape was short lived, however, and he was quickly tackled.

Seeing this, the officers perked up, happy to enforce their zero tolerance policy, and made their way toward the suave partier.</p>\n<p>Noticing his tail, the Keystone King tucked in behind some cars and ditched his kingly can, but it was too late. The deputies caught up and asked the inebriated man why he was drinking in the street. The Goleta resident, a classy man by nature, took the high road and told them, “I know, I’m drunk in public.”</p>\n<p>Despite the confession, the officers continued to prod and asked the self-described drunk if he knew where he was. Confidently, he answered, “Del Trigo.”</p>\n<p>Convinced he was, in fact, drunk in public, the deputies sat the man on the curb and slapped on handcuffs. With this, the intoxicated man became aggravated and asked his arresting officers, “Why you messing with me? Look at all these people doing cocaine, and shit like that.”</p>\n<p>A quick glance into the street revealed no cocaine, however, and deputies calmly explained why they were “messing” with him. The deputies later transported the man to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>It’s Good, but Not That Good…</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 29, 3:47 p.m. — Domino’s new and improved pizza brought one drunken man to his knees… and into the hands of the law.</p>\n<p>Resisting the allure of fluffy, distinctly cardboard-free crust and bubbling, now-made-from-real-milk cheese, the deputies were walking past the I.V. pizzeria when they spotted the grown man blocking the entrance.</p>\n<p>The 44-year-old — a local resident — was kneeling just in front of the door with a nearly empty 24-ounce bottle of malt liquor sitting beside him. The clearly inebriated man had a wad of crumpled dollar bills in one hand and was yelling at the patrons gathered around him. While his words were unintelligible, one could only guess he was shouting about the greatness that is the new Domino’s pizza.</p>\n<p>As the deputies approached, they watched as the “pizza man” lost his balance and face-planted into the cement. He righted himself, only to fall face-first again. This was repeated several times until the officers arrived and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending discovery of the telephone.</p>\n<p><b>Neighborly Love</b></p>\n<p>Friday, Jan. 30, 2:31 a.m. — Deputies working the late shift were called to 6500 block of Seville on reports of a fight.</p>\n<p>Some time earlier, two men had been sitting in their apartment when they heard a knock on their door. They opened it to find their neighbor, heavily intoxicated and royally pissed about something.</p>\n<p>The 21-year-old was too drunk to use words however, and instead just punched his neighbor in the face. The motion proved too violent, however, as the inebriated man lost his balance and fell backward down the stairs.</p>\n<p>When the officers arrived, they found the pugnacious partier standing in the courtyard, bleeding from the cheek. The deputies attempted to talk with him, but all he would say was something about his neighbors “disrespecting” him.</p>\n<p>Unable to get any more out of him, the deputies arrested him and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20139\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20139\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-02-03/police-blotter-48/","id":3829,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3828,3827,3826],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Pantsless Partier Fri, Jan. 22, 11:24 p.m. — A man staggering down the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive caught the attention of patrolling officers.

The deputies asked the 19-year-old if he had any identification with him and he told them, in thick, slurred speech, that it was in his pocket.</p>\n<p>The intoxicated reveler then reached into his pocket and, in so doing, pulled his pants down to his knees. Embarrassed, the pantsless partier tried to re-cover himself but was simply too drunk to do so. Luckily, the I.V. Foot Patrol are trained for all manner of situation, and one of the deputies was able to assist in pulling the exposed man’s trousers back up.</p>\n<p>With one disaster averted, the deputies moved on and asked the beltless boozer if he knew what street he was on. He replied he was on “Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>While no doubt a reasonable drunken answer, the deputies formed the opinion that the wasted walker was just too drunk and arrested him for public intoxication. He was later transferred to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>An I.V. Wizz</b></p>\n<p>Sun, Jan. 24, 12:47 p.m. — Deputies on a uniformed patrol watched as an inebriated reveler veered off the sidewalk, stumbled over some landscaping and face planted into a hedge of bushes.</p>\n<p>The officers, standing near the intersection of Camino Pescadero and Sabado Tarde, made their way towards the not-so-sure-footed drinker as he worked his way out of the bush. Getting to his feet, the 20-year-old made a step back towards the sidewalk, caught his foot on an innocent shrub, and went toppling back towards the ground.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived, helped the defeated drunk to his feet, and asked his name. He responded by muttering something undistinguishable. Not terribly surprised by the answer, the officers shrugged it off and asked him where he lived. While not quite a real street, his reply “Sabo Ardo” was at least close.</p>\n<p>It was at this point that the deputies picked up on the rancid smell of urine wafting through the air, and a quick glance at the reveler’s crotch confirmed he was the source. The urine stains were not confined to his jeans, however. Dark spots on his jacket sleeves suggested he had also managed to piss on his arms.</p>\n<p>Taking extra care not to get too much urine on their hands, the officers slapped cuffs on the pee-stained partier and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-20068\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-20068\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-27/police-blotter-47/","id":3827,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3826,3825,3824],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sat Jan. 16, 1:12 a.m. - A parked car with its door opened wide caught the attention of officers driving westbound on Pasado Road.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Mind the Door</b></p>\n<p>Sat Jan. 16, 1:12 a.m. – A parked car with its door opened wide caught the attention of officers driving westbound on Pasado Road.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the car – a four-door Chevy truck – and shined their flashlights into the back seat. There, lying face down, was a victim of overconsumption, dreaming drunken dreams.</p>\n<p>His head half hanging out the opened door, the 19-year-old man was a sight to behold. Chunks of vomit clung to his face, covered his hands, stained his T-shirt and saturated the car seat. A few select chunks had made their way out of the car and were pooled in the gutter.</p>\n<p>The officers shook the sleeping beauty awake, taking extra care not to get vomit on their hands, and collected the out-of-towner’s information. Hoping not to have to arrest him, the deputies asked if the defeated reveler had any friends who could assist him.</p>\n<p>The puking prince told them José would come to his rescue and he pulled out his phone to dial him. However, after shouting his name several times, the officers asked to see the phone and discovered the soiled young man had never dialed the number.</p>\n<p>With no José, the deputies had no recourse but to arrest the young man.

A simple tap on the window didn’t wake the slumbering out-of-towners, however, nor did aggressive banging.</p>\n<p>The IVFP doesn’t employ quitters, though, and after nearly two minutes of trying, the deputies were able to wake the sloppy sleepers. What was awaiting them inside the car, however, no one can be trained for.</p>\n<p>First was the smell, horrid and acidic. Next the visual, two young bodies covered entirely in their own puke. Vomit was in their hair, on their clothing, covering their seats and pooled on the floor.</p>\n<p>Two grown adults could live with such an experience – at least their parents wouldn’t have to know.

Taken aback, the driver stepped on the gas and then abruptly hit the brakes in the hopes of shaking the crazed reveler, but succeeded only in shifting his body onto the hood.</p>\n<p>Reacting to this boorish move by the driver, the inebriated cowboy stood up on the hood, shouted “What the fuck?!” and slammed his heel through the front windshield, shattering it instantly.</p>\n<p>The deputies arrived some minutes later, and, thanks to their superb training, were able to track down the suspect without difficulty. It was made easier, however, by the fact that their man had managed to fall asleep while standing.</p>\n<p>The officers woke the 20-year-old Menlo Park resident and put him in handcuffs. Having been read his Miranda rights, the vandal turned to the officer and said, “I would like to know what I’m being charged with.” The deputy explained that kicking through a windshield is in fact a crime, to which the suspect replied, “I just want to know what I’m being charged with.”</p>\n<p>Despite several explanations, the inebriated man was unable to comprehend why he was arrested.

She told the deputies she wouldn’t leave without her cell phone battery, but after a moving good cop/bad cop routine, the officers were able to convince her otherwise.</p>\n<p>Love is a difficult beast to break, however. An hour and a half later, the deputies received another call saying that the girl had returned, this time with even more alcohol on her breath. The deputies arrived and escorted her out of the apartment and down the stairs.</p>\n<p>At first refusing to answer any questions, the UCSB student quickly changed tactics and demanded that the officers take her to jail. To prove she was serious, she then ordered them to do so.</p>\n<p>Happy to oblige, the deputies took her to the I.V. substation, where she insisted they give her a breathalyzer test. The deputy instructed her that was not necessary, but she continued to demand one.</p>\n<p>The issue was put to rest, however, when the officers transferred her to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19961\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19961\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-01-13/police-blotter-45/","id":3906,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3905,3904,3903],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"That’s a Bush, Not a Bed Sat., Nov. 14, 12:03 a.m. — A heavily intoxicated man seated on the curb attracted the attention of several passing revelers and, subsequently, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol....","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><strong>That’s a Bush,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Not a Bed</strong></p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 14, 12:03 a.m. — A heavily intoxicated man seated on the curb attracted the attention of several passing revelers and, subsequently, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>Seated near the intersection of Pasado Road and Camino Corto, the 18-year-old had seemingly reached, and then surpassed, his limit.

Sitting there with his head hanging low, the UCSB student had the whole spectrum of bodily fluids staining his body, including a mucus-covered face, vomit-stained shirt and urine-soaked jeans.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until the deputies began dragging the man to a patrol car that they got anything out of him: projectile vomit.</p>\n<p>After soiling the back seat of the patrol car, the man was booked into the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Say My Name</strong></p>\n<p>Sat., Nov. 21, 10:49 p.m. — An act of drunken vandalism proved disastrous for one Isla Vista resident.</p>\n<p>Deputies patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive were approached by a distraught female complaining that an inebriated passerby had snapped the antenna off her car. What’s more, she told the officers her friends had kept the vandal in place through the cunning use of distraction.</p>\n<p>The deputies approached the 18-year-old man and could immediately tell he was exceptionally drunk. They asked the man his name, to which he replied, “What’s my name.” When asked his age, he replied “What’s my age.”</p>\n<p>No matter the question, the inebriated local would answer by simply repeating the question. Frustrated, the officers arrested the man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly: To Be Expected</strong></p>\n<p>Sun., Nov. 22, 12:22 a.m. — Deputies on patrol couldn’t help but notice an especially raucous partier stumbling down Del Playa Drive early Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>With a plastic beer helmet snuggly in place atop his head, the 18-year-old struggled to navigate the bustle surrounding him. After nearly falling on own his volition, the Cal Poly Mustang then stumbled into a fair-skinned Gaucho, who nearly fell herself.</p>\n<p>After being told off, the drunken man turned and tried out his best pick up line: “Fuck you!” But instead of snatching one of Isla Vista’s famed beauties, he was snatched by I.V.’s other famed demographic, the not-so-beautiful Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>A quick conversation with the foul-mouthed Mustang was all the fodder the officers needed, who promptly arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39281\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39281\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-11-25/police-blotter-70/","id":3905,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3904,3903,3902],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fri., Oct. 16, 11:22 p.m. -- A group of men gathered around an empty lot at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista's finest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>The Puking Princess</b></p>\n<p>Fri., Oct. 16, 11:22 p.m. — A group of men gathered around an empty lot at the corner of Camino Del Sur and Trigo Road caught the attention of Isla Vista’s finest.</p>\n<p>As the deputies made their way toward the crowd, they spotted the group’s focal point: a young lady bent over vomiting in the grass.

But the slug wasn’t ready to be salted just yet, and while the officer was looking down at his notepad, he made his break and started sprinting down the street.</p>\n<p>The deputy made chase, and his attempts to taser the escapee failed. And then his own legs failed him: just paces from catching up, the officer lost his footing and ate shit in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>Officers don’t work alone, though, and a fellow member of the Foot Patrol was able to tackle the fleeing northerner. The damage, however, had already been done.</p>\n<p>If Only It Was Twist-Off</p>\n<p>Fri., Sept. 15, 11:28 p.m. — Deputies on patrol near the intersection of Camino Del Sur and Pasado Road stopped an inebriated man after he stumbled into several parked cars.</p>\n<p>The officers asked the unsteady stroller where he lived, and he was quick to tell them that he lived at “243 Sabado.” But before the deputies could tell him such an address doesn’t exist, he pointed to a house at the corner of the intersection and told them he lived there.</p>\n<p>Feeling pretty certain that the 20-year-old was making things up, the deputies asked the lost boy if he could call a friend to walk him home. The drunken UCSB student said he could and proceeded to pull out his keys from his front pocket.</p>\n<p>Unsure of his intentions, the officers asked him a second time if he would call a friend. This time, the man pointed to a bottle opener attached to his keys and said, “O.K., it’s right here.”</p>\n<p>Whether he thought the bottle opener was a phone, or perhaps a friendly escort, the officers couldn’t tell, but such clarification was not needed to arrest him for public intoxication.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-19349\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-19349\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2009-10-01/police-blotter-41/","id":3903,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3902,3901,3900],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Friday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. - A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b>Watch Your Step</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:14 p.m. – A man walking by a house at the corner of El Embarcadero and Del Playa Drive suddenly lost his balance and face-planted on the sidewalk, catching the eye of a patrolling officer.</p>\n<p>The deputy went to check on the well-being of the 19-year-old and immediately noticed the strong odor of alcohol emanating from his person. The not-so-sure-footed partier had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, and his clothes were soiled in what appeared to be his own bodily fluids.</p>\n<p>As the deputy spoke with the now-seated man, he began to vomit vigorously. After he was done regurgitating his dinner, he slumped over to the side, almost landed in his own pile of vomit, and fell fast asleep.</p>\n<p>The officer awoke the sickly man and continued questioning him, making sure not to step in the puddle of sick.</p>\n<p>The deputy asked the man what he had been drinking, and not surprisingly, the young man stated, “Tequila.”</p>\n<p>Having heard all he needed to hear, the officer arrested the young man and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Marking Your Territory</b><br>\nFriday, Sept. 19, 11:20 p.m. – Officers poking around a Del Playa parking lot came across a young man defacing a stranger’s vehicle.</p>\n<p>The deputies watched as the 19-year-old UCSB student pulled down his zipper, whipped it out and began urinating on the side of a minivan. He was, however, too drunk to keep his balance and had to use the minivan for support as he relieved himself.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even with the van’s steady support, standing tall was just too difficult and the perp stumbled to the side and started peeing on his own leg.</p>\n<p>An officer walked up behind the man and told him to “zip it up.” Caught red-handed, the young man turned around and still tried to play it cool, telling the officer he hadn’t been urinating.</p>\n<p>His zipper was still down, however, and the officer told him once more to zip it up, which he eventually did. The deputy then began to question the young man, but he proved to be uncooperative.</p>\n<p>Judging that the man was unable to care for himself, the officer arrested the young pisser and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p><b>Deaf, Dumb and Blind</b><br>\nSat. Sept. 20, 12:14 a.m. – An SBCC student walking west down Del Playa Drive caught the attention of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol.</p>\n<p>Acting as if he were a human pinball and Del Playa was his alcohol-themed pinball machine, the 20-year-old man was bumping into people left and right as he attempted to navigate the busy street. He had with him a female escort, but not even a pinball wizard could have controlled his reckless walking.</p>\n<p>Then the unsteady stroller bumped into the wrong man, who got up in his face and started shouting. The deputies hastened towards the intoxicated man, hoping to get to him before he got himself into real trouble.</p>\n<p>The officers reached the young man and told him to sit down on the curb, which he did, and started asking him for his information. Due to his level of intoxication, however, he proved difficult to talk to. His speech was so slurred the deputy had to ask him to repeat answers several times before he could comprehend what he was trying to saying.</p>\n<p>He told the officers he had been drinking at a friend’s house and was heading to another friend’s house. Isla Vista’s Finest were forced to disagree, however, and arrested the man right there. He was later transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17188\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17188\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-09-26/police-blotter-29/","id":3887,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3886,3885,3884],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Busted","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2008-08-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"\"There are so many drunk people here, I don't know why you chose us.\"","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>“There are so many drunk people here, I don’t know why you chose us.”</p>\n<p>Despite the truth underlining this drunken reasoning – there are armies of drunken partiers marching down the street just a few feet away – this intoxicated 19-year-old Santa Barbara City College student isn’t talking his way out of the alcohol citation coming his way.</p>\n<p>With a zero-tolerance policy backing his actions, Sgt.

All around, 18 to 22-year-olds are making their way towards the ocean – specifically, toward Isla Vista’s notorious Del Playa Drive. Even a few blocks away from I.V.’s main drag, the faint buzz of speakers can be heard.</p>\n<p>But first, a cup of coffee. It’s the last Friday of summer for anyone attending Santa Barbara City College, and the sergeant and his accompanying officer know that tonight is going to be a long one.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista, UCSB’s crowded, pint-sized college town is often – and falsely – called the most densely populated neighborhood on the West Coast. Its reputation for debauchery, however, is much more quantifiable: With only approximately 10 percent of the county’s total population, I.V. accounts for roughly 20 percent of serious crimes committed – the vast majority of which are linked to alcohol use.</p>\n<p>According to Sgt. Raney, curbing the use of alcohol is at the heart of what the IVFP does.</p>\n<p>“If we can control the alcohol, we can help mitigate the serious crimes and accidents [so prominent in I.V.],” Raney says.</p>\n<p><b>Not-so-medical Marijuana</b></p>\n<p>The quick jerk of the man’s hand toward his back pocket immediately catches the attention of the patrolling officers. He might as well have just walked up and told the cops he was doing something illegal.</p>\n<p>It’s 10:55 p.m. and Sgt. Raney asks the man what he just put in his back pocket. Unfortunately for this second year SBCC student, playing dumb is not going to work. Sgt. Raney suspects it may be a bag of cocaine he stuffed into his pocket (an automatic arrest), so he places the man in handcuffs and asks him again, “What’s in your pocket?”</p>\n<p>Seeing that there is no way out, the man confesses, “A gram of marijuana.”</p>\n<p>The handcuffs are removed and he is told to sit on the curb. Sgt. Raney writes out the citation for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, a misdemeanor offense that’s going to cost the toker a little more than $100.</p>\n<p>Trying to make light of the situation, the young man tells the officers he doesn’t even have a pipe to smoke his recently purchased weed.</p>\n<p>“I just figured I’d pick that up later,” he says.</p>\n<p><b>A Captain’s Tale</b></p>\n<p>“I don’t think that’s legal,” yells a reveler socializing in front of a party on oceanside Del Playa Drive. “That’s private property!”</p>\n<p>The sheriff pays him no mind and continues down the side alley, making his way toward the balcony jutting precariously out over the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>“Even if it is private property, if it’s an open party or can be viewed from the street, we have the right to enter,” Sgt. Raney says as he passes onto the property.</p>\n<p>There, unaware of his imminent arrival, are five underage drinkers enjoying the sound of the waves and the comforting warmth of Captain Morgan’s Spiced Rum. There are not many places where college students have it so good, but with the pros come the cons.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t take the officers long to determine that none of the revelers are of age. However, some insist on trying to talk their way out of it, swearing that the half-drunk beers that sit directly between their feet are not theirs.</p>\n<p>Caught red-handed, however, nobody is getting out of it. All five watch as their Minor in Possessions – the most common of citations according to Sgt. Raney – are written out and their booze is poured onto the ground.</p>\n<p>One, however, is adamant about talking his way out trouble, insisting he is a good guy and that he isn’t drunk at all. Sgt. Raney agrees he is no doubt a good guy, but keeps filling out the paperwork.</p>\n<p>With the yellow citation in hand – an approximate $150 ticket plus the cost of the drug awareness classes most opt for – the young man changes gears and tries to salvage what is left of the night.</p>\n<p>“If you were honestly cool cops, you’d let me drink that beer right now,” the 19-year-old says, referring to the nearly full forty of Miller Genuine Draft sitting at his feet. Without uttering a word, the accompanying officer picks up the beer and pours it out onto the cement.</p>\n<p><b>May I Recommend a Bush?</b></p>\n<p>There are a definite drawbacks to heavy drinking (a killer hangover, a bad decision or two, not remembering if you made a bad decision or two) but few are more prevalent – or urgent – than the need to urinate.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, you just can’t find that necessary toilet.</p>\n<p>If this is the case, a trip into one of Isla Vista’s many parks could be an (illegal) necessity, but pissing on the side of building in view of the street is never a good idea.</p>\n<p>It’s 12:50 a.m. and Sgt. Raney catches a glimpse of a man making just that mistake.</p>\n<p>Upon noticing the sheriff, he instinctively grabs his phone and makes like he was busy texting, only his phone is locked and the screen remains blank.</p>\n<p>The man is asked to sit on the curb, and while the officer is filling out the citation, a resident of the apartment comes out to vouch for the man.</p>\n<p>“He’s one of my very good friends,” she tells Sgt. Raney.</p>\n<p>“Did he have permission to pee on the side of your apartment?” Raney asks with a slight smile, but receives no answer.</p>\n<p>The man is cited for breaking a county ordinance, the lesser of two possible citations. Had he been especially rude, Raney says, he could have received the more severe penalty, which carries with it a fine of over $700.</p>\n<p><b>867-5309</b></p>\n<p>It’s 1:05 a.m. and the streets of Isla Vista are still crowded, albeit more intoxicated than a few hours earlier. Sgt. Raney and his fellow officer are standing in the shadows along Del Playa Drive, waiting for something to catch their attention.</p>\n<p>A young female, clearly intoxicated, stumbles by, holding on to a young man who doesn’t appear to be a good friend. Sgt. Raney stops the pair and asks to talk with the young lady.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney asks if she knows her male counterpart, and she tells him that they met tonight. Her accent tells him that she is not a native to Isla Vista, and he asks her where she is staying. The young Swedish woman points back and says, “the house with the dolphins on it.”</p>\n<p>Sgt. Raney believes she is too drunk to take care of herself and, for her own safety, does not want to leave her with her newly acquired friend. He asks her if she has any other friends with her and she shakes her head, but offers to call them.</p>\n<p>The sheriff agrees, and she tries a few numbers without success, until finally reaching a friend. Sgt. Raney takes the phone from her, introduces himself and tells the young woman’s friend, “Come and get your friend, so she doesn’t go to jail.”</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, a gaggle of girls shows up and leads the young Swede away.</p>\n<p>“I was trying to protect an intoxicated woman strolling down the street with a random guy,” Raney says later. Had her friends not shown up, he says, he would have had to arrest her for public intoxication, which can have potentially serious ramifications and almost always includes a night in jail.</p>\n<p><b>Pending Sobriety</b></p>\n<p>The moon is sinking beneath the western horizon and the streets are starting to finally clear out. It’s nearly two in the morning and the fervor from hours past is starting to wane.</p>\n<p>Standing at the corner of DP and El Embarcadero, a number of the deputies congregate to discuss the night’s events, but none can help but notice when a highly intoxicated female stumbles out into the middle of street carrying her shoes in one hand and dropping her phone with the other.</p>\n<p>Two officers immediately make their way toward her, and watch as she attempts to pick up her phone, only to drop one of her shoes. The officers walk up to her and tell her to stop, but she brushes them off and continues walking, saying, “I’m not drinking.”</p>\n<p>One of the officers grabs her arm, and directs her to the curb. They ask her for her age and she tells them she’s 21. Her demeanor is combative, and she attempts to stand up, but is quickly reprimanded. She is asked her age again.</p>\n<p>“Twenty-four,” is her new answer. The deputy tells her she just gave two separate answers and she says, “I’m 23.”</p>\n<p>The officers stand her up and slap handcuffs on her. She continues to tell them that she’s not drunk, but her appeals fall on deaf ears. The deputies arrest her for being drunk in public.</p>\n<p>(An easy way to avoid this fate is to always walk with someone and never give the police a reason to stop you. Stumbling down the street and repeatedly dropping your belongings are dead giveaways.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the young lady acted unwisely and has to pay the consequences. After a few moments, a patrol car picks her up and transports her to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she is housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-17120\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-17120\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2008-08-30/busted-2/","id":3571,"author":{"id":265,"name":"Travis Miller"},"related":[3570,3569,3568],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/265"}},"__N_SSG":true}
