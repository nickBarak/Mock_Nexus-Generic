The Gauchos opened the fifth set by taking a 6-3 lead but, after a timeout, Fullerton went on a 4-0 run to jump ahead. A few points later the Gauchos tied the set at nine apiece, but a hitting error from senior right side Stacey Schmidt gave Fullerton the lead. The Titans commanded the rest of the match, going on to win the set 15-10 and hand the Gauchos the loss.</p>\n<p>“It didn’t feel like we played badly, they just played better,” Lowe said. “It felt like we couldn’t get going. They had a really good home crowd and that got to us. It’s hard to play away.”</p>\n<p>The stat sheet of the match tells a different story than the final result. UCSB recorded a season-high 94 digs and Lowe and sophomore Leah Sully each put up career highs in that category, with 33 and 23 respectively. Lowe now has 1030 career digs. The defense also held Fullerton to just a .139 hitting percentage, but UCSB hit only .070 and committed 30 hitting errors.</p>\n<p>“The night before we had one of our best passing games,” Gregory said. “In this game our passing went down. We just continually went outside too much.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s match was not any easier, though the result for the Gauchos was more favorable. Long Beach took the first set 25-19 on a hitting error by UCSB, but Santa Barbara came right back in the second set, never trailing on their way to a 25-18 win. Sully led the squad in that set, collecting four kills, including three in a row, to give the Gauchos a 12-6 lead.</p>\n<p>The third set was fought down to the final point. After battling back to get within one point at 24-23, the Gauchos lost the set 25-23 on a Long Beach kill. The fourth set saw UCSB trail until a hitting error gave the Gauchos a 21-20 lead. The team then went on to win the set 25-23 and force a fifth set after taking three of the final four points on kills from Schmidt, senior Kara Sherrard and sophomore Katey Thompson, who had a career-high 13 kills on the day, to go along with a career-high 17 digs.</p>\n<p>“We were very fortunate [to win that fourth game],” Gregory said. “Once you get down two games to one, you’re just thinking about surviving.”</p>\n<p>Early in the fifth set the Gauchos trailed 5-2 but after Gregory called a timeout, UCSB went on a 7-2 run during which five Gauchos recorded kills. After battling to get ahead 13-11 in their favor, the Gauchos finished the set — and match — 15-11 behind consecutive kills from Thompson and Sherrard.</p>\n<p>“We adjusted our passing rotation,” Gregory said. “The outside hitters turned it on and we defended a little bit better. In a game like that you have to find a way to win, and we did.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will next take the court to face Pacific at home on Friday, Sept. 30 at 7:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41256\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41256\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-09-26/gauchos-split-pair-big-west-road-openers/","id":5464,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5463,5462,5461],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Split Pair of Big West Openers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2011-09-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s volleyball team split its opening games of conference play on the road last weekend, beating No. 21 Long Beach State on Friday before falling to Cal State Fullerton on Saturday.

Josh Johnson, Jon Lester and Roy Halladay have been knocking down fools like bowling pins all season. And since my hitters can’t find their swings, they are the reason my fantasy team is still doing well.</p>\n<p>I was right about a few lesser-known players. Kyle McClellan, though he has started to come back down to earth, is still 5-1 with a 3.62 ERA, making him a great option. Josh Tomlin is also 5-1. He won’t strike out many, but he has yet to let off more than three runs in a start and has given up that many in just two of his eight starts so far.</p>\n<p>I was right about the Red Sox being able to recover from their awful start. Jon Lester and Josh Beckett held that team together through the force of their combined will until the hitting came around. Now that it has, I can confidently return to my Red Sox division title prediction.</p>\n<p>I was right about the San Francisco Giants. To my friends who are Giants fans: try not to get mad, but the Giants suck. Last season’s World Series win was a fluke. True, the Giants are in first place, but seriously, the NL West is a joke.</p>\n<p>I was wrong that drafting fast was the best strategy in fantasy drafts. Yes, it cuts down on draft time and therefore increases the chance that you’ll leave with your sanity intact, but it also increases the chances that you’ll miss out on that one player that could catapult you to the top of your league. If you’re going to take the time to sit through a draft, you might as well do a thorough job of drafting.</p>\n<p>I was wrong about Justin Bieber. I used to think that he was the worst thing to happen to music, but Rebecca Black has proved me wrong. She has convinced me that music is officially dead, and every time I hear her song, which I refuse to mention by name, I die a little bit on the inside.</p>\n<p>I was, unfortunately, right about the NFL labor situation. The lockout is still in effect and there are no signs that it is going to lift anytime soon. I would not be at all surprised if there was no football next season and honestly, that might be good for the NFL. Those rich bastards will learn that their fans aren’t so loyal that they will put up with this nonsense and maybe, just maybe, football will once again become about the fans instead of the money. But probably not.</p>\n<p>Finally, I was wrong that I wouldn’t resort to shameless self-promotion. If you check out my twitter (@jgreenbergnexus) you’ll get a preview of what I’m going to talk about in my column each week, as well as a number of other things you definitely need to know.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We still aren’t convinced Daily Nexus columnist Joshua Greenberg thinks about anything other than fantasy baseball.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-39204\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-39204\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-19/green-advice-wrong/","id":2130,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2129,2128,2127],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Trust Issues","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There are a lot of things that go into successfully managing a fantasy baseball team.

The last time he pitched a full season was back in 2005, when he posted a 1.16 WHIP and a 3.48 ERA. Since then, he has not been able to log more than 99.1 innings in a season and has managed an ERA under four just once, when he pitched seven games for Boston in 2008. Maybe this is the second coming of Bartolo, but I think he is going to start to regress, and soon.</p>\n<p>Bud Norris, SP, Houston Astros: 2 wins, 3.16 ERA, 52 strikeouts</p>\n<p>This is only Norris’ third season in the majors, so he may be reaching his potential, but it just seems too drastically different from his previous two seasons, in which he posted very similar stats. His ERA is almost two runs lower than it was last season, and his 52 strikeouts put him on pace to far exceed the 158 he posted in 27 starts a year ago. Add that to a lower walk rate, and you get a player who seems to have reinvented himself in the course of one offseason. Like I said, he may have simply found his stride, but I would be very surprised if he didn’t end the season with an ERA a lot closer to four.</p>\n<p>Matt Joyce, OF, Tampa Bay Rays: .356 AVG, 3 HR, 14 RBI</p>\n<p>Joyce’s current stats are so out of line with what he posted in his previous three seasons that the only possible conclusion is that he is riding a very long hot streak. Joyce is a career .262 hitter and has never hit for an average higher than .252 before this season. Similarly, his current OPS (.956), slugging percentage (.554) and on-base percentage (.356) are much higher than anything he’s posted before. He’s due to come back down to earth soon, and the fall could hit owners who trusted him very hard indeed.</p>\n<p>Russell Martin, C, New York Yankees: .255 AVG, 6 HR, 20 RBI</p>\n<p>For those of you who picked Martin up when he was hitting over .300 and are holding on to him in case he brings his average back up, forget it. Martin has not hit over .250 since 2008. His on-base percentage (.358) is also settling into the area that it has been in for the last three seasons. The only thing that’s keeping him a viable option is his .500 slugging percentage, but that’s due to come down as well, as the last time he even slugged better than .400 was 2007.</p>\n<p>Daisuke Matsuzaka, SP, Boston Red Sox: 3 wins, 24 strikeouts, 4.64 ERA</p>\n<p>Daisuke has allowed two or fewer runs in four of his last five starts (though one of those was only one inning) and has started to walk fewer batters. However, he let up four runs in six innings in his last start and two runs in a one inning appearance against the Angels four days earlier. He has posted an ERA under 4.40 once in his career with the Red Sox, and I believe that his ERA will settle about where it is for the rest of the season. If you picked him up thinking that he was going to keep throwing gems like the one he threw against the Angels on April 23 or against the Blue Jays on April 18, you are out of luck.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus fantasy sports columnist Josh Greenberg likes lists.

What they did get was Newton, an egomaniac who will need at least two seasons to prepare before he’s ready to compete at the NFL level. Even then, he’s not guaranteed to fit into an NFL system. For a team that gave up the second-most rushing touchdowns and was last in almost every passing category, drafting a developmental quarterback and no significant defensive help will certainly come back to haunt them in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>New England Patriots:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: OT Nate Solder</strong></p>\n<p>The NFL community seems to believe that Bill Belichick is a crafty genius when it comes to the draft. As an ardent Patriots fan I’d like to believe it, yet it is hard for me to see the reason in not drafting a pass-rusher before the sixth round. Sure, Solder might be the heir apparent to the aging Matt Light and QB Ryan Mallett is almost certainly that for Tom Brady — but why draft another corner when they’ve already spent high picks in previous years on Darius Butler and Devin McCourty, and have capable veteran Leigh Bodden to back them up? The most confusing selection of all might be that of tight end Lee Smith in the fifth round after drafting two highly skilled tight ends last year. Maybe Belichick knows something the rest of us don’t. Still, leaving your greatest need unaddressed is never a good idea.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Best</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Buffalo Bills:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: DT Marcel Dareus</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Bills had a lot of problems last season but their main one was defense — particularly their rushing defense. They gave up a total of 335 first downs last season (fifth most in the league) and 138 of those were rushing first downs — more than any other team gave up. Because of this, they used their first four picks to revamp their defense at every level with Dareus, CB Aaron Williams, LB Kelvin Sheppard and Da’Norris Searcy. They might have considered spending a pick on a QB, but Ryan Fitzpatrick showed promise last season and they must have faith in him. They addressed their immediate needs and should be a better team when the new season begins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Detroit Lions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First round selection: DT Nick Fairley</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After giving up 1999 yards on the ground last season, 18 rushing touchdowns (fifth most in the league) and an average of 4.5 yards per carry, the Lions desperately needed a big body up front to stop the run. They got that in Fairley, who will certainly start next season. Their second pick, WR Titus Young provides them with a speed option for when QB Matthew Stafford has to get rid of the ball quickly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-05-04/green-advice-green-people-nfl-draft/","id":2124,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2123,2122,2121],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Third-Seeded Gauchos Upset in First Match of Big West Tourney","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s water polo team lost any hope of gaining an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament with a loss in their first game of the Big West Tournament Friday.

The first time the teams met was back in February in UCSB’s first game of the Triton Invitational in San Diego. It resulted in a 5-2 defeat for the Gauchos, their only loss in the four games they played in the tournament. Their second match came just two weeks ago, when Santa Barbara traveled to Long Beach and handed the 49ers an 8-7 loss.</p>\n<p>“We’ve learned not to overlook them,” senior utility Christie Clark said. “They’re a tough team. We’ve been practicing all week for them and we’re anxious to show them how much we’ve improved.”</p>\n<p>The winner of this year’s tournament will receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Every team in the conference will be battling for that bid, and with the level of talent that the conference features, no team is going to have an easy road.</p>\n<p>“Every team has a chance to win,” Wigo said. “We’re going to be fighting for every win. Everyone has [the automatic bid] in mind.”</p>\n<p>In order to get through the tournament, the Gauchos will need the entire team to play like it was playing in the season’s second half. Prior to March 4, the Gauchos posted a mediocre 10-7 record. But starting with a 14-6 beatdown of St. Francis that day, the Gauchos posted a 10-4 record. Over that period, the Gaucho defense stepped up its play significantly, allowing double-digit goals just twice and holding their opponents to five goals each time.</p>\n<p>“As long as all the girls have their heads in the game and we go for the win in every single one, we have the ability to win them all,” senior utility Kathryn Nelson said.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to a handful of stars to lead the charge. Nelson, who led the team with 37 steals and 11 field blocks this season, is a key figure on defense. Anchoring the goal behind her will be sophomore Ruth Milne, who started all 30 contests this year, led the conference with an average of 12 saves per game and tallied 289 total saves, surpassing her own single-season school record of 275 from last year.</p>\n<p>Nelson, along with senior utility Claire Buchanan, combined for 92 goals to lead the Gauchos’ scoring attack. Buchanan also ended the season on a 10-game goal streak, scoring 21 times. Clark, who finished third in scoring with 29 goals and is currently fourth on UCSB’s all time scoring list with 145, will also be a factor.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we’re playing really well,” Wigo said. “All of our key players have been playing great and we’re playing at home, so we definitely have some things going for us.”</p>\n<p>UC Irvine, the defending conference champions, received the top seed and a first round bye. The winner of Pacific and UC Davis’ match, which begins today at 3:30 p.m., will meet Irvine at the same time on Saturday. The Gauchos will take to the pool to face off with Long Beach at 5:15 p.m., with the winner playing second-seeded CSU Northridge at 5:15 p.m. on Saturday. All matches will be held in Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37403\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37403\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-29/gauchos-host-sixth-seed-long-beach-conference-tournament/","id":5216,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5215,5214,5213],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Good to Be Bad","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If you are in a fantasy baseball league that isn’t rotisserie style, you’re doing it wrong.

In rotisserie play, you gain points based on how well you do in the various scoring categories compared to the rest of the teams in your league. If you do better in a category than your opponents, you gain points. If you do worse, you lose points. How you rank in the individual categories also affects how you obtain points. For instance, if you are ranked No. 1 in a certain category, you won’t gain any points for doing well in that category because you’re already ranked first. You can’t do any better in that category.</p>\n<p>While fair to those with good players and a balanced team, the system can make those owners who rely heavily on either pitching or hitting see red.</p>\n<p>Take my team for example. My pitching is absolutely outstanding. Marlins pitcher Josh Johnson is the Gandalf of the MLB with his absurdly low 0.65 WHIP and the Phillies’ Roy Halladay has humiliated hitters whenever he takes the mound. The rest of my staff — which includes Red Sox ace Jon Lester and Padres’ closer Heath Bell — isn’t too shabby either.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum is my hitting. It’s not that I have bad hitters. My team includes Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre, Arizona shortstop Stephen Drew and third baseman David Freese of the Cardinals. However, the rest of my lineup has begun the season mired in a slump. While I am first or near first in every pitching category, I’m wallowing near the bottom of most hitting categories. Logic would say that my outstanding pitching would at least counter my tear-inducing hitting, but logic would be wrong.</p>\n<p>Because my pitching is so good, it is almost impossible for me gain points from it since I’m already beating the rest of the league in those categories.  Even if I get three wins and 20 strikeouts on any given day, it won’t matter. It’s like being the person who sets the curve on a test. You don’t really benefit because you would have gotten the top grade anyway. The only way I can really gain points is through my hitting, since that is where I have room to improve. But since my hitting sucks so much right now, I rarely ever do better than the people ahead of me in the standings and I rarely ever gain enough points to move up. It’s like ESPN is punishing me for being so awesome at drafting pitchers.</p>\n<p>In fantasy baseball, being the best is bad unless you’re the best at everything (but we all know that’s not true, because if you were you wouldn’t be reading this). If you’re mediocre at everything, then you have both the potential and the capacity to improve as the season goes on. However, if you are the best in a few categories and horrible in others, you are likely going to be stuck in the middle of the pack for the entirety of the season. You won’t quite have the worst team in the league, but having one of the best teams will always be slightly out of your reach.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s good to be bad sometimes. I know its counterintuitive, but just look at George Thorogood. That dude is bad to the bone, but he has tons of money.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus fantasy sports columnist Josh</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-37287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-37287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-27/green-advice-green-people-good-bad/","id":3145,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[3144,3143,3142],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Don’t Overlook Your League’s Overlooked Talent","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Most fantasy owners don’t trust rookies and other smaller names to be consistent.

He’ll get a chance this year. Thus far, he has seen the majority of the starts for San Diego and appears to have locked up the starting job. He isn’t likely to hit .340 for the rest of the season, but his average is not as inflated as it might appear. He is also currently sporting a .397 OBP and a .571 slugging percentage, meaning that he is not simply getting lucky hits. He is making solid contact and is getting on base. Once his numbers come back down to earth, he will continue to be a strong play at catcher.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>David Freese</strong> <em>3B, St. Louis Cardinals: .333 AVG, 2 HR, 9 RBI (Availability: 30.3 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Freese’s rookie season was cut short due to injury, causing his owners grief because of his productivity. Before he went down, he was sporting a .296 average with 36 RBI through 70 games. This season, he has immediately proven that last season was not a fluke. His average and his .481 slugging percentage are slightly inflated, but his OBP is right where it was last year. Even when his other stats come down, he should still maintain an average around .300 and slug about .400, which any fantasy owner would be delighted with — especially for a player they got off the waiver wire. He does tend to strike out more often than he walks, but you can start him with confidence as long as he continues to get on base.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Kyle McClellan</strong> <em>RP, St. Louis Cardinals: 2-0, 1.89 ERA, 1.26 WHIP (Availability: 79.9 percent)</em></p>\n<p>In three starts, he has racked up 13 strikeouts to just six walks and didn’t walk a single batter in his last start. He has also gone at least six innings in all three starts, which means that he is doing a good job of keeping his pitch count relatively low. In his last start, he threw 94 pitches over seven innings to beat the much more well-known Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>\n<p>He has not faced a particularly tough lineup thus far, but his stats — particularly his WHIP — are in line with what they were when he was a reliever. That means that he most likely won’t start giving up a lot of walks and hits each game and will continue to have success as a starter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Jordan Walden</strong> <em>RP, Los Angeles Angels: 0.00 ERA, 0.84 WHIP, 3 SV (Availability: 16.6 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Walden won’t be available for long, but get him if you can. In only his second professional season, he has 10 strikeouts on just four walks and throws in the high 90s. That kind of power and control is a recipe for success in the major leagues, especially for pitchers in the closer role. He has not locked up the job just yet, but it’s his to lose. His only competition is Fernando Rodney, whose control is spotty at best.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mitch Moreland</strong> <em>1B, Texas Rangers: .313 AVG, .389 OBP, .563 SLG (Availability: 32.4 percent)</em></p>\n<p>Last season, his first in the majors, Moreland showed his power potential after belting nine homers and slugging .469 through 47 games. His slugging percentage has increased this season, suggesting that his power has not left him even though he’s only hit one home run so far.  His average has increased significantly from last season, when he hit .255. I’m not saying his average will remain as high as it is, but if he can keep it above .280 he will be one of the top fantasy first basemen.

Long Beach scored back-to-back goals to cut the Gaucho lead in half. Kathryn Nelson scored once more to make the score 5-2 at the half, but in the third quarter CSULB came out and scored two more goals back-to-back. The Gauchos would have gone into the fourth quarter up by just one goal if Haroldson had not scored her second goal just before time ran out.</p>\n<p>That goal would turn out to be the difference. The 49er comeback continued into the fourth quarter as they brought the difference back down to one when play resumed. However, Buchanan, who ended the season on a nine-game scoring streak, scored back-to-back goals to put the game out of reach. Long Beach’s final two goals would not be enough, and the Gauchos escaped with an 8-7 win.</p>\n<p>“We just had to protect the ball and run the clock down and just basically not make any stupid decisions,” senior utility Christie Clark said. “We made good passes and did whatever the coaches said.”</p>\n<p>The next day, the Gauchos traveled to Irvine to face the Anteaters, and after a close first half UCI came out and dominated Santa Barbara to take an 11-5 win. The Gauchos found themselves down 5-2 after the first quarter but were able to silence Irvine’s offense in the second as they cut their deficit down to one goal. In the second half, however, things were very different. Irvine held UCSB scoreless as they increased their lead by five. UCSB mustered one final goal in the fourth, but even if the Anteaters had not responded with their 11th goal it would not have been enough for Santa Barbara to avoid defeat.</p>\n<p>“We took a lot more shots [in the second half], but they weren’t going in,” Nelson said. “It was just bad luck. We can play a lot better than that and we will. Hopefully we see them in the finals and we kick their asses.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have to put the loss behind them quickly, however, as the Big West tournament begins in two weeks. After finishing with a 4-2 conference record, UCSB will receive the three seed and will face the sixth seed, which will either be CSU Long Beach or UC Davis.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host the first match of the tournament, which is scheduled for 4 p.m. on Friday, April 29 .</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36564\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-18/gauchos-close-regular-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36564\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-18/gauchos-close-regular-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-18/gauchos-close-regular-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-18/gauchos-close-regular-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-18/gauchos-close-regular-season/","id":5235,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5234,5233,5232],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Water Polo: Team Heads to OC for Pair of Conference Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 16 UCSB women’s water polo team heads into their final weekend of the regular season set to face off against two conference rivals on the road: No. 19 Long Beach State on Saturday and No. 10...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 16 UCSB women’s water polo team heads into their final weekend of the regular season set to face off against two conference rivals on the road: No. 19 Long Beach State on Saturday and No. 10 UC Irvine on Sunday.

On offense, senior utility Claire Buchanan has scored in eight straight games (all player stats from the game against Cal Baptist were discarded when UCSB was forced to forfeit) — her longest streak of the season, and has scored 17 goals over that period. Senior guard Kathryn Nelson is on a seven-game streak — her second longest of the season — during which she has found the net 14 times.</p>\n<p>“We’re playing two really tough defensive teams this weekend,” Buchanan said. “It’s going to be really important for the other girls to step up and start scoring. We’ve been working on taking outside shots and focusing on [Irvine’s and Long Beach’s] weak goalies. These are our last games on the road, so they’re really important, especially for the seniors.”</p>\n<p>Senior utility Christie Clark is also a force on offense. Her 29 goals this season have brought her career total to 145, just seven away from third place on Santa Barbara’s all-time scoring list.</p>\n<p>“My focus is entirely on the season at this point,” Clark said. “If the record comes that’s awesome, but I’d be happier with a Big West win or an NCAA win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense is anchored by sophomore goalie Ruth Milne, whose 11.47 saves per game ranks first in the conference and whose 265 saves this season are just 10 away from tying her own single season school record.</p>\n<p>“[Ruth] gives the offense a lot of confidence,” Wigo said. “Knowing we have a wall in the gates gives us some leeway and allows us to take some risks that we normally wouldn’t take.”</p>\n<p>This will not be the first time this season that UCSB has faced either UC Irvine or Long Beach State. On Jan. 30, the Gauchos suffered a 9-5 defeat at the hands of the Anteaters and dropped a game against the 49ers 5-2 on Feb. 12.. Winning this weekend will not only get the Gauchos some long-sought revenge, but could also secure them the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>Although Long Beach is 0-2 in conference so far and does not pose much of a threat to the Gauchos in terms of seeding, a win against them and then against Irvine — who is 2-0 in conference — would at least guarantee them the No. 2 seed behind Northridge, who is 3-0 in conference after beating the Gauchos last weekend.</p>\n<p>“The higher seed we have the better schedule,” Wigo said. “If we’re top two we get a bye in the first round, and if we’re No. 3 we have to play the No. 6 seed. So ideally we want to be in the top two, but if we can’t get that we’ll take the third seed.”</p>\n<p>Both games are set to start at noon on their respective days. Once Sunday’s game against Irvine is over, the Gauchos will be idle until April 29<sup> </sup>— the first day of the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36451\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36451\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-15/womens-water-polo-team-heads-oc-pair-conference-matches/","id":5229,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5228,5227,5226],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Not All Underperforming Sluggers Should Be Treated Equally","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"One of the most precarious situations for fantasy owners is when he or she has to deal with that player (or players) that they drafted to be the star on their team but started off the season in a funk...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One of the most precarious situations for fantasy owners is when he or she has to deal with that player (or players) that they drafted to be the star on their team but started off the season in a funk.

However, he is currently batting a meager .225, which may cause some owners to get nervous. This slump will not last. He is already starting to come out of it. He is a career .299 hitter and has not finished any season with worse than a .281 average. Over his last seven games he is hitting a respectable .261, and that average should continue to rise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Lee, 1B, Houston Astros — .225 BA, 1 HR</strong></p>\n<p><em>Be Cautious</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Like Martinez, Lee (a career .287 hitter) has started of his 2011 campaign by carrying a .225 average into the first half of April. However, unlike Martinez, recovery is not certain in this case. Lee will be 35 next month and is in his 12th pro season (compared to Martinez’s 9th). His stats from last season show that his age might be starting to catch up with him, when he finished with a .246 average and fewer than 100 RBI for the first time since 2004. His home run totals have also been decreasing over the last five seasons. Fantasy owners drafted him hoping that last season was a fluke, but this slow start may indicate otherwise. Don’t count him out just yet, but it might be a good idea to feel out trades to see what value you can get for him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Aaron Hill, 2B, Toronto Blue Jays — .186 BA, 0 HR</strong></p>\n<p><em>Panic</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hill followed up a fantastic 2009 campaign with a horrible 2010 season, during which he struggled to keep his average above .200 as fantasy owners hoped desperately for a return to his 2009 production in which he hit .286 with 36 homers and 108 RBI. He is currently hitting .186, with no homers through the first 10 games — a start all too similar to last year’s. Get rid of him if he doesn’t improve over the next couple weeks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Derek Jeter, SS, New York Yankees — .206 BA, .300 OBP, .235 SLG</strong></p>\n<p><em>Panic</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A future hall-of-famer, Jeter was once an unquestioned fantasy starter. Now it appears as if his 16 years of MLB service are finally taking their toll. He finished last season with his worst batting average since his rookie season, and tallied his lowest home run total since 2003. Through his first nine games this season he is hitting just .206 with no homers. While you should not drop him yet, you should keep him out of your lineup until he shows signs of recovery. At this point in his career, he’s more of a fantasy back up anyway.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Adrian Beltre, 3B, Texas Rangers — .205 BA, 3 HR</strong></p>\n<p><em>Don’t Panic</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Beltre was perhaps the most coveted free agent in baseball this offseason, and eventually signed with the Rangers. What he has given them in the early going, however, is not what they expected. While no one expected him to match last season’s production, they also did not expect him to start the season off by hitting .192 up to this point. Don’t panic yet however. His average won’t match last season’s, as he is a career .274 hitter and has only finished with an average above .300 in two seasons. His power, however, has not abandoned him. He has already hit three homers and plays in a very hitter-friendly park. Once his batting average corrects itself, he will be a solid player for the remainder of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Jacoby Ellsbury, OF, Boston Red Sox — .194 BA, .256 OBP, .389 SLG</strong></p>\n<p><em>Don’t Panic</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>After missing the vast majority of last season to injury, Ellsbury came into this season looking to make up for lost time and to return to the form he had in 2009, when he stole 70 bags and hit .301. Right now he is hitting just .194, but that should correct itself. His slugging percentage is not that far from what it was is 2009, but his on base percentage is way down, which suggests he’s simply suffering from bad luck at the moment and that can’t last forever. Ellsbury is still a good source of steals, so stick with him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>David Price, SP, Tampa Bay Rays — 4.85 ERA, 9 K, 2 walks</strong></p>\n<p><em>Be Cautious</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One of the best young pitchers in the league, Price is off to a lukewarm start in 2011. Over two starts, both losses, he has posted a 4.85 ERA and just nine strikeouts. Despite the numbers, there is no cause for concern at this point. He has issued just two walks so far, so his command is not the issue. But while his numbers might improve, wins might be hard to come by when he is backed by an anemic offense. If you can stomach the low win total, Price is still a good play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Daily Nexus fantasy baseball columnist Joshua Greenberg may have struck out this weekend, but there’s no need to panic.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36172\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/green-advice-green-people/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36172\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/green-advice-green-people/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/green-advice-green-people/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/green-advice-green-people/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/green-advice-green-people/","id":2139,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2138,2137,2136],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take Two Losses in Weekend Play, Fall to 2-1 in Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The #15 UCSB women’s water polo team saw its seven-game winning streak snapped on Saturday, falling to CSU Northridge 8-7.

With 3:44 left to go in the first quarter, senior utility Kathryn Nelson scored the first of her eventual four goals of the day, bringing her team-leading total up to 52, tying the game at one apiece. CSUN responded quickly but senior utility Claire Buchanan then notched two goals, extending her scoring streak to eight games to put the Gauchos up 3-2 with about a minute left to play. However, UCSB’s defense could not hold Northridge back, and the second quarter opened with the game tied at three.</p>\n<p>“We know we’re better than them in a regulation pool, but they have a really small pool and it suits their lineup,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “In a small pool we can’t really take advantage of our counter attack, which is one of our strengths. They have a lot of slow players, but their also really good shooters.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The momentum from that goal carried over into the second quarter for the Matadors, as they held UCSB scoreless and took a two-goal lead, which they extended further in the third quarter as they outscored Santa Barbara 2-1. In the final quarter of the game, sophomore utility Bryce Winton scored three goals in seven minutes to lead a furious attempt at a comeback. But the Gauchos fell just short of their eighth consecutive win as Northridge dealt them an 8-7 defeat.</p>\n<p>In the game against Cal Baptist, once again the Gauchos fell behind early. The teams then traded two goals each, including one from Buchanan — who will enter the final weekend of the regular season on a nine-game scoring streak — and the quarter ended with the Lancers up by one.</p>\n<p>Senior utility Christie Clark opened the second quarter with her first goal of the day to tie the game at three, but the Lancers quickly regained the lead. Each team would record one more goal in the quarter and the first half came to a close with the Gauchos down 5-4.</p>\n<p>“I think they just came out and played very physical, and in a small pool like that it was hard to control it,” Clark said. “It was still early in the game so we didn’t have that losing mentality.”</p>\n<p>The Lancers began the second half by taking a two-goal lead over UCSB, which lasted until the 4:50 mark of the third quarter, when sophomore attacker Shelby Haroldson scored to make it a one goal game once again. The Lancers would briefly regain their two-goal lead, but Nelson scored her second goal of the game to start a run of four unanswered goals that lasted into the fourth quarter, giving UCSB a two-goal lead of its own. At this point all UCSB had to do was hold the Lancers off, but with just over a minute left in the game the Lancers would rally to tie it at nine.</p>\n<p>“[Cal Baptist’s comeback] was probably just luck,” Nelson said. “They probably got a lucky shot in and our shots weren’t going in, because we were still playing great defense.”</p>\n<p>Though Cal Baptist was officially credited with a 5-0 win in the match, the game never actually got a chance to end. With 29 seconds left to play, Wigo was given a red card and UCSB was forced to forfeit the game.</p>\n<p>“It’s too early to tell [how the Big West will play out],” Wigo said. “It looks like a lot of teams are beating each other. We definitely have to go down and at least get a split next weekend.”</p>\n<p>Though Santa Barbara went 0-2 on Saturday, there were several bright spots, too. In addition to Winton’s hat trick and Buchanan’s team-leading scoring streak, the Gauchos continued to play strong defense. They have now limited their opponents to nine goals or fewer in ten consecutive games, and sophomore goalkeeper Ruth Milne made 17 saves for the day to keep the games close.</p>\n<p>“[Defense] is very important,” Wigo said. “We just need to keep doing the things that we’re doing right now. We want to keep teams under seven goals and hopefully better than that.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next face off with Long Beach State on Saturday before traveling to Irvine on Sunday for their final game of the regular season. Both games are scheduled to begin at noon.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35719\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/gauchos-losses-weekend-play-fall-21-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35719\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/gauchos-losses-weekend-play-fall-21-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/gauchos-losses-weekend-play-fall-21-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/gauchos-losses-weekend-play-fall-21-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-10/gauchos-losses-weekend-play-fall-21-big-west/","id":5228,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5227,5226,5225],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice: It Must Be Baseball Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Hello again my loyal readers.

To put it simply: scarcity. It’s easier to find starting-quality batters later in the draft than it is to find starting-quality pitching because the MLB contains more elite hitters than pitchers. For example, in this year’s draft, I spent my first three picks on pitchers, namely Josh Johnson of the Marlins, Jon Lester of the Red Sox, and Roy Halladay of the Phillies. What separates pitchers like these from others is that they can help your team in every pitching category while simultaneously posing no risk.</p>\n<p>The next pitcher I took in the draft was Edinson Volquez of the Reds. While not a bad pitcher — he’s a lock for a significant amount of strikeouts — Volquez poses a threat to my team ERA and WHIP every time he takes the mound because of his notorious lack of control. I didn’t take Volquez late in the draft, either; that pick came just a few rounds after I picked up Johnson.</p>\n<p>Pitching talent drops off quickly. Not every MLB team has a legitimate ace on their team, and very few have more than one. That means that if you are playing in a 12-team league like I am, it is possible for all the most reliable pitching to be gone within the first three rounds.</p>\n<p>The same cannot be for hitters. For an MLB team to be successful, they have to assemble a hitting lineup devoid of glaring weak spots. Normally everyone has a few holes, but that means that each team is still contributing about six quality hitters to the world of fantasy sports. Because of this, owners can still pick up players like the Cardinals third-baseman David Freese in the 19th round.</p>\n<p>While Freese’s name does not carry the value of other players like the Rays’ third baseman Evan Longoria, he can still be counted on to provide a batting average of at least .285, around 20 home runs, and upwards of 80 RBI. Those are starting-quality numbers, and he is only my backup. The first pitcher to be taken in the same round in my draft is nationals starting pitcher Jordan Zimmermann, who has been projected to accumulate a grand total of eight wins this season with an ERA close to four. And when I was picking Rangers first baseman Mitch Moreland — who is expected to put up numbers similar to Freese’s — to be my backup at that position, another member of my league was picking Erik Bedard of the Mariners, expected to do even worse than Zimmermann, to be one of his starters at the pitching position.</p>\n<p>The argument could be made that great hitting would offset mediocre hitting. That could be true. I could find later in the season that I made a terrible mistake. Although I did not pick any batters that could hurt me in a scoring category, I also did not pick any that are projected to put up elite numbers. None of my players are projected to finish with a batting average over .299, and none of them are expected to hit more than 29 home runs. But right now, with the season so young, all I have to work with are projections and predictions.</p>\n<p>When my draft was over, ESPN predicted that my team would win my league. I can only attribute this to my strategy in the draft. I stockpiled great pitching early because I knew that I could get the hitting I needed later in the draft. But I also didn’t forget to get useful hitters. It’s all about knowing how to properly assign value, and if something is scarce, like quality pitching, it is more valuable, and you always go after that which is most valuable first.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-35525\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-35525\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-06/green-advice-baseball-season/","id":2137,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2136,2135,2134],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/297"}},"__N_SSG":true}
