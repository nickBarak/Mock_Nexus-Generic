There are defenses out there that have had better individual fantasy days, but few units have been as consistent as this one. The Titans defense has had only two single-digit fantasy outings, and with veteran players like linebacker Will Witherspoon and cornerback Cortland Finnegan leading the defense, that trend is going to continue.</p>\n<p>Best Tight End: Antonio Gates, San Diego Chargers.</p>\n<p>There isn’t anything you can say about this guy that hasn’t been said. Gates has been hauling in touchdowns for the Chargers since 2003, and in a year when the 3-5 Chargers can’t get anything going, he has not slowed down. He has nine touchdowns and only one game without one, and has gotten his fantasy owners 15+ points in five of eight games. He currently has no equal at the position.</p>\n<p>Best Wide Receiver: Calvin Johnson, Detroit Lions.</p>\n<p>It’s between him and Falcons wide receiver Roddy White, but in the end it came down to the fact that Johnson has maintained All-Pro numbers with Shaun Hill running the offense. Now that Matthew Stafford is back from injury, Johnson is going to be unstoppable. Fantasy owners got a taste of what is to come with Sunday’s 101-yard, three-touchdown performance. That’s only the beginning. All hail Megatron.</p>\n<p>Best Running Back: Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings.</p>\n<p>In a world in which Chris Johnson was drafted first, Adrian Peterson is king. After a rather lackluster opening game, Peterson returned to form with a vengeance in week two and since then has continued to prove why he is the best at what he does, which is making defenders look like they just got promoted from Pop Warner. With three 130+ yard rushing days and four 20+ fantasy point days, Peterson has certainly outplayed the inconsistent Johnson, and has been the only bright spot on a dismal Vikings offense.</p>\n<p>Best Quarterback: Peyton Manning, Indianapolis Colts.</p>\n<p>Numbers don’t lie. Manning has tossed 15 touchdowns to just two interceptions, and has thrown for fewer than 300 yards in just three games. No other quarterback has played nearly as well and it’s as simple as that.</p>\n<p>Biggest Surprise: Ryan Fitzpatrick, QB, Buffalo Bills.</p>\n<p>Since taking over the offense in week three, Fitzy has averaged 19.6 points per game, which is better than quarterbacks such as Matt Schaub, Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, and Joe Flacco over the same period of time. Now I don’t know what kind of deal Fitzy had to make with the devil to be able to do what he’s doing, but it was definitely worth it. The 0-7 Bills still have no hope of a playoff spot, but Fitzy has given the fantasy world a Bills player worth starting. That’s surprising enough on its own.</p>\n<p>Biggest Letdown (a.k.a. the Jamarcus Russell Award): Brett Favre, QB, Minnesota Vikings.</p>\n<p>No one was surprised when Favre announced that he was coming back after almost leading the Vikings to a Superbowl just last season, and fantasy owners had good reason to believe that he would be able to, if not duplicate exactly, at least come close to his numbers from last season. However, it would appear that age has finally caught up with Favre, who has managed just one double-digit fantasy day while leading the Vikings to a 2-5 record thus far. You should have stayed retired, Brett.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Joshua Greenberg receives the award for best unsolicited fantasy football advice given by any UCSB student named Joshua Greenberg.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28910\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28910\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-03/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-awards/","id":2871,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2870,2869,2868],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Team Sends Four Players to SoCal Tournament at UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A week after competing in one of college tennis’ toughest tournaments, the ITA Regionals, Head Coach Marty Davis will send four players to UCLA for the 54th annual Southern California Intercollegiat...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A week after competing in one of college tennis’ toughest tournaments, the ITA Regionals, Head Coach Marty Davis will send four players to UCLA for the 54th annual Southern California Intercollegiate Championship.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the oldest college tournaments on the West Coast,” Head Coach Marty Davis said. “The list of past champions is quite impressive.

If they all do that they’ll get a chance to make the NCAA singles.”</p>\n<p>One Gaucho in particular will be looking to continue to build his name up on the national stage. Sophomore Ben Recknagel made it to the Round of 16 a week ago at the ITA Regionals, beating USC’s 90th-ranked Peter Lucassen, along the way. If he continues to play well against nationally ranked players, he will earn a ranking of his own and a spot in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We know he’s going to play one of the [players who makes it past the qualifiers] on Thursday,” Davis said. “That’s always tough because they have already played a couple games. If he wins that he then has a rematch with Peter Lucassen, who he beat at Regionals. It’s a tough draw psychologically, but we’re looking for him to win this thing.”</p>\n<p>Despite the implications of the potential match, Recknagel is not concerned.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously going to be tougher to beat him a second time around,” Recknagel said. “He’s going to prepare for me differently now that he knows I’m good. I know how to play him so I just hope I can beat him again.”</p>\n<p>The tournament will consist of 32 players from schools including UCLA, USC, UCI, UCSB, Denver, Loyola Marymount, BYU and UCSD. USC’s Daniel Nguyen, the #1 seed and runner-up of the ITA Regionals, will also be participating. Sixteen players, including Recknagel and senior Alex Konigsfeldt, will automatically be accepted into the main draw, while the others, including senior Evan Jurgensen and junior Alexander Johnson, will play qualifying matches on Wednesday to determine if they will make the main draw.</p>\n<p>“The level of competitions in the qualifiers is going to be high,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>There will also be a doubles bracket, Recknagel pairing up with Konigsfeldt and Johnson with Jurgensen. Doubles play was a weak point for the Gauchos in the ITA regionals, and they need to step up this week if they want to hold on to a chance to make the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’re hoping to see somebody pop,” Davis said. “We’re going to continue to experiment with pairings and hopefully we’ll find somebody this week. We think that Alex and Evan could be a good pair.”</p>\n<p>This five-day tournament comes just a week after the grueling, six-day-long ITA Regionals, and some people might be worried that fatigue would be a problem for the Gauchos. However, neither Davis nor Recknagel are worried, and both are certain that it won’t be a problem.</p>\n<p>“I think everybody’s feeling a lot better,” Davis said. “The guys made it and survived midterms. I think we’ll feel a lot better psychologically this time.”</p>\n<p>The first matches for the Gauchos will be Jurgensen’s and Johnson’s qualifying matches Wednesday morning. Johnson will face UC Irvine’s Steven Henderson while Jurgensen faces Tyler Loong of BYU.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-11-02/team-sends-players-socal-tournament-ucla/","id":410,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[409,408,407],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Fantasy Shortcomings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I blame you, Ben Roethlisberger.

Following his retirement, I decided that Larry Fitzgerald would be ok, that even without Warner he would still have an elite level season. I thought that even if Matt Leinart didn’t get the job, someone would be able to get the ball to Fitzgerald. So I drafted him. And you know what? I was wrong.</p>\n<p>This season, with the revolving door that has been the Arizona Cardinals’ quarterback position, Fitzgerald has managed just one double-digit fantasy day and has yet to break 100 receiving yards in a game. At this time last year, he had 509 receiving yards and five touchdowns. He currently has 331 receiving yards and just two touchdowns. And as much as it hurts the Cardinals, I think it hurts me more.</p>\n<p>But it is not all Warner’s fault. Oh no, he had an accomplice by the name of Ben Roethlisberger — the quarterback of the Pittsburg Steelers — who was suspended for the first four games of the regular season.</p>\n<p>I knew about his suspension when I drafted Steelers’ receiver Hines Ward. My thinking was similar to what it had been with Fitzgerald that someone would get the ball to Ward. And the upside was that I knew Roethlisberger would eventually return. Once again I was wrong to trust “other” quarterbacks. In the four games the Steelers played without Roethlisberger, Ward had more than three receptions only once, accumulated more than 34 receiving yards only once, and scored just one touchdown.</p>\n<p>In the two games since Roethlisberger’s return, Ward has doubled his total reception yards for the season, scored two touchdowns, and has gotten me a total of 30 fantasy points — 10 more than he got in the previous four games combined. The upside of course is that the season isn’t quite half over yet — I still have a chance to make up for the damage those two have done — but even I’m not happy that Roethlisberger is back. Now it just feels like he’s mocking me.</p>\n<p>Check in next week for my midseason fantasy report to see who had a great first half and who would rather be drinking their sorrows away in Isla Vista on Halloween.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: Ryan Fitzpatrick, QB, Buffalo Bills. He plays for the Bills, I know, but over his last four games he has racked up 20.5 fantasy points, which is more than guys like Peyton Manning and Drew Brees. I’m not sure he’ll keep it up for the rest of the season, but there isn’t any indication that he won’t, and with Tony Romo out for the season, I’m sure a good deal of you people are in need of a quarterback, and Big Fitzy can still be found on free agent lists in 95 percent of ESPN leagues.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist Josh Greenberg’s Halloween is completely ruined by his sub-.500 fantasy squad.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-28420\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-shortcomings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-28420\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-shortcomings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-shortcomings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-shortcomings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-28/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-shortcomings/","id":2865,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2864,2863,2862],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"ITA Tourney Set to Start in Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The 2010 ITA Regional tournament kicks off on Thursday in Irvine, where UCSB men’s tennis will send four of its best players to play against the top players from Big West foes UC Riverside and Cal P...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The 2010 ITA Regional tournament kicks off on Thursday in Irvine, where UCSB men’s tennis will send four of its best players to play against the top players from Big West foes UC Riverside and Cal Poly, along with teams from the Pac-10 and from other California schools.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit id=20037 align=”alignleft” width=”161″]<a href=\"http://www.dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/ita-tourney-set-start-irvine/jsg02apr09_mtennisvscalpoly-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-27809\"><img data-attachment-id=\"27809\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/ita-tourney-set-start-irvine/jsg02apr09_mtennisvscalpoly-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/JSG02Apr09_MTennisvsCalPoly-2.jpg?fit=1684%2C2608&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1684,2608\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"JSG02Apr09_MTennisvsCalPoly-2\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Junior Mathieu Forget flicks a backhand to his opponent last season.

According to Davis, the work his team has put in over the last few weeks could allow UCSB to find success in Irvine.</p>\n<p>“I think all four are capable of having a big tournament,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>In addition to Konigsfeldt, a senior who is seeded 17th in the tournament, Santa Barbara will also send junior Mathieu Forget, Chavez-Goggin and sophomore Benjamin Recknagel. In doubles play, Forget will pair with Chavez-Goggin while Konigfeldt will play alongside Recknagel as the 9th-seeded doubles team in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Because the tournament is so competitive, Davis is insistent that his players take it step by step so they do not overlook anyone.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to win our first round matches,” Davis said. “Everyone in this tournament is so good.”</p>\n<p>In addition to determining the best players in the region, the tournament also has implications on a national level. The winner of the tournament will be awarded an automatic spot in the Indoor Nationals tournament, which showcases the top-32 players in the country.</p>\n<p>According to Davis, the tournament will feature about 90 players, a significant cutback from previous years due to budget cuts. However, he also claimed that would only cause the field to be more selective and more competitive. The top four seeds are, in order, Daniel Nguyen from USC, Nick Meister of UCLA, Chris Kearney from conference rival UC Irvine and Pepperdine’s Sebastian Fanselow, who will be Chavez-Goggin’s opponent in the first round.</p>\n<p>“I know this tournament is so huge that every player every round will be tough,” Chavez-Goggin said. “His ranking doesn’t really matter to me. I just want to come out there playing solid, aggressive tennis.

This means that while they certainly cannot earn you a win by themselves, they will also not hurt you so badly that you will lose because of them.</p>\n<p>I like to start running backs in the flex position. Unlike wide receivers (who can only earn you points if they receive a significant amount of targets from their quarterback), a starting running back, or even one who is in a time share with another back, is usually guaranteed around 15 touches per game. He may not have a huge day, but he will have the opportunity to earn you enough points to push your point total.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at Seattle Seahawks’ running back Justin Forsett. Although officially designated as the team’s starting running back, Forsett has so far been sharing his job, first with Julius Jones, and now with Marshawn Lynch. Despite this unfortunate fact, Forsett has still been averaging just over 12 carries per game, which has translated to over 60 yards per game the last three weeks for an average of over seven fantasy points per week. While it’s not spectacular, it’s also not horrible, and if that yardage is accompanied by a touchdown — as it was in Forsett’s last game — it can mean another six points and a very respectable fantasy day.</p>\n<p>Another example is Chicago Bears’ RB Matt Forté, who despite playing in the pass-first offense of Mike Martz, has been able to average nearly 13 fantasy points per week on an average of fewer than 12 carries.</p>\n<p>If you’re going to start a wide receiver at the flex position, be sure to start someone who gets enough targets to be useful every week, no matter the matchup. Normally, this will end up being a receiver who plays out of the slot position, because quarterbacks trust those receivers to get them out of tight spots. Since every quarterback gets into trouble several times a game, slot receivers are usually targeted often enough to make up for the fact that they don’t get many yards.</p>\n<p>Patriots’ wide receiver Wes Welker is the quintessential flex receiver. Tom Brady trusts him to get open when he needs him to, and so looks his way often in a variety of situations. This trust has led to 33 receptions for Welker so far, setting him on pace for 106 by the end of the season. Because Welker gets targeted so often and has so many receptions, he can be counted on to provided solid fantasy numbers week after week, as can other receivers like him.</p>\n<p>The key to success at the flex position is consistency. While they may not get an enormous amount of touches per game, they get enough work that fantasy owners can hope for at least some points each week. Consistency is exactly what you want out of a flex player, as the flex position is for players who can be trusted to provide enough points to cover your big game players, who tend to be more boom or bust, on days when they, well… bust. Whether you choose to play a running back or a wide receiver, make sure you pick someone you trust not to drop the ball with the game on the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Pick Up of the Week:</strong> While I’d like to recommend Deion Branch, I find it hard to tell people to pick up any Patriots player based off one good week that was probably due to Tom Brady’s tendency to spread the ball around. Instead, I’ll tell you to keep Branch in mind but focus on Detroit Lions’ quarterback Matthew Stafford. When he returns from injury after the Lions’ bye week, he’ll take over an offense that is powered by running back Jahvid Best and wide receiver Calvin Johnson. With his talent and those weapons at his disposal, Stafford could provide a good option for anyone struggling at the QB position. Stafford is still available in 77 percent of leagues, but I have a feeling that’s about to change.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus NFL columnist <em>Josh Greenberg flexes his muscles like the running backs and wide receivers at the flex position.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27704\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27704\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-19/green-advice-green-people-flex-decisions-flexible-people/","id":2808,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2807,2806,2805],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People:  For Every Fantasy Injury, an Upside","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For coaches as well as fantasy owners, an injury to a star player can decimate playoff hopes.

However, you can look at the depth charts.</p>\n<p>It’s the first thing every fantasy owner should do when you first draft players: Know the depth charts of the teams of the players you drafted. You don’t need to spend hours studying rosters. Just know who the second and third string guys are and which player is more likely to step up should your starter sustain an injury. If you have a spot available on your roster, it is also a good idea to pick up one of the backups, just in case that starter does go down.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Let’s start with the Kansas City Chiefs, who recently lost their starting running back, Clinton Portis, for 4-6 weeks. When Portis returns, he could regain at least a share of the starting role.  For now, the Chiefs will probably insert their number two running back, Ryan Torain, into the starting role. In the few opportunities he has been given so far this season, Torain has racked up 156 yards on 41 attempts — over three yards per carry — and one touchdown.</p>\n<p>While last week’s 40-yard performance against Green Bay was disappointing, Torain has shown in previous efforts that he has the ability to get the job done. More importantly, he has the support of Head Coach Mike Shanahan and very little in the way of competition from other guys in the Kansas City depth chart, so he has a lot of value while Portis is out. Torain is still available in almost 20 percent of ESPN leagues, but he is going fast.</p>\n<p>At the wide receiver position, owners of Rams wide receiver Mark Clayton will be disappointed to learn that after injuring his knee on Sunday, Clayton will be forced to miss the rest of the season. However, though his season is lost, his owners still have a chance to salvage theirs. If you look at the Rams’ depth chart you will see that rookie wide receiver Mardy Gilyard, who can be picked up in almost 100% of leagues, is set to take on an extended role in the Rams’ offense. While it is unlikely that Gilyard will instantly match Clayton’s level of production, someone is going to have to catch those extra passes from quarterback Sam Bradford. Gilyard is worth a look from anyone who owned Clayton.</p>\n<p>That same rule applies for owners of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who may not be able to play in week six. If you have no other viable replacement, Packers backup QB, rookie Matt Flynn, would be a wise add for this week — if only as a precaution. In the event that Rodgers can’t play, Flynn will take over the offense for the week and for that reason could provide a solid fantasy performance for any owner willing to gamble on him.</p>\n<p>Knowing who stands to replace who in the event of an injury is all fine and dandy, but it will only get you so far if you don’t understand how individual coaches handle injuries. This brings us to the second point in dealing with injuries: Know how different coaches react to losing a starter. Some coaches will simply put in the guy who is next on the depth chart and wait until the starter returns. Others, however, are not that simple.</p>\n<p>Saints Head Coach Sean Peyton exemplifies a coach who tends to replace injured starters with committees of healthy players, making it difficult to know who is going to get the bulk of the work from week to week. Peyton, for example, has chosen to fill the hole left by starting running back Pierre Thomas with a committee of Ladell Betts and Chris Ivory. Although Betts has been productive on his own in the past, it will be difficult to predict how often he will touch the ball while sharing carries with Ivory. This ends up negating any potential value of either player, since neither can be relied upon to produce consistently. Any owner who picks up either Betts or Ivory without first knowing how Peyton deals with injuries would be making a mistake.</p>\n<p>Star players get injured just like anyone else. In all likelihood, you won’t find other stars to replace them. Still, most owners fail to take into account the fact that someone needs to fill the void that the injured player left on his team, and that the replacement player will have value as long as the star is injured. By knowing how coaches like to handle injuries and who is next in line on the depth chart, you may be able to prevent an injury from harming your playoff chances. Real men may play through injuries, but real fantasy owners work around them.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>Staff Writer Josh Greenberg is a real man and a real fantasy owner.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27325\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27325\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-13/green-advice-green-people-fantasy-injury-upside/","id":2786,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2785,2784,2783],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tennis Team Set to Start With ITA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last season saw the UCSB women’s tennis team reach a mark of 13-11 and 6-3 in conference, only to fall to UC Irvine in the semifinals of the Big West Conference Championship.

Friday morning will mark the start of the first annual Santa Barbara Classic and the beginning of the Gauchos’ quest for redemption.</p>\n<p>“It was a tough match that could have gone either way,” Head Coach Pete Kirkwood said. “We really believe we could have won that match. It raised our expectations for this year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has good reason to expect a lot this season. Not only are they returning three of their five All Big-West players, this season also marks the return of senior Michelle Murphy, who, after playing in the number-one singles position and earning 2nd team All Big West honors as a sophomore, decided not to return to the team during her junior year. Now that she’s back, Kirkwood is confident that he has enough veterans to lead a team that is loaded with young talent.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“[Freshman] Kiersten Meehen has been a great surprise,” Kirkwood said. “She’s played really well and is challenging for number one on our team. We’re doing great things in the fall and we’re got a few more players coming in. We’re loaded this season.”</p>\n<p>Though stacked with talent, the Gauchos have yet to test themselves in competitive action so far this season. On Friday, however, they will find out how well they handle the pressure.</p>\n<p>“We just want to see if we play any different against outside competition,” Kirkwood said. “This is the first test, especially for the freshmen. We’ve got the ITA Regionals coming up and it’s always good to go into that tournament with a few matches under your belt because that tournament can make you famous.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will be competing against players from the University of Arizona, Pepperdine, Cal Poly, Brigham Young University, Eastern Washington University and the University of Denver. The number-one seed in the tournament is Pepperdine’s Ally Walters. With such stiff competition in their first tournament of the season, Kirkwood is glad to have the home court advantage.</p>\n<p>“It’s just good for our players,” Kirkwood said. “It’s always good when you can sleep in your own bed. The advantage is on their side.”</p>\n<p>The tournament is split into three flights, both for singles and doubles, in order to better manage the number of players. For singles play, Meehen and Murphy, along with juniors Jill Damion and Jordan Dockendorf, will compete in the A Flight. The B Flight will be composed of Casey Reede and sophomore Erica Cano, while Samantha Chou and junior Alexandra McIntosh make up the C Flight. Junior Natalia Lozano will also compete, but only in doubles play as a member of the A Flight. The tournament will begin Friday morning at 10 a.m. with the first round of doubles matches.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26988\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-08/tennis-team-set-start-ita/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26988\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-08/tennis-team-set-start-ita/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-08/tennis-team-set-start-ita/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-08/tennis-team-set-start-ita/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-08/tennis-team-set-start-ita/","id":299,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[298,297,296],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Regretting Draft Picks?

I know why you did it. I know it’s not your fault. Moss was coming off a season in which he accumulated 13 touchdowns and almost 1,300 yards, all with quarterback Tom Brady still recovering from an ACL tear. It was logical to assume that with a healthy Brady running the offense, Moss would have no problem eclipsing last season’s numbers. Those of you who believed this have been duped.</p>\n<p>So far, Brady’s throwing to anyone but Moss, who has accumulated a total of nine receptions for 139 yards, including a grand total of zero receptions in Monday night’s game against the Miami Dolphins.</p>\n<p>At this point, Moss owners have two options: Bench Moss and hope he turns it around or abandon ship and trade him.</p>\n<p>Trading a high profile player like Moss can be a difficult thing to do, but the longer you wait the less likely you are to get good value for him. I can guarantee you that in your league there is at least one owner in need of a wide receiver, and that same owner may still believe that Moss will turn his season around. If you act now, you may still be able to trade Moss and receive good value for him in return.</p>\n<p>However, most fantasy owners are not stupid. They might call your bluff. To sweeten the deal you might want to add into the mix one of your bench players who could fill a need on their team. The downside of this is that you now are losing two players, but in the end it will be worth it to have a productive player in Moss’s place. This plan can be used to deal with any big name player performing like Moss. Remember, a little trickery every now and then never hurt anyone… except the person being tricked.</p>\n<p>In any case, the second type of headache player is a bit more difficult to deal with. Titan running  back Chris Johnson provides the perfect example. Looking at the record-breaking numbers of Johnson’s 2009 season, his average draft position of 1.4 for this season seems justified. However, despite a couple of good performances, Johnson has been wildly inconsistent, as any fantasy owner unlucky enough to draft him first will tell you. He should not have been drafted one spot ahead of Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, who has been much more consistent this season.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is unlikely that you will be able to get good value for Johnson in a trade. He is still one of the best players at his position, and he has the talent to turn his season around. But until he does, you should consider benching him for a more consistent performer, because as it is Johnson is just as likely to hurt you as he is to help you.</p>\n<p>Everyone has their draft day regrets. There is no such thing as a perfect draft because there are just too many factors outside the fantasy owner’s control. No one can account for injuries or unexpected slumps.</p>\n<p>What matters is how you deal with the rotten spots on your roster. If you deal with your underachievers soon enough, you may be able to prevent them from doing irreparable harm to your record.</p>\n<p>Make trades, work the waiver wire, watch for favorable matchups and adjust your lineup to make sure you trust your starting players to perform.</p>\n<p>Lastly, make sure no one tricks you into making a bad trade. It’s all fun and games until someone gets Randy Moss.</p>\n<p>Pick Up of the Week: BenJarvus Green-Ellis, RB, New England. Yes, the Patriots are on a bye week, but don’t let that stop you from grabbing Green-Ellis while you still can. So far, he succeeded where Laurence Maroney failed and has somehow convinced Bill Belichick to give him the ball consistently. He is still available in almost 30 percent of ESPN leagues and can provide you with good value at running back.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26904\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26904\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-06/green-advice-green-people-regretting-draft-picks/","id":2287,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2286,2285,2284],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Tennis Ready for Final","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, the UCSB men’s tennis team traveled up north to Fresno to compete in the Bulldog Classic, a three-day tournament held at Fresno State University.

Guys can’t catch up with his fastball in the first set, but kind of pick up on it in the second set.”</p>\n<p>Forget also had a disappointing tournament. After making it to the semifinals, his match came down to two match points, at 40-15 and at 40-30 in the third set. Forget dropped both points and his opponent, Jean-Charles Diame of Fresno State, took the match on the tiebreaker point and knocked Forget out of the tournament.</p>\n<p>“[Mathieu] had the guy on the ropes,” Davis said. “[He] had two chances to win it. On the first one the guy hit a spectacular drop shot. The guy basically gambled on the two match points and came up big. In the tiebreaker [he] played a couple of nervous points, and when he lost the tiebreaker you could definitely see a drop in energy.”</p>\n<p>In the Gauchos’ B Flight, three Gauchos — freshmen Adam Luba and Axel Bouillin and senior Evan Jurgensen — made it to the semifinals.</p>\n<p>“I think [our success came from] fitness,” Davis added. “It was really hot. The on court temp was probably well over 100. They were on course most of the day.”</p>\n<p>Because only four players move on to the semifinal round, Boullin and Luba squared off against each other in what Davis called a “very competitive” match. Boullin won in three sets and earned a spot in the finals. In the other semifinal match, Jurgensen faced off against Jurgen De Jager of Cal Poly. Jurgensen won the first set 6-4, but then dropped the second set 4-6. In the third set Jurgensen reached deep into the tank and managed take the set 7-5. According to Davis, Jurgensen’s superior fitness allowed him to win the match and move on to and all-Gaucho final that will be played at UCSB at 3:15 p.m. today.</p>\n<p>“It’s two Gauchos in the finals, so I’ll be an innocent bystander,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s three doubles teams were all eliminated in the second round.</p>\n<p>“It was a good tournament because everyone won at least one match, and the freshmen got some wins too, so that was really positive for them,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>After Monday’s match the Gauchos will be off until Oct. 21, when they will travel to Irvine to compete in the six-day long ITA Regionals.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The upcoming Classic represents the beginning of UCSB’s quest to avenge that loss and get back to the national stage.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Marty Davis, who was recently named UCSB’s Director of Tennis and was also inducted into the Northern California Tennis Hall of Fame in July, has been working his team hard in preparation for the Classic.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been doing two-a-day workouts,” Davis said. “Our training has been vigorous and physical. I think the guys are really quite sore. Even the bus ride to Fresno is going to be a nice rest for them. I think we’re as prepared as we can be given that we’ve only been together for a few weeks.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, the Classic represents an opportunity not only to establish them in the conference early on, but also to learn about themselves and their opponents.</p>\n<p>“I think I’ll learn more about our team than the competition,” Davis said. “We’ll have almost all new doubles teams this year so we’ll learn about that. Also, we’ll see how the freshmen deal with the pressure.”</p>\n<p>The 2010 Gauchos return four seniors and all seven of their players who were named to last season’s All Big West team. According to Davis, however, last season’s conference champion UC Irvine is the favorite to win the title again this year, and Cal Poly is also going to contend.</p>\n<p>“Our conference is getting better and that’s good for us,” Davis said.</p>\n<p>Though they face a hard road ahead of them if they want to make it back to the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos still have high expectations for themselves. After losing their first Big West tournament in four seasons, the Gauchos want to regain control of the conference.</p>\n<p>“As long as we don’t start thinking about other schools, results or rankings and just keep focusing on ourselves, I’m sure we have a great chance to reach our goals and expectations,” Recknagel said.</p>\n<p>The Bulldog Classic will begin this Friday and end on Sunday, with  the opening matches set to start at 9 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26507\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/gaucho-tennis-set-start/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26507\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/gaucho-tennis-set-start/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/gaucho-tennis-set-start/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/gaucho-tennis-set-start/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-30/gaucho-tennis-set-start/","id":294,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[293,292,291],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Green Advice for Green People: Player Rankings Overrated","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Fantasy football Web sites like www.espn.go.com like to make a big deal out of their player rankings.

To view them just on a basis of names, it would seem as though player value begins to drop off around the 10th spot on each list. But if you look carefully, you will find low-ranked players who still produce solid numbers and may even still be available in your league.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at ESPN’s rankings. On its list of the top quarterbacks, ESPN has Matt Schaub of the Houston Texans ranked 6th, while Chad Henne of the Miami Dolphins is ranked 14 spots lower at #20. Schaub has almost 200 more yards passing than Henne, has a higher QB rating, and has thrown for two more touchdowns, making it seem as though Schaub is the obvious choice over Henne. But to be a successful fantasy owner, you are going to need to look a bit deeper. Take Henne and Schaub. Despite his numbers, Schaub has only scored nine more fantasy points than Henne. Why? Interceptions. Schaub has thrown four interceptions to Henne’s one. </p>\n<p>So while Schaub has had the more explosive season, he is also more likely to hurt you fantasy-wise. And while Schaub is owned in 100 percent of ESPN leagues, Henne is still available in almost 33 percent of leagues. The contrast is even more striking when you compare Henne to ESPN’s #11 quarterback, Eli Manning, who, despite also being owned in 100 percent of ESPN leagues, has actually put up fewer fantasy points than Henne. It is because of players like Henne that free agency can be an owner’s best friend. Every now and then there will be a player who is flying under the radar but is still producing at the level of a highly ranked player. If you pay attention, you might find one.</p>\n<p>Here are a few more numbers. Maurice Jones-Drew, running back for the Jacksonville Jaguars, is ESPN’s fourth-ranked running back. He has scored a grand total of 20 fantasy points and is owned in 100 percent of leagues. The 40th and 41st ranked running backs, Jason Snelling and Mike Tolbert, have put up 41 and 29 fantasy points respectively, and are both still available in almost 40 percent of leagues. St. Louis Rams wide receiver Mark Clayton, who can still be picked up in 23 percent of leagues, is ranked 30th by ESPN despite scoring nine more fantasy points than sixth-ranked receiver Greg Jennings.</p>\n<p>My point is this: Just because you missed out on the top ten players does not mean you can’t put together a strong team. Instead of memorizing all the bullshit the analysts at ESPN or any other fantasy football site come up with, do some actual research. Track performances each week and keep a close eye on the free agents in your league, because more likely than not, you will find something that somebody else missed.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus staff writer Josh Greenberg spends his days trolling free angency lists, and absolutely nothing else.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26209\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26209\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-29/green-advice-green-people-player-rankings-overrated/","id":2304,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[2303,2302,2301],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Irvine No Match for Dominant UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB women’s volleyball concluded a five-week road trip over the weekend with matches at CSU Northridge on Friday and at UC Irvine on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB women’s volleyball concluded a five-week road trip over the weekend with matches at CSU Northridge on Friday and at UC Irvine on Saturday.

They dropped the third game 25-19, and according to Gregory, completely lost their focus in that game.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes it’s bad to go up 2-0,” Gregory said. “You start to have no fear and you relax.”</p>\n<p>Despite the errors, the Gauchos had a chance to end the match in the fourth game, leading 12-8 at one point. However, three consecutive serving errors allowed the Matadors back into the game, and they managed to eke out 26-24 win over UCSB.</p>\n<p>If they wanted the win, the Gauchos needed to come out strong in the fifth game. Playing as if the previous two games had not happened, UCSB never trailed in the final game, cruising to a 15-10 win to take the match 3-2. Junior Stacey Schmidt scored the final point on her career-high 23rd kill of the game.</p>\n<p>“I said [to the team], ‘You know what? We made some dumb mistakes. We just need to get our focus back and stop giving them points,’” Gregory said. “Stacey is our biggest offensive threat. She’s hitting close to .300. She’s very versatile and is key to our game.”</p>\n<p>The next day the team traveled to Irvine to face off with the Anteaters, who proved to be no match for Santa Barbara. The Gauchos never trailed by more than two throughout the match, and swept UCI for the first time since 2005.</p>\n<p>“[It was nice because] we haven’t had a 3-0 sweep this season,” Gregory said. “Knowing that Irvine is a team that we competed with last year and we had to go to five [sets] with, it was very nice that we were able to play in that gym.”</p>\n<p>Now 8-6 overall, the Gauchos will next face CSU Long Beach in their first home game since Aug. 30. According to Gregory, the fact that the Gauchos are coming home with a winning record and two Big West wins will prove to be very important as they move deeper into the conference portion of their season.</p>\n<p>“[Getting those wins] is very important because it was on the road and those games are harder to win,” Gregory said. “We’ve been on the road for five weeks. I feel very fortunate.”</p>\n<p>UCSB faces off against Long Beach in the Thunderdome on Friday at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-26060\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-26/irvine-match-dominant-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-26060\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-26/irvine-match-dominant-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-26/irvine-match-dominant-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-26/irvine-match-dominant-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-09-26/irvine-match-dominant-ucsb/","id":5552,"author":{"id":297,"name":"Joshua Greenberg"},"related":[5551,5550,5549],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/297"}},"__N_SSG":true}
