Since the storm, the island has been struggling to return electricity to people’s homes, provide clean water and rebuild damaged infrastructure. As many mainlanders have heard, basic needs are still not being met. Last time I spoke to my abuelo, he said islanders living in remote areas still don’t have access to clean drinking water since the storm. After the hurricane, my family on the mainland had to wait six months to hear from our relatives on the island. When we finally heard back from my abuelo, he told us that the family farm (which my Puerto Rican family relies on for food and income) was destroyed and that all the animals were gone. He showed little worry despite the destruction, even calling himself a “lucky one” for surviving the storm with his brother, sister, nephew and three-year-old granddaughter by his side. Unfortunately, many others on the island have not been so lucky.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perception of Puerto Rico’s crisis has only been worsened by Trump’s tweets and numerical claims in regards to the hurricane and debt. At first, Puerto Rico’s government </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/puerto-rico-governor-raises-hurricane-maria-death-toll-from-64-to-2975\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inaccurately reported 64 deaths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; after backlash from the community, who noted nearly 3,000 deaths, the number was corrected. However, Trump denies the number is correct and claims the jump in deaths </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/13/17855268/trump-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-tweets\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was something of “magic.”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump also falsely </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1151867785368281089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1151867786236440576&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump%2Ffact-check-trump-says-puerto-rico-got-92-billion-they-n1031276\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweeted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Puerto Rican government had “foolishly” received </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-says-puerto-rico-got-92-billion-they-n1031276\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$92 billion dollars in relief aid</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In reality, $92 billion dollars is the estimated cost for what the island would need to be fully restored. Even so, </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-says-puerto-rico-got-92-billion-they-n1031276\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congress cut that number in half,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> declaring in courts that the Puerto Rican government will receive $42.5 billion in aid. However, almost three years have passed and only $14 billion has been received, which many people have accused </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of mismanaging.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mismanagement, and one of the most tragic public spending cuts the island has ever seen, was the permanent shutdown of one quarter of Puerto Rico’s public schools</span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/15/17455746/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-schools-closing\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last June</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This decision was made by Julia Keleher, the Secretary of Education appointed by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In total, 254 schools have been closed indefinitely, which has displaced 60,000 K-12 students. Moreover, many of the school closures have affected remote areas where local communities rely heavily on public schools to unify children, parents and teachers to foster a constructive upbringing for disadvantaged children. Keleher stood by her decision, </span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/15/17455746/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-schools-closing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claiming</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “We saw in the redesign as a unique opportunity to improve the system in an inclusive, respectful and sensitive way.” </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-puerto-rico-bankruptcy-20170505-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Facebook comment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in response sums up the community’s feelings about school shutdowns: “No to the closing of schools. If they want to save money, then reduce the salary for themselves and stop playing with the children’s education.” What’s worse is that the school closures have disproportionately affected children living in low-income communities who were hit hardest by the hurricane. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No to the closing of schools. If they want to save money, then reduce the salary for themselves and stop playing with the children’s education.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At any rate, there are many complex issues to be dealt with on the island. At times, it’s difficult to imagine transformative change, especially considering the government’s overwhelming debt. However, after the resignation of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> optimism is at an all-time high. The win of the people sparked massive celebration. I even saw my own father become emotional with relief when he heard the news. He expressed his feelings to me over FaceTime, tearing up: “I’m so happy we got to see this in our shared lifetime. Through everything Puerto Ricans have been through, peaceful protest is able to bring change. It can happen!” I realized my dad was right. These protests were not about reacting to a scandal; they were truly a lesson. They were proof that civic action can foster real change. In any case, they serve as a much needed reminder to Americans that in a democratic state you do not have to settle for leadership you don’t approve of, and you can fight against a system of corruption in a peaceful manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking forward, many Puerto Ricans are wondering what the future government will look like. And if you weren’t wondering yourself, you should, considering that all of the billions in relief aid being given to Puerto Rico’s government, come directly from the American taxpayers. Unfortunately, the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/07/10/fbi-makes-arrests-puerto-rico-corruption-scandal-prompting-calls-governors-ouster-concerns-about-billions-storm-aid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple arrests </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">since the scandal have created a hole in Governor </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rosselló’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> line of succession.
