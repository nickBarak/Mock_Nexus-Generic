I live in Santa Catalina (let’s call it what it is… FT), in the North Tower, on the ground floor. I’m a biology major and I’m from Newport Beach… what about you?” Unfortunately, as old as that back-and-forth may get, it really is a vital conversation starter for us freshmen.  In that 30-second conversation we find out whether we have anything in common with these people, and from there we find people to hang out with.</p>\n<p><span>[media-credit id=20201 align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/freshmenopinion_JM2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1803637154\" data-slb-group=\"27285\"><img data-attachment-id=\"27286\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/perks-freshman/freshmenopinion_jm2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/freshmenopinion_JM2.jpg?fit=452%2C293&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"452,293\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"freshmenopinion_JM2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/freshmenopinion_JM2.jpg?fit=250%2C162&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/freshmenopinion_JM2.jpg?fit=452%2C293&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/freshmenopinion_JM2-250x162.jpg?resize=250%2C162\" alt=\"\" title=\"freshmenopinion_JM2\" width=\"250\" height=\"162\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-27286\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/freshmenopinion_JM2.jpg?resize=250%2C162&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/freshmenopinion_JM2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/freshmenopinion_JM2.jpg?w=452&amp;ssl=1 452w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</span>As a freshman, I feel as if I can speak for many of us in that we try as hard as we can to not look like freshmen. For instance, the other day I was in the library trying to finish some chemistry summer work.  After I finished up, I decided I would walk around and figure out where all my classes were.  I then went up to the front desk and looked the attendant in the eye and asked, “Can I have a map of the campus?” Never have I felt so much like a noob in my entire life.  But then I remember that we are, in fact, freshmen, which means that we have four more years of this wonderful place.</p>\n<p>I have a thing or two to say to all you upperclassmen that run by the dorms and scream, “F@*$ FRESHMAN!!!” It’s OK, if I were an upperclassman, I would want to be a freshman too. We know you’re jealous. You can act as if you’re not, but it is well known that many people wish they could be a freshman in college again. This is the first time (for most of us) we are completely on our own.  This first year is a year we don’t have anyone to tell us what we can and cannot do. Everything — for purpose of this article — is paid for, and we can’t really get in too much trouble. Also, we are a staple of what UCSB is; we are what make this school so unique. So next time when you run by, maybe think about how much you honestly miss being a freshman, and then yell whatever barbaric obscenities you must.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27285\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/perks-freshman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27285\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/perks-freshman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/perks-freshman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/perks-freshman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-14/perks-freshman/","id":5995,"author":{"id":582,"name":"Zachary Cabin"},"related":[5994,5993,5992],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/582"}},"__N_SSG":true}
