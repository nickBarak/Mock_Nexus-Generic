I’m excited and honored to announce that tonight we can continue and uphold that legacy with some of the most radical organizers I know,” Gessesse said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gessesse urged students in attendance to support the hosts through Patreon, the content creator crowdfunding service, as few publicly funded resources exist for this kind of political education, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without the funds we really can’t be free and educate our people, which is something I really admire about their labor,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham, in his opening remarks, addressed the audience on his and Simons’ intention to establish a safe and inclusive space for the duration of their show.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Definitely want to start by acknowledging this room is a safe space for all Black folks, we’re not free until all of us are free. If you’re not with that shit, y’all know where the exits are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham said he decided to start the podcast after graduating with a degree in journalism and spending a week with his mentor in New York, who was already a podcaster. He recalled being repulsed that the superficial commentary and focus on trivial issues by white men received obscenely high compensation, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All I seen was hella white men talking about shit that didn’t matter. It’s disgusting when you see how much white folks get paid for their bad ideas,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham and Simons called attention to their organization, the People’s Breakfast Oakland, stating that merely talking about Black issues was inadequate when people are not addressing material needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s important that we engage in these communities that we claim to serve … what are you doing besides just talking about shit?” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tradition for the podcast, Parham and Simons began the night with their segment called “Black Joy,” where the co-hosts highlight a recent positive experience in their lives in-between episodes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A part of the Black burden is life being constantly born into the struggle, everything we do is politicized, everything we do gotta be serious [and] everything we do gotta be for liberation,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the reasons why we start the podcast [this way] is to center joy and having joy in the movement is important. Black joy, not that white shit, that hella Black joy,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons then addressed the contradiction of being an individual Black student charting their own educational path, particularly in a predominantly white institution, with the reality that the mass struggle of Black people is why they are allowed to attend, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We go to these institutions but what is the institution telling us to do? Who is the institution training us to become? Are we going to get a degree and work at Goldman Sachs or are we going to get a degree and help our people?” Simons said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a recurring theme throughout the live show; Simons and Parham said that as educated, radical organizers, they believe in the importance of Black students putting into practice the knowledge they gain in higher education in order to benefit their communities.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What can you do as a Black student to advance the next generations of people, because there will [always] be another 18-year-old or 17-year-old. How can you make this campus more inclusive to them?”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons brought up his time as a BSU organizer at UC Berkeley, and Parham discussed his reporting of the BSU’s fight for institutional change at the university to benefit Black students. These actions led to the creation of the Fannie Lou Hamer Black Resource Center at UC Berkeley.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham encouraged students to remain resolute and aware of the importance of their activism and its precedent in the Black struggle, claiming “don’t let these crackers sway you, period, point blank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In thinking about Black students and [their] activism, we really have to demand and always keep carrying that torch forward because when we stop carrying that torch, Black students are going to drop off,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What can you do as a Black student to advance the next generations of people, because there will [always] be another 18-year-old or 17-year-old. How can you make this campus more inclusive to them?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair commented on the developing situation and statement from the UCSB’s BSU Demands Team, who have been fighting for a black resource and development center over the past 50 years. UCSB recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">addressed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and agreed to meet several of the BSU’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons advised Black students to fight for their people on and off-campus as well, thinking about those who cannot afford to attend college. Simons reiterated his and Parham’s stance on Black students using their education to advance the cause of their people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you can’t explain these theories that you’re learning to your cousin or to your grandma, what good is that theory? What good is talking if you ain’t taking action?” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hosts then offered their thoughts on the forthcoming election campaigns for President of the United States, particularly on Kamala Harris. The duo made clear their denunciation of </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/19/kamala-harris-2020-election-top-cop-prosecutor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her politics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, skeptical of other current black leadership and critical of purely elections-based politics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of us as Black people can’t seem to recognize anti-Blackness and white supremacy outside of whiteness,” Parham said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham added, before pressing further into the subject, that a rejection of any commentary about Kamala Harris that is grounded in misogynoir, which is sexism or misogyny targeting Black women specifically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parham and Simons had harsh words for Barack Obama as well, believing that he furthered an oppressive system that subjugates people that look like him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s] strategic, I always tell people ‘Obama was the best chess move for white supremacy,’ because you can put a Black face on it and it’s still going to do its job,” Simons said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two weaved together past and contemporary history, using the words of Black leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X to highlight their thoughts regarding integration and the dichotomy of</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zLQLUpNGsc\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ballot or the bullet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simons concluded with some words about the power of history, and its necessity in understanding the trajectory of revolutionary struggle and the questions which arise from this process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We come from a perspective, a revolutionary perspective, right? When we think about these systems we have to understand the history, it ain’t just an individual,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why can’t we have free food, why can’t we have free healthcare, why can’t we have free housing, why do we give billions and billions of dollars to Israel to fund the occupation of Palestine, but we have people here living on the streets?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simon said that Black people must ultimately ask, “What does it mean to be a revolutionary?”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins led the Los Angeles and New Haven chapters of the Black Panther Party for 14 years after she originally joined in 1968, </span><a href=\"https://www.erickahuggins.com/bio\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to her website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Black Panther Party was a </span><a href=\"https://www.freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/Black%20Liberation%20Disk/Black%20Power!/SugahData/Books/Cleaver.S.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seeking the liberation of all oppressed peoples by toppling capitalism, according to their former Minister of Information, Eldridge Cleaver.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Black Panther Party was known for its radical approach to organizing and meeting the material needs of Black and other oppressed groups with free breakfast and groceries programs, free clinics, political education and armed protection from police abuse according to </span><a href=\"https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/longmoreinstitute/bundles/230640\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">former chairwoman of the Party Elaine Brown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexandra Gessesse, UCSB’s Black Student Union financial director, introduced Huggins that night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ericka Huggins taught herself to meditate as a means to survive incarceration … since then she incorporated spiritual practice into her community work and as a speaker and facilitator, teaching it as a tool for change,” Gessesse said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins started off her lecture on the topic of having an “attitude of gratitude,” which over the years helped ease the pain of incarceration and being subjected to solitary confinement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you feel like a speck of pepper in a sea of rice, remember gratitude,” Huggins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This also served as her first of many motions for audience participation, asking those in attendance to reflect briefly on someone or something they are grateful for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins prefaced her later remarks on identity, activism and change by describing what it means to be aware of humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most all the isms — sexism, racism [and] classism — all of them are really not based in hatred. They look like they’re hateful, but they’re based in fear. Which is an irrational emotion for any of us to have.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins further posited that said “isms” aren’t to be attributed to individuals but to the institutions that manufacture and reproduce them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s structural … Remember that no one man or woman or group of men and women is responsible. It was here before they got here and before the ones before them,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins then segued into identity from these statements, pointing out the significance of coinciding identities existing in one body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if we say my identity is human, which it is for all of us, there are other identities folded in … all in this one body,” Huggins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you are a man and a gay man, those are coinciding identities. If you are a man and you are heterosexual, [those are] coinciding identities. When the two men meet there could be some learning there … if our socialization didn’t get in the way of the two men talking, and that socialization teaches us to be fearful of what we don’t know.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins transitioned into discussing activism, first by explaining what it meant to embody the essence of activism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Activism is what you do, how you participate in creating the transformation you want to see in this world. In other words it’s the dues you pay for taking up space on the planet.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is not a monolithic thing … [but] it needs to be a little bit beyond Facebook, okay,” said Huggins, joking with the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins, in between her humor, didn’t leave out the somber reality that can accompany activism, particularly of people like herself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe you think that an activist has to live the kind of life that I lived. You don’t want my life. I assure you. It’s not romantic. It’s not pretty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins spoke about change and transformation, noting her time in Upstate New York, learning from children who were researching the life cycle of a butterfly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t just change. They transform,” Huggins said a boy exclaimed to her at the time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins connected this anecdote to her and the Black Panther Party’s struggle for a transformation of society beyond the previous change achieved in the 1960s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A change would be civil rights, which are the rights you are due by law … human rights, if they’re honored, would be the rights you are due by your very birth. That is transformation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huggins laced the concepts of identity, activism and change together by advising the audience to step outside of the boxes built up around them and rejecting those imposed upon others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whatever you were told about yourself and about others, if it doesn’t hold them up as fully human, you can let go of it … The universe won’t dissolve into the cosmos if we let go of some old, tired, whatever it is, but it’s important that we begin because freedom, is an inside job.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few students after the lecture offered their thoughts on which passages resonated most with them, and discussed the connection to the current political climate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wish the talk was longer because every time I thought I knew something, her views on life told me different,” Aryn Jackson, a third-year communication major said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson related to Huggins’ belief that no one identity can fully explain the qualities of a person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nashelle Brown, a third-year film and media studies major, related the lecture to political polarization in the U.S. She pointed out that immense tension can impede change as well as the transformation that Huggins defined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brown’s favorite quote encapsulates Huggins’ lasting message of the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“None of these privileges are anyone’s fault; it’s how we use it.”</span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the Feb. 28, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus<i>.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-84758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Food for All Coalition held its first meeting at the Biko Garage on Friday. <em>Laila Voss / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The coalition – made up of various students groups dedicated to fighting food insecurity – was created last October following the UCSB Food Security and Sustainable Food Systems Leadership Retreat.</p>\n<p>“[The retreat] was awesome; it was having everyone together because that never happens [and] we were drafting different ideas,” Michaela Austin said, a fourth-year sociology and environmental studies double major and student ambassador for the UC Global Food Initiative, said.</p>\n<p>The retreat brought together student organizations including the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank, CalFresh, the UC Global Food Initiative, the Edible Campus Program, FoodCycling, Food, Nutrition, and Basic Skills Program, the Food Security Taskforce Student Reps, ECOalition and Food Security Peer Advisors.</p>\n<p>For Austin, who presided over Friday’s meeting, the goal of the coalition was obvious.</p>\n<p>“[The purpose is] very simple. Update each other, build coalition[s] and again, the goal is to get food insecurity on campus to as low a rate as possible,” Austin said. “If there is a problem we all agree on, let’s go to the UC with a unified voice.”</p>\n<p>Some of the positive updates and successful programs on- and off-campus were discussed at the opening of the meeting as well.</p>\n<p>Gabriel Etaat highlighted the achievements of the CalFresh Advocacy Team and the A.S. Food Bank. He explained that the CalFresh Advocacy Team had over 76 engagement activities during Fall Quarter 2018, which included tabling and enrollment parties.</p>\n<p>“We got well over 2,000 people enrolled in CalFresh that we know of through the program and this year’s benchmark is 6,000,” Etaat, a fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major and USDA Food Insecurity Research intern, said.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, several students also discussed the accessibility of food security and sustainability programs are to underserved students. Marilu Bedolla, a fourth-year language, culture and society major, noted that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients are unable to access CalFresh.</p>\n<p>Due to their ineligibility for the federal program, which has no locally funded alternative, undocumented students remain neglected, Marilu emphasized.</p>\n<p>“That is a constant issue that we don’t know what to do with it. CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?” Austin replied.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“CalFresh pulls in a huge amount of resources into this campus, but again, because undocumented students are not eligible for that, what do we do?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>“Right now, the main things we have been pushing [are] what we do have on campus, which are the food pantries and free prepared meals.”</p>\n<p>Jack Greenberg, a third-year cultural anthropology major and employee at the I.V. Food Co-op, brought up the possibility of having a plot of land in the <a href=\"http://ucsbosl.orgsync.com/org/ghgp/home\">Greenhouse and Garden project</a> to serve the undocumented population.</p>\n<p>“One of my friends is looking to start an undocumented plot in the Greenhouse and Garden project … hopefully that will be a resource also where it can be already paid for and once it grows actual food can be [made available].”</p>\n<p>Those in attendance also expressed concern about CalFresh availability at on-campus convenience stores, stating that the Arbor remains the only on-campus institution to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsbs-arbor-now-accepting-calfresh/\">accept the program</a>.</p>\n<p>The lack of whole foods, particularly raw fruits and vegetables, at the Arbor was another point of concern with food availability for CalFresh recipients.</p>\n<p>Students also discussed the closure of the UC Global Food Initiative, which was intended as a short-term kickstart for campuses to address food security.</p>\n<p>“We still have to do that work; we want [those programs] to be funded — it’s not a given,” Austin noted.</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition is in the process of becoming a permanent standing committee under A.S. with support from A.S. Senators Anthony Hernandez, Rafael Cornejo, Gabriella Shofet and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/a-s-senator-karmes-wainer-petitions-for-hot-food-bar-on-campus/\">Sydney Karmes-Wainer</a>.</p>\n<p>“We accept everyone who wants to come, whether they’re on-campus organizations or off-campus organizations [and] as a standing committee under A.S., you get all the benefits of A.S. as well,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>Hernandez wants to work on increasing turnout for the meetings. He noted his concerns about having a low turnout of students since the meetings are scheduled for Fridays.</p>\n<p>“We thought about having a night market while we have the meeting since it’s Friday night and people are going to [Del Playa]… We want to build a culture around it, so that way people know about [Food for All].”</p>\n<p>The Food for All Coalition holds biweekly Friday meetings at Biko Garage from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>Caleb Brown is a reporter at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a65ee483b1f348796db93bdf9667fd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/calebbrown/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Caleb Brown</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Caleb Brown is a reporter for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-86227\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vargas discussed several topics, most notably the concept of “home.” <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Margaret Klawunn, the vice chancellor for UC Santa Barbara’s Student Affairs, spoke briefly before the lecture, explaining that its purpose was to zero in on the diversity of undocumented people not often represented in the media.</p>\n<p>Professor Lisa Sun-Hee Park, chair of the department of Asian-American Studies at UCSB, introduced Vargas by highlighting the significance of his lecture.</p>\n<p>“Almost thirty 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have made borders and walls essential fixture[s] of our national identity,” Park said.</p>\n<p>“It is an ineffectual shortcut and unimaginative copout from dealing with the realities of a global world.”</p>\n<p>Vargas’ appearance comes at a time when the nation approaches the possibility of another government shutdown over funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall.</p>\n<p>Vargas referenced this topic in his opening.</p>\n<p>“It’s really a privilege to be here tonight, considering the government may shut down again in the next couple of days, because we can’t seem to want to talk about immigration without talking about walls,” he said as he began his remarks to the crowd.</p>\n<p>The theme of the night’s lecture was “home.” Vargas used his allotted time to attempt to tease out the contradictions in how “home” is conceptualized as an undocumented immigrant.</p>\n<p>Vargas started the discussion by bringing up a seemingly trivial Bank of America email he received about his readiness to purchase a home.</p>\n<p>“I saw this email on my iPhone, and the subject line is, ‘Ready to buy a home?,’ and Trump had just gotten elected President,” he said. “At that point I heard from at least 30 undocumented people of all ages who are considering leaving the country.”</p>\n<p>Vargas said he had seriously considered leaving the United States for Canada, citing the prevalence of Filipinos in Toronto and the famous film festival named after the city.</p>\n<p>Then he received a letter from the chief of staff for Nancy Pelosi, current Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, inviting him to attend Trump’s first State of the Union as her guest.</p>\n<p>He spoke about his decision to publish an essay for the <i>Washington Post </i>jointly with his attendance, saying he felt it was risky considering Trump’s attitude toward immigrants, legal or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Vargas puts his contention to those opposed to his existence plainly, sharing the opening line of his previously published essay with the audience: “This is my country, too.”</p>\n<p>Vargas read aloud a passage from his essay explaining why he felt compelled to attend the State of the Union despite earlier considering relocating to Canada.</p>\n<p>“I decided to show up tonight [at the first State of the Union address] because that’s what immigrants, undocumented and documented, do: We show up. Despite the obvious risks and palpable fear we show up to work, to school, to church, to our communities, in big cities and rural towns.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86226\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86226\" data-attachment-id=\"86226\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/activist-jose-vargas-comes-to-campbell-hall-discusses-experiences-as-an-undocumented-immigrant/immigration_riley-esguerra_online-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1405&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Immigration_Riley Esguerra_ONLINE-9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=888%2C624&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86226\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=888%2C624\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=250%2C176&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Immigration_Riley-Esguerra_ONLINE-9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86226\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Vargas stressed the importance the immigration explosion presents historically, soberly noting the inability of “native-born” Americans to have this pressing conversation surrounding undocumented immigration.</p>\n<p>“This country can barely have a conversation about [the] Black Lives Matter Movement without having a panic attack. This country can’t even talk about Native Americans with any sort of nuance and any sort of import,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we’re going to expect that this country can talk about 43 million people? It’s not a surprise that we are where we are.”</p>\n<p>Around 30 minutes into his lecture, Vargas addressed the central, basic question regarding immigration, legal or not: “Why do people move?”</p>\n<p>Vargas delved into issues with U.S. foreign policy, particularly that of imperialism and colonialism, regarding his home nation of the Philippines. He referenced a conservative Tea Party event in North Carolina that he attended, where he said his response to a condescending question about Filipinos presence in the U.S. was, “Sir, <i>we are here</i> because <i>you were there</i>.”</p>\n<p>Vargas also called attention to the different ways that mass movements of people are framed.</p>\n<p>“Why is it that when white people move it’s called courageous, necessary … Manifest Destiny [and] White Man’s Burden. Yet when people of color move, what’s the question? Is it legal? Is it a crime? Will they assimilate? When will it stop?”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of his talk, Vargas revisited his recent book and the process behind it, detailing how the separation of the book into the themes of lying, passing and hiding came about.</p>\n<p>“My editor did something that was really horrific. She said, ‘I want you to go home for the holidays and I want you to list the Top 20 most painful experiences of your life,’” Vargas said.</p>\n<p>“I listed 22. When I broke them out everything had to do with either lying, passing and hiding.”</p>\n<p>For Vargas, filling out an employment form for the San Francisco Chronicle was an especially poignant moment. At the time, Vargas was not a lawful permanent resident nor did he agree with the categorization of himself as an “alien.”</p>\n<p>Marking himself as a citizen would constitute perjury, as a sentence on the application reminded him. Despite this, he checked himself off as a citizen.</p>\n<p>“There was nothing else to check so I checked citizen, and whenever I checked it I actually convinced myself I was gonna go earn [citizenship].</p>\n<p>Vargas was told later by a lawyer this past offense — a false claim to citizenship — may be the reason he never becomes a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p>Even worse, he said he was ‘hiding’ from his mother, not having seen her in 25 years.
