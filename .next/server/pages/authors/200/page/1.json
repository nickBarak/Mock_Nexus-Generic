Off-Campus Senator Alex Choate represented the Open People’s Party (OPP). The forum centered on issues ranging from how the future EVPSA would reach out to the UC Board of Regents to addressing the needs of undocumented students studying within the UC.</p>\n<p>In dealing with the UC Office of the President tax that was introduced last year, which requires all UC campuses to pay a 1.69 percent fee on all revenue-earning funding streams — including student-funded campus groups — Orozco said she was at the UCSA Congress when the UCOP initially introduced the fee.</p>\n<p>According to Orozco, the UCOP tax is an unjust financial strain on students, and as such, she said she will protest it by pressuring Chancellor Henry Yang to compile legislation in opposition to it.</p>\n<p>“I was there with the current UCSB President Sophia Armen when they were speaking to us about initiating the tax, and I was very vocally against it,” Orozco said. “After that, I was part of a group that organized rallies against it and put together an education campaign …[Student fees are] something we’ve decided to vote on and tax ourselves on. I will continue to actively voice against it.”</p>\n<p>However, Choate said the A.S. Senate has already passed a resolution calling for Chancellor Yang to stop the tax.</p>\n<p>“I sit on the student Senate, and we actually passed a resolution urging Chancellor Yang not to [tax],” Choate said. “And currently, as of right now, he has approved to not tax students once again this year…However, we have to work and look forward to next year and our future generations of students.”</p>\n<p>Following the EVPSA elections forum, the three candidates for the next A.S. President took the stage to debate issues ranging from topics of special projects on campus to broader subjects, like the interpretation of the top A.S. executive’s responsibilities.</p>\n<p>RHA President Jonathan Abboud debated as the OPP candidate, while Residential Advisor Megan Foronda spoke as the DP candidate and Patrick “Mac” Kennedy represented himself as an independent, non-partisan candidate.</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, the role of the A.S. president is to be an advocate of the students and to effectively communicate with UCSB administration. Abboud said he has three focal points that tackle all issues relevant to the A.S. presidency — University affairs, campus culture and the role of fiscally responsible management of A.S. funds.</p>\n<p>“First, strengthening higher education in California, we must unite together. Students, workers, faculty, staff and alumni must be united in our defense of higher education in California because students alone cannot win this fight,” Abboud said. “Second, campus culture is important to me. I think UCSB has a lacking campus culture, and A.S. should be instrumental in building new campus traditions…My last focal point is fiscal responsibility. You pay $180 every quarter into A.S. and you deserve to see every single dollar of that money. I want to take the leftover money and refund it back to you at the end of the year.”</p>\n<p>If elected as A.S. President, Foronda said she would work with both university administration as well as students, and said she plans to focus primarily on issues such as protesting UC tuition increases and assuring there is fair representation of all communities on campus.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to priorities, you must prioritize students first, especially in terms of higher education. When it comes to tuition hikes, students are out there advocating for themselves. I want to ensure that funding continues to go to student organizations that do work on this campus,” Foronda said. “When it comes to empowerment, I want to ensure that students themselves feel empowered in every space they are in. When we talk about campus climate, I want to make sure that marginalized communities feel safe on this campus and make sure that their voices are represented in these larger institutions.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy said he sees the role of A.S. President as someone who would unite the student body and reach out to students who are not members of A.S. Essentially, Kennedy said he is running on three main points — reducing tuition, ending A.S. corruption and improving campus climate.</p>\n<p>“I would make sure to reduce tuition. I’m the only candidate that has experience lobbying in Sacramento and that has developed relationships with key legislators,” Kennedy said. “I want to reform corruption in A.S. Currently, the five executives are using your student fees to pay for their own tuition — that’s corruption. That’s $4,500 and I’ll make sure that goes back to you. We could bring Kendrick Lamar here, J. Cole, Jack Johnson, anybody with that kind of money…I want to improve campus climate here. We need to get every single student involved somehow in this campus. We need to unify the gaucho experience.”</p>\n<p>Voting starts next week on GOLD, beginning on April 22 at 8 a.m. and ending at 4 p.m. on April 25.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"494842485\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50895\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/acclaimed-author-to-discuss-science-social-effects-of-malaria/forum-william-zhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Forum William Zhou\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50888\" alt=\"Forum William Zhou\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Forum-William-Zhou.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>WILLIAM ZHOU / DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A.S.

The IVP is the head of the A.S. Senate, the university’s student law-making body which holds weekly meetings that include distributing A.S. funds and other governmental affairs.</p>\n<p>Later in the afternoon, the debates for the position of EVPLA — which deals with issues primarily related to I.V. — took place. Candidates debated issues such as community-building, legal representation for I.V. residents and better safety efforts for large local events like Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>For the IVP debate, there was discussion of controversial A.S. topics like partisan lines that have sometimes existed in the Senate in past years, and the increasing number of senators resigning from the organization.</p>\n<p>Open People’s Party candidate and current A.S. senator Kyley Scarlet said fostering an inclusive environment requires that the A.S. Senate not become divided on party lines.</p>\n<p>“After we get elected in the spring, we are not from different parties … We are all on the same team, and therefore making the senators realize that we all ran together to make a change — to do something different on this campus — is essential,” Scarlet said.</p>\n<p>In dealing with the marginalized communities in Isla Vista and on campus, independent candidate for the IVP seat, Martin Polanco, said his personal experience as a potentially marginalized individual has not prevented him from integrating himself into the UCSB community.</p>\n<p>“Considering myself — as Latino, Hispanic or Mexican — I could be part of a marginalized community, but I feel that I’m not,” Polanco said. “I’m in a community, and I’m going to reach out to these other communities to find equal common ground so we can act together and make a difference.”</p>\n<p>As for reaching out to the general student body, Juan Galvan — Democratic Process Party candidate and current A.S. senator — said the association must be proactive in their recruitment efforts and attempts to make themselves more accessible to other students.</p>\n<p>“As IVP, as the leader of the association, I see it more as a facilitator,” Galvan said. “You have to really facilitate and work within, internally first, to create these coalitions among the different [Boards, Commissions and Committees] and create projects together — in order to be more open to the outside.”</p>\n<p>The two candidates vying for the spot of External Vice President of Local Affairs, Kaitlyn Christianson of the DP party and OPP’s Alexander Moore, spoke on a myriad of issues — such as keeping Isla Vista a tight-knit community and pushing for increased safety measures that would protect all residents.</p>\n<p>With last week’s Deltopia still fresh in the minds of students, candidates were asked how they would handle the growing issue of safety and crime in the community.</p>\n<p>Moore, who has worked in Isla Vista as a medical first responder during Halloween, said it is necessary to make law enforcement more accessible to students while also providing bystander intervention training to the community.</p>\n<p>Given the 23,000 residents living in I.V. and mere eight to 12 police officers patrolling the area, Christianson said it is necessary for the EVPLA and other campus entities — such as CSO officers — to better contribute to legal patrolling in I.V. Like Moore, Christianson also expressed the need to encourage bystander intervention in emergency situations.</p>\n<p>Since large-scale I.V. events are here to stay, the EVPLA Office must make efforts to educate the next generation of I.V. residents, Christianson said.</p>\n<p>“You have thousands of freshmen that are going to participate in these events, and their first glance is I.V. on a Friday night,” Christianson said. “I think the EVPLA office needs to go into the dorms and talk to them about these issues, representing I.V. in a positive light.”</p>\n<p>However, Moore’s solution to handling I.V.’s biggest parties is to reduce the amount of out-of-towners and to educate non-local police forces, who are oftentimes transferred into I.V. for these events, on students’ needs.</p>\n<p>“We need to be sure that out of town law enforcement that gets brought in to control these events is sensitive to students’ needs … A lot of times, LAPD and UCPD from other schools aren’t as sensitive to student needs and student rights as they should be. One of the things I really want to do is to make sure that those folks undergo training.”</p>\n<p>The debate also touched on better representing I.V. at the county level and keeping the community inclusive of all residents.</p>\n<p>According to Moore, I.V. has gone through a series of development projects — such as new residential buildings like The Loop — resulting in costly living conditions for students.</p>\n<p>“Those buildings can cost more than $1,000 per bed. I can’t afford those; I know our local community members can’t afford those, and neither can our permanent residents,” Moore said. “Gentrification is a problem in Isla Vista, and we need to manage it by re-evaluating the Isla Vista Master Plan … I really hope not to necessarily combat development, but to really improve on the plans set.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Christianson said the development of I.V. has taken advantage of student residents and local families alike.</p>\n<p>“Most of us have to live in I.V. — it’s close to campus, easy, accessible and we love I.V … Landlords know this and so they take advantage of these students and raise prices,” Christianson said. “There was an eviction of these families on Embarcadero del Mar this year, where they essentially told the families to get out because they were going to remodel and the families didn’t know they were being kicked out so they can raise prices.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the April 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50792\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50792\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/senate-candidates-debate-party-lines-local-event-safety/","id":3091,"author":{"id":200,"name":"Arda Jooharian"},"related":[3090,3089,3088],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/200"}},"__N_SSG":true}
