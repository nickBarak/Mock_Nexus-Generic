But when IU forward Griffin Dorsey chose to try and dribble out of the box instead of clearing the ball away, a Stanford attacker stole it and shot it just over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Trey Muse.</p>\n<p>Before they knew it, the season was over.</p>\n<p>It was a season that saw IU finish 18-1-6 and put together the fourth-longest shutout streak in NCAA history at 966:28 minutes. Just two key players left that team, and now 10 of IU’s 11 starters return in hopes of avenging that cold Sunday in Philadelphia on Dec. 10, 2017.</p>\n<p>From offense to defense this Hoosier team is filled with talent and built for success. There is no weak link on this team.</p>\n<p>Starting in the net, the sophomore goalkeeper has 30 shutouts in his two seasons at IU. Just last week, Muse made an incredible diving save to prevent Notre Dame from taking the lead 1-0 in the quarterfinals. Then there are IU’s two rocks in the backline in redshirt senior Timmy Mehl and freshman Jack Maher, who rarely let anyone sneak by them. The two outside backs are seniors Rece Buckmaster and Andrew Gutman. Both are quick and versatile in becoming offensively minded when the time is right. Gutman leads the team in goals with 11.</p>\n<p>Mix that in with the controlling midfielders that are redshirt senior Francesco Moore, senior Jeremiah Gutjahr, redshirt senior Trevor Swartz, redshirt sophomore Spencer Glass and redshirt senior Cory Thomas, who can all shift back when Buckmaster or Gutman push up, and you get a team that controls possession and allows very few chances.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the forwards — Dorsey, sophomore Justin Rennicks, senior Austin Panchot and redshirt sophomore A.J. Palazzolo. Panchot scored the game-winning goal against Notre Dame last week off a header from Gutman’s cross. Palazzolo is a big body that is dangerous on set pieces while Rennicks and Dorsey have the speed and talent to take any defender one-on-one.</p>\n<p>The makeup of this team is dangerous, and that’s why the Hoosiers are 20-2-1 this season. The last time the team lost was Oct. 3 against Kentucky, which was an uncharacteristic 3-0 defeat. In the 63 days since then, which has included 12 games, IU has only given up three goals.</p>\n<p>Also, since that loss, IU has scored 22 goals and been crowned Big Ten Champions — becoming the only team in conference history to go an undefeated 8-0 — and Big Ten Tournament Champions.</p>\n<p>Everything is coming together right now for the Hoosiers, and they are playing their best soccer.</p>\n<p>“We’re locked in as much as we’ve ever been,” Yeagley said on Tuesday before the team left for Santa Barbara, Calif. “That’s what you want: You want the team to find another gear in every phase of their game. I think we’re in that mode right now where everyone is locked in.”</p>\n<p>The redemption of this season wasn’t supposed to be beating Stanford. No, the redemption was to claim what the Hoosiers believe is rightfully theirs: the National Championship.</p>\n<p>Four teams and two games stand in IU’s way of accomplishing that goal. Akron, Michigan State, and Maryland are all deserving of spots in the College Cup, but there’s only one team who is so driven, so talented and so deserving of winning on Dec. 9, and that team hails from Bloomington, Indiana.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever, redemption is within grasp of claiming the program’s ninth National Championship.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 14\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div id=\"attachment_85316\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"472085731\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85313\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85316\" data-attachment-id=\"85316\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/collaboration-with-the-competition-student-journalists-weigh-in-on-college-cup-teams/v46r5uqjwzed5m3gd7ybuz2ude/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?fit=1875%2C1250&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1875,1250\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-85316\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?w=1875&amp;ssl=1 1875w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/V46R5UQJWZED5M3GD7YBUZ2UDE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forward Vinicius Lansade celebrates after scoring his first career goal during Maryland’s 3-2 overtime win over Penn State at Ludwig Field on Oct. 23, 2018.<em> (Richard Moglen/The Diamondback)</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>Terps Look To Finish The Season Strong With A Title</strong><br>\n<strong>Joe Catapano, <em>The Diamondback</em></strong></p>\n<p>Throw out the standings, the seedings, and the statistics. Forget that Maryland didn’t score for the first 476 minutes of the year, didn’t win until its fifth match and didn’t have a record that would even qualify for the NCAA tournament 12 games into the regular season.</p>\n<p>No. 11 seed Maryland’s campaign can be summarized using the cliché adage: “It’s not how you start. It’s how you finish.” And the Terps show no signs of ceasing their magical postseason — one that’s featured two road upsets without conceding a goal in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Sasho Cirovski’s Terps are just as capable of winning the national championship as any of the other College Cup participants. Despite a semifinals matchup against a team they haven’t beaten both times they’ve tried this year, the Terps’ season took a dramatic turn with a loss on Oct. 12 to Indiana.</p>\n<p>Maryland is 7-1-1 since falling to the Hoosiers with 18 seconds remaining in Bloomington. The impressive record is thanks to Andrew Gutman, who Cirovski continuously boasts is the best player in college soccer.</p>\n<p>Even after two convincing 2-0 performances over former ACC foes in NC State and No. 6 Duke, it was hard to see Maryland upsetting No. 3 Kentucky in the quarterfinals. The Wildcats hadn’t trailed, lost or been shut out at home all season.</p>\n<p>Maryland scored in the 29th minute and then held on for another 61 to accomplish all three feats. So now’s the time to refer back to my opening sentence: Through all the adversity this season, the Terps’ confidence has never wavered. They’re not surprised they’re playing in Santa Barbara, and understandably so.</p>\n<p>They knew going into the season that the offense would take time to develop after losing three of their top four goalscorers from 2017. Maryland has now scored in 10 straight games and has scored on its first shot on goal in all three tournament games.</p>\n<p>They knew they would become tougher playing through what’s now the No. 1 toughest schedule in the nation. Maryland only had two ranked wins in the regular season, but they now have three since the Big Ten tournament began.</p>\n<p>They knew they had a senior class that lost in the NCAA quarterfinals as freshmen, only to see first-round exits in the next two years. Maryland has now redeemed itself, but those seniors didn’t come to College Park to reach a College Cup — they came to win one.</p>\n<p>The means of doing so starts with the backline. It’s rare for a Maryland team, but its foundation is defense. Junior defenders Donovan Pines and Johannes Bergmann are an elite center back duo, complemented by outside backs senior Chase Gasper and sophomore Ben Di Rosa.</p>\n<p>If that stout four-man unit breaks down, goalkeeper redshirt junio Dayne St. Claire will make every save he’s supposed to and most ones he shouldn’t be expected to. The Terps switched to a two-center defensive midfielder formation midway through the year, which essentially adds senior Andrew Samuels and junior Eli Crognale as reinforcements to an already-impenetrable defense.</p>\n<p>Senior Amar Sejdic pushed forward as a center attacking midfielder, where he’s thrived for a team-leading seven goals this season. The three forwards up top have done enough to keep winning. Freshman William James Herve has the dribbling skills, junior Paul Bin has the speed and senior Sebastian Elney has the clutch gene.</p>\n<p>Let this serve as the final warning. Cirovski has called this season a redemption story, and with two previous heartbreaks against Indiana this year, the Hoosiers might be the penultimate victim in the Terps’ title tale.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"attachment_85315\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"863840015\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"85313\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85315\" data-attachment-id=\"85315\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/collaboration-with-the-competition-student-journalists-weigh-in-on-college-cup-teams/soccer-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?fit=1000%2C664&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,664\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"soccer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?fit=888%2C590&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85315\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?resize=888%2C590\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/soccer.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-85315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Annie Barker / The State News</em></p></div>\n<p><strong>After five seasons of defeat, this is MSU’s moment</strong><br>\n<strong>Kara Keating, <em>The State News</em></strong></p>\n<p>When thinking about Michigan State athletics, the first thing that comes to mind is often the football team or the men’s basketball team. For other fans, they tend to point out the men’s soccer team, especially after they posted 14-4-4 in the regular season are beginning to be known as a powerhouse.</p>\n<p>For the first time in 50 years, the Spartans are making their appearance in the Final Four after losing players to injury, going through scoring droughts and being eliminated in the Elite Eight four times in the past five seasons. This is their chance to earn the victory they have been dreaming of. With Head Coach Damon Rensing at the helm since 2009, the team has a 2018 NCAA Tournament record of 11-5-3.</p>\n<p>The team has been named co-champions twice — once back in 1967 and again in 1968 — but this is their moment to shine and win it all as independent champions.</p>\n<p>The Spartans would defeat some of the top teams in the Big Ten Conference and in the nation, but it was merely talked about while being shadowed by the 7-5 football team and other major news surrounding the campus. Before the start of the season, MSU fans would support the soccer team and head to the free games on campus, but they never truly got the buzz that they are getting now from Spartan fans and the student section known as the Red Cedar Rowdies.</p>\n<p>After beating James Madison University last Saturday, the team is now seeing what impact they have made. While leaving a restaurant in town after a team meal, people began applauding, which is something the players have never experienced before.</p>\n<p>“That just hit home on just how much of an effect this team has had,” Rensing said.</p>\n<p>Not only do the fans in East Lansing want another National Championship for their town, but so do these players. Senior forward Ryan Sierakowski and his senior classmates made this their goal starting their freshmen year and are determined to make it there.</p>\n<p>This season Sierakowski is close to becoming the first Spartan player to lead the team in points in his four seasons in the green and white uniform, and he is ranked No. 10 all-time in scoring, putting up 82 points in 81 games.</p>\n<p>The offense isn’t the only ones hitting the back of the net, though. Three MSU defenders have scored a total of five goals together throughout the season: redshirt sophomore Patrick Nielsen, junior Michael Wetungu and senior John Freitag.</p>\n<p>Another strong advantage for this tournament is the familiar faces that they will come to play against in the tournament. To start the Final Four off, they will take on Akron for the second time this season after losing to the Zips 2-1, but they feel ready to compete after regaining players back from injuries.</p>\n<p>“We don’t have to watch film,” Rensing said. “We know Akron, and they know us … You’d rather dance with the devil you know than the one you don’t know.”</p>\n<p>Going from multiple NCAA tournament runs and constant letdowns before making it to the Final Four, this team has come together for not only the fans but also for their former teammates to earn them the title that they know they deserve.</p>\n<p>Whether they become National Champions or lose to Akron on Friday night, Michigan State will become a little more focused on what the soccer team will bring for years to come.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the</em> <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB women’s soccer team triumphed in a dramatic late win on Thursday evening, as junior midfielder Lynsee Voss rifled in two goals in the 63rd and 71st minutes to vault Santa Barbara over Cal State Northridge with a 2-1 victory.</p>\n<p>“It’s a massive relief to know that we’re in the Big West Tournament,” gleamed Coach Paul Stumpf while letting out a sigh of relief. “If we win on Sunday, we win the title outright; you can hear them in the locker room, they’re obviously celebrating, but it’s not done yet. They’ll recover their bodies, get their minds right, and hopefully put on another big performance on Sunday.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos (12-6, 5-2 Big West) leapt into a first-place tie with UC Irvine as each team has garnered a hearty 15 points this season. The Matadors (6-8-1, 2-5 Big West) remained in the eighth spot following the tough loss to a streaking Santa Barbara squad.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Both teams clamped down on the defensive end in the first half of play as there were only a combined three shots fired off before the break. Freshman keeper Amanda Delgado leapt to make two crucial saves in the 17th and 19th minutes which kept score knotted up at zero a piece.</p>\n<p>In the 51st minute, the Matadors’ fed a streaking Alexis White who entered the box and took a chance at goal as she fired toward the near post across her body. Gaucho junior Hannah DeWeese laid out to make a diving save, but White finessed a quick touch to CSUN forward Bethany Fitzsimmons who weaseled past a shot to take a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>White had another chance at goal a mere 3 minutes later, but DeWeese once again made a critical stop to keep the game tight. The Gauchos maintained control over the next 10 minutes and managed to get solid shots at goal but couldn’t convert.</p>\n<p>In minute 63, freshman forward Jessica Wright sent a cross into the box that was deflected by a CSUN defender and directed to Lynsee Voss. Voss powered a screamer past a diving Delgado as UCSB tied up the match at 1-1.</p>\n<p>“Technically speaking on a surface like this, that’s difficult,” emphasized Stumpf in his twentieth season. “It was a half-volley which is very difficult to keep low; a surface like this, it speeds up and it’s slick. She tucked it nicely away in the corner to even it up so that we could get after them for the next one.”</p>\n<p>Just minutes later, Big West assist leader senior Mallory Hromatko delivered a switch to Voss who found space and crept a go-ahead goal past the misplaced Delgado to take a 2-1 lead in the 71st minute. This marked the midfielder’s third goal of the season and second game winner this year.</p>\n<p>Late game heroics have been a common occurrence for the Gauchos this season as 20 out of 30 (67%) total goals this year have come in the second half of games. In each of the Gaucho’s most recent three wins, the team has come alive in the second half to score a game-winning goal in the 70th minute or later.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a chance to clinch the first-place spot on Sunday evening with a victory over seventh place Cal Poly (2-12-4, 2-4-1 Big West). Irvine played its final game of the season on Thursday and is in danger of falling into the third spot with wins from Santa Barbara and Long Beach State over the weekend.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos play their season finale on the road Sunday against the Cal Poly Mustangs for another chapter of the Blue-Green Rivalry.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84607\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/lynsee-voss-strikes-with-two-late-goals-to-secure-the-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84607\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/lynsee-voss-strikes-with-two-late-goals-to-secure-the-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/lynsee-voss-strikes-with-two-late-goals-to-secure-the-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/lynsee-voss-strikes-with-two-late-goals-to-secure-the-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/lynsee-voss-strikes-with-two-late-goals-to-secure-the-win/","id":1342,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[1341,1340,1339],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Wins Two Out of Three This Past Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-03-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-13-at-10.14.17-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-13-at-10.14.17-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos find their way back to .500 on the season after a 2-1 weekend record helped them get back into a better groove.

You’re going to be surrounded by a ridiculous amount of the most beautiful people you’ve ever met, inside and out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It might be tough for you to leave everything you’ve ever known behind – your family and friends, the familiar streets you learned to drive on, your favorite restaurants, your dog – it’s not easy.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But what you get in return: the ultimate fresh start.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Forget the ex who cheated on you, the bullies, the dumbasses, the people you’ve been going to school with since kindergarten that still don’t even know your name. Here in SB, we’re all in this together.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Right now, you have the power to control where your life goes. You can go down any path, and many times, you’re going to regret your decisions… Many, many, many times, actually.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">But no matter what mistakes you make, never let a bad experience keep you down; learn from it, grow, and do whatever you can to make it a positive influence on your life moving forward.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If there’s one piece of advice I can emphasize more than anything, it is this: always have an open mind. No matter what you’ve thought about something in the past, at the very least, ask yourself “Why?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Why is Friends the greatest show ever? Why am I a Democrat instead of Republican? Why am I against drinking or doing drugs? Why do I believe in God?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Never be afraid of the answers to life’s hardest questions. This is the time for you to learn who you are and what your position is on important issues. As Aristotle once said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">At the end of the day, college is only going to be what you make of it.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Okay, now that I’ve imparted some life-changing wisdom that you’ll remember for the rest of your life, it’s time to talk about sports. You may not have seen too much of UCSB on ESPN or anything, but our teams do in fact kick ass.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For example, last season, our men’s volleyball, men’s water polo and baseball teams were ranked as high as No. 3, No. 5 and No. 6 in the nation, respectively.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">I’m sure you’ve also heard about our men’s soccer team, which has finished with the No. 1 seed in the Big West in each of the last two seasons.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If you’re going to make it to any one game this season, make sure it’s men’s soccer against Cal Poly. When we hosted them last year, it was in front of the second-largest crowd in NCAA history. And if the image of tortillas flying recklessly through the air in all directions excites you, then you’ll be happy to hear that that’s how we celebrate goals. Make sure you cover your head, though.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now, if you want to get in on the sports action yourself, then you’re also in luck. We have an excellent intramural community that gives you fun, organized competition for a large variety of sports and talent levels. You’ll sometimes even have the chance to play with UCSB athletes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For those of you that want to get behind the scenes, interviewing future professional athletes, writing articles about the sports you love and seeing what it’s like to be a journalist, then feel free to either e-mail us or come by the Nexus office and meet either myself or our assistant sports editor, Sean White.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">So, with that being said, take a look down below and begin your tour of the teams you’ll be rooting for in the near future.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wishing you a fantastic and successful time here at UCSB,</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Michael J</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Gauchos Do It Better</strong> – Sean White</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Thank you summer for the fun, but it’s time to get back to the grind. Welcome back to all the returning students, and greetings to the new class of freshmen. I hope all of you are ready to embark on your new journey as Gauchos!</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My name is Sean White (yes… almost like the snow/skate boarder) and I am entering my second-year as a Pre-Communication major. This is my second year as a writer and first-year as an editor for the Daily Nexus. I am looking forward to providing UCSB with the best content and coverage of its sports.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It’s crazy that I was just in your position preparing for my first year of college. Trust me, it goes by fast so make sure you enjoy every second of being a Gaucho.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My one suggestion for having a successful school year is simply making sure that you attend as many sporting events as possible. It’s the best way to overcome the stresses of school and take a break from the party scene. When you have teams that are talented and entertaining like UCSB does, it makes college more enjoyable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There’s no one sport at UCSB that I can tell you to commit to because they all have so much to offer. You’ve probably heard that UCSB is only a soccer powerhouse, but don’t let that deceive you. Our school may not receive much attention in mainstream sports headlines, but the experiences and memories gained from any UCSB sporting event are incomparable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While rankings and statistics help measure a team’s capability, it’s the atmosphere and energy of being in the Thunderdome, Harder Stadium, or any other UCSB venue that makes each moment meaningful. Since coming to UCSB, it has been the experience factor that has increased my interest in sports that I did not have much knowledge about.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As an only child, I guess you could call sports that brother or sister that I never had. I was once that kid with dreams of going to the NFL. Although UCSB does not have a football team, attending this school has made me realize how diverse sports are.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Writing for the Nexus has been everything that I hoped to do in my pursuit of a career within sports media and is responsible for my interest in learning more about sports such as volleyball, water polo, soccer, golf, and more. Even if you attend just one game, I hope that at the end of the school year you all can reminisce on the great times you had while cheering for our Gauchos.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">With that being said, I hope all of you have a wonderful year. Be sure to follow us on Twitter for everything UCSB sports related: @thenexus_sports.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Thank you,</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Sean</p>\n<div

Heaven” returns to Harder Stadium this Saturday as the UCSB men’s soccer team plays its opening exhibition game against Westmont, giving both the team and the fans a first look at the newly reinforced Gaucho side.</p>\n<p>“The key for the Westmont game is, number one, you want to win the game. But you also want to have your first players do the things that you’ve been working on in training,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “It’s also the only game that you can play your younger players and get them an opportunity to see how everything feels out on the field. You hope you can do all of that in one game.”</p>\n<p>The annual season-opening matchup, which has historically been dominated by UCSB, is the Gauchos’ only tune-up game before a hosting a difficult early-season challenge against Stanford next Friday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“All the teams that have done well in the past at UCSB have gone out in this Westmont game and have won by six or seven goals, so obviously we’re looking to send a message in this game to our future opponents,” senior defender Duncan Backus said. “We’re just looking to do all the right things on the field so we can get a good result and send a message to the rest of the country that we’re here to play this year.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off its second straight successful campaign in 2014 in which it finished the regular season with a record of 10-7-3 overall and 6-2-2 in conference, good enough to secure a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the Big West Tournament. Unfortunately, for the second straight year, the Gauchos fell by a final score of 3-2 in the Big West Tournament Semifinals, this time in a heartbreaker to UC Irvine, ending their hopes of making a run in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Ready to put last year behind them, the Gauchos are looking at this weekend as a welcome fresh start.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the last couple years, to be frank, it wasn’t good enough. What’s expected at UCSB is a lot better than what we’ve shown.” Backus said. “We’re looking to put this program back to where it needs to be and that’s at the top of the country. Everyone’s taken great pride in the shirt and as long as we sustain that excitement, with the level of talent that we have here, I don’t see a lot of teams being able to compete with us.”</p>\n<p>A big factor playing in UCSB’s favor this year will be the experience of its core group. Last year, the Gauchos saw a high number of underclassmen taking up a large share of the minutes on the field. While it may not have been an ideal situation at the time, the benefits from having key players receive all that play time should be clear once the season begins.</p>\n<p>“The last two years we’ve played a lot of young players, so now we see the benefit of seeing guys who have played 55-60 college games,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ll certainly know more about ourselves on Saturday but I like where we are right now and I like the attitude that we have on this team.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps the three most crucial of the “young players” from the last two seasons are now juniors in forward Nick DePuy, left back Ismaila Jome and midfielder Drew Murphy. DePuy made the move to forward last season and led the team with 10 goals, including six game-winners, making national headlines and earning himself the Big West Offensive Player of the Year award.</p>\n<p>Jome and Murphy both shared the team lead with five assists apiece, helping earn them a spot alongside DePuy on this year’s Preseason All-Conference Team. UCSB also received seven out of eight first-place votes in the preseason coaches poll to win the Big West North Division for the third straight year.</p>\n<p>“We’re in good shape in terms of having options,” Vom Steeg said. “Nick will be a center point of our attack, but unlike last year where if he scored we usually won and if he didn’t score we usually didn’t win, we’re going to have lots of different scoring options.”</p>\n<p>Another issue which plagued Santa Barbara all last season was the impact of injuries on the team’s depth, particularly in the midfield. Halfway through the conference season, Vom Steeg was even forced to put sophomore midfielder Andy Perez, who had been redshirting the entire season, into the starting lineup.</p>\n<p>However, luck has been on the Gauchos’ side thus far in the preseason in terms of their health.</p>\n<p>“I think the question mark is going to be what we do out of midfield. I think we have some flexibility,” Vom Steeg said. “Coming out of training camp we have one injury, so we have 28 players available. We’re in good shape.”</p>\n<p>UCSB kicks off the season with its annual exhibition against Westmont at 7:00 p.m. this Saturday at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-21/soccer-heaven-returns-to-harder-stadium/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-21/soccer-heaven-returns-to-harder-stadium/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-21/soccer-heaven-returns-to-harder-stadium/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-21/soccer-heaven-returns-to-harder-stadium/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-08-21/soccer-heaven-returns-to-harder-stadium/","id":1520,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[1519,1518,1517],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Tennis Plays UNLV in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos look to get back even at .500","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1609013439\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"60327\"><img data-attachment-id=\"34031\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-25/ucsb-takes-aim-mustangs/womenstennis/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg?fit=2535%2C2114&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2535,2114\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D300\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1297431241\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"145\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.002\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"women’stennis!\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg?fit=250%2C208&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg?fit=888%2C741&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-34031\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg?resize=888%2C741\" alt=\"women'stennis!\" width=\"888\" height=\"741\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg?w=2535&amp;ssl=1 2535w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg?resize=250%2C208&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg?resize=1024%2C854&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg?resize=120%2C100&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/womenstennis.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><br>\n</a></p>\n<p>Playing in its first home game of the season, the UCSB women’s tennis team will take on the University of Nevada Las Vegas on Saturday morning.

Some teams have surprised us, like the Portland Trailblazers; other teams that looked promising have turned out to be massive failures, such as the two teams in New York. One of the biggest stories this season is the domination of the Western Conference over the East. Only four teams in the East are over .500 compared to eight in the West. With the exception of Indiana and Miami, there has been no competition when teams from the two sides have gone head-to-head. So, it’s time to take a look at the teams in the West. While the West has dominated over the East, there are some teams have overall have done really well and some that haven’t. At the halfway point, here’s a grade breakdown for each team in the more successful West.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oklahoma City Thunder, A-</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>OKC is once again looking like a team that could contend for an NBA championship. Kevin Durant is making a strong case for MVP once again, leading the NBA in points with 29.2 points per game. He is also shooting 49.7 percent from the field and 42.2 percent from three point range. His partner in crime on offense, Russell Westbrook, was having one of his best NBA seasons until he suffered another injury, but he will be back this season. Westbrook was giving the Thunder a phenomenal 21.3 points and 7.0 assists per game. If he can return to full health, OKC will be playing late into the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>San Antonio Spurs, A</p>\n<p>The team that was seconds away from another NBA championship last season is at it again. The Big Three in San Antonio in Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili continue to get older and yet still continue to be great. They lead the Spurs offensively, averaging 14.2, 17.7 and 12.6 points, respectively. The success for the Spurs, however, still comes on the defensive end. San Antonio doesn’t allow opponents to find an offensive groove and continues to rank among the best in scoring defense. Most didn’t think San Antonio would compete with Miami last season, but this team of veterans doesn’t like to lose. They will always be around.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Portland Trailblazers, A+</p>\n<p>One of the biggest surprises in the NBA this season has been Portland. A team that was at one point topping the West, the Blazers are the top scoring team in the NBA, averaging 108.7 points per game. The scoring starts with LaMarcus Aldridge, who is averaging an incredible 23.3 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. Complementing Aldridge’s inside game is point guard Damian Lillard, who adds 21.3 points and 5.8 assists per game. Combined with Wesley Matthews on the perimeter, all-around player Nicolas Batum, and Robin Lopez, who is exceeding expectations, Portland finally has a team that is coming together.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>L.A. Clippers, B</p>\n<p>The Clippers are right where they’re supposed to be, atop the Pacific Division. While the defense needs to improve, Chris Paul continues to show why he’s the best point guard in the NBA, averaging 19.6 points and a league-leading 11.2 assists per game. However, Paul is now out for three to five weeks with a shoulder injury and without its glue, L.A. must show it can still win games. Blake Griffin, who is currently averaging a team-high 22 points per game, will be critical. L.A. has plenty of role players on this team, so if they can play well, the Clippers should be able to manage until Paul’s return.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Houston Rockets, B</p>\n<p>Houston has dealt with inconsistency this season, losing to bad teams like Utah and Sacramento. Yet, the Rockets could be a great team going further into the season. Of course, the Rockets should be winning games with two of the best players in the game. James Harden is having another fantastic year, having his way with opponents’ defense, averaging 24.4 points per game. In the middle, Dwight Howard has returned to more of the dominant center fans know. Howard is giving the Rockets 17.8 points, 12.9 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game. Along with Chandler Parsons and Jeremy Lin this is a team with plenty of firepower.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Golden State Warriors, B+</p>\n<p>The Warriors aren’t atop the Western Conference right now, but they’re always dangerous and have won eight straight games. They’ve dealt with small injuries along the way to Stephan Curry and Andre Iguodala, but scoring will never be a problem on this team, which features the most dangerous backcourt in the game right now. Curry is averaging 23.3 points per game while Klay Thompson is tallying 19.3 points per contest. David Lee has stepped up too, giving the Warriors 18.9 points per game. Defensively, Golden State has Iguodala and Andrew Bogut to keep opponents in check, so if healthy, they could go far this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Phoenix Suns, A</p>\n<p>Nobody thought Phoenix would be a playoff team. Most, including myself, thought the Suns would be a cellar dweller in the West. We were all wrong. Currently in the seventh seed, Phoenix is in the top 10 in the NBA in scoring, putting up 103.7 points per game. The reason for that can be found in Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. Bledsoe, the understudy of Chris Paul last season, has spread his wings, averaging 18.0 points and 5.8 assists. Dragic is averaging slightly better numbers, tallying 18.8 points and 5.9 assists. The pair of guards has made Phoenix a playoff team and a huge surprise this season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dallas Mavericks, B</p>\n<p>When your team has Dirk Nowitzki, you always have a good chance of making the playoffs. The veteran forward is not showing signs of age by any means, putting up 21.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game. He’s shooting 48.8 percent from the field, 40.8 percent from behind the arc and 92.0 percent from the free throw line. With Monta Ellis also making a big impact, averaging 20.2 points per game, there isn’t one player defenses can focus on. Defense might not be this team’s strength, but Nowitzki is a veteran player, making Dallas a team nobody can overlook.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Timberwolves, B-</p>\n<p>Kevin Love has been a monster on the court this year. Averaging 26.4 points (second-best in the NBA) and 13.5 rebounds per game, Love has been consistent, putting numbers on the board night in and night out. Kevin Martin and Nikola Pekovic also keep the defense busy, tallying 19.8 and 18.0 points per game, respectively. So the offense is strong in Minnesota. The problem keeping the T-Wolves out of the playoff picture? Defense. The team gives up 102.9 points per game, fourth-highest in the NBA. Yet, the Timberwolves are currently just one spot out of the playoffs, so this is a team not to give up on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Denver Nuggets, C+</p>\n<p>There’s one name to know in Denver: Ty Lawson. With Andre Iguodala gone, Lawson knows this is officially his team, and has put up the numbers to prove it, averaging 17.7 points and 8.1 assists per game. His teammates have matched his energy and the team has plenty of threats from behind the arc. Nevertheless, I don’t see this as a team that makes the playoffs. They simply don’t play good enough defense to be a top-eight contender.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New Orleans Pelicans, B-</p>\n<p>Ryan Anderson has stepped up big for New Orleans this season. The power forward continues to spread the opponents’ defense, shooting 40.9 percent from three-point range. Overall, he’s averaging an impressive 19.8 points per game. The problem for the Pelicans is that last week, Anderson went down with a neck injury and is still undergoing tests in Boston. The Pelicans do have Anthony Davis, Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans, all of which are capable of putting up big numbers, but without Anderson, this team will struggle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Memphis Grizzlies, C-</p>\n<p>It seems like the Grizzlies have always been known for their defense. And they still are, holding opponents to 97.5 points per game. Defense will win a lot of ball games, but to win, you also have to be able to score points. Mike Conley has found his stride on the offensive end, giving the Grizzlies a solid 17.3 points per game. Zach Randolph has also done his job for Memphis this season, leading the team with 17.1 points per game. Yet, the Grizzlies are still on the bottom end of the NBA in scoring. This may change when Marc Gasol returns, but the Grizzlies need to find an answer now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>L.A. Lakers, B+</p>\n<p>The Lakers have to be wondering how they could receive so much bad luck in one season. Many teams have suffered injuries, but none as many as L.A. First, superstar Kobe Bryant returned from his torn Achilles tendon. Six games later, he injured his knee and will be out for extended time. Steve Nash has also only played in six games. He is one of a handful of point guards the Lakers have gone through. L.A. has gone deep into its D-League team with the only recognizable name left on the Lakers being Pau Gasol. With so much uncertainty and so many roster changes, Head Coach Mike D’Antoni requires a lot of credit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Sacramento Kings, D</p>\n<p>In a rebuilding year, star DeMarcus Cousins has proved himself a premier center in the NBA, averaging 23.2 points and 11.4 rebounds, but Cousins still has a lot of maturing to do as he currently leads the league in technicals. Isaiah Thomas has also stepped up, adding 19.3 points and 6.2 assists per contest. The recently acquired Rudy Gay has been great thus far, putting up 19.5 points per game. But offense isn’t the problem. Despite Head Coach Michael Malone preaching defense, Sacramento still gives up 104.5 points to its opponent, second-worst in the NBA. The formula for improvement is pretty simple: play defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Utah Jazz, D+</p>\n<p>Compared to most NBA teams, Utah doesn’t have much talent, lacking a huge NBA star. Therefore, the team wasn’t expected to win big. Nevertheless, with the worst record in the West, it’s not possible to give this team a passing grade. In what was supposed to be a developmental year for the Jazz, Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors have been decent for the Jazz, averaging 16.5 and 13.5 points per game, respectively, but the Jazz need more from Trey Burke. The highly-anticipated rookie that slipped to the ninth pick in the draft has struggled with consistency despite averaging 13.3 points and 5.2 assists. Right now, the Jazz would have a good shot in the lottery, which looks to have several franchise-changing players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53394\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53394\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/nothing-but-the-best-out-west/","id":3246,"author":{"id":80,"name":"Sports Editor"},"related":[3245,3244,3243],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 5 Gauchos Set to Take on No. 1 USC in Pivotal MPSF Matchup","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 5 UCSB men’s water polo team travels to undefeated No. 1 USC this weekend for its fifth Mountain Pacific Sports Federation game of the season. “We have changed up the practice structure a ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 5 UCSB men’s water polo team travels to undefeated No. 1 USC this weekend for its fifth Mountain Pacific Sports Federation game of the season.</p>\n<p>“We have changed up the practice structure a little bit and we have done a little more to prepare for this game,” junior guard Dylan Baliani said. “USC is undefeated at the moment, but if we play well this weekend we can beat them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is coming off a tough 11-7 loss to Pepperdine last Saturday, which brought their record to 1-3 in MPSF play and 15-6 overall.

The Gauchos will finish their game with Hawaii late Thursday night and head back to the mainland for the second game of their road trip.</p>\n<p>Cal State Northridge currently ranks third in the Big West standings with a 7-5 conference and 16-8 overall record. The Matadors last defeated Long Beach State in five sets Saturday night in a game where three players recorded double digit kills. Sophomore middle blocker Casey Hinger led the Northridge attack with 17 kills, tying her season high. Hinger is second in the Big West averaging 1.23 blocks per set. Junior setter Sydney Gedryn, who is seventh at a 1.13 blocks per set, helps lead the Matadors as the top blocking team in the conference.</p>\n<p>The second place Gauchos will need a big win to maintain their position this weekend. At 13-12 and 6-4 in the Big West, UCSB needs another strong outing against the Matadors. The last time these two teams met, Santa Barbara swept CSUN in three sets.

He is the most athletic specimen the game has ever seen. At 6’ 8” and 270 pounds, he has the most unique blend of size, strength, speed, instincts and jaw-dropping athleticism to ever grace the court. His ability to play and guard 1 through 4 while demonstrating more consistent defensive intensity than Kobe also makes him much more versatile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>LeBron, at just 26 years of age, has played seven fewer seasons and roughly one-third the numbers of playoff games as Kobe. This is important to consider simply because he has had far less opportunities to make big shots, or shine in “clutch” situations as Kobe is so over-glorified for.</p>\n<p>Moreover, using the NBA’s measure of clutch play — the final five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime with a margin of five points or fewer — LeBron has again proved to be far more efficient than the Black Mamba in each of the last four seasons. Believe it or not, when Kobe is on the floor in crunch time, his Lakers are actually outscored by their opponents.</p>\n<p>In fact, LeBron has actually performed better than Kobe at the end of tight playoff games. Over the course of Kobe’s playoff career, he has connected on five of 20 attempts when having the opportunity to make a potential game-tying or go-ahead field goal in the final 10 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime, (or 25 percent compared to the league average over the same time of 28 percent). Conversely, LBJ has made five of 12 of these same shots during his playoff career (41.7 percent).</p>\n<p>When the two have met head to head, it is yet another landslide victory for King James. James-led teams are 9-5 when meeting with Kobe’s, while playing most of those games on teams with far inferior talent. Bryant has also benefited from playing for the most decorated coach in NBA history. During that infamous 2004-05 season, with Coach Phil Jackson on vacation and Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins as his sidekicks, Kobe led his team to a miserable 34-48 record and an 11th place finish in the Western Conference.</p>\n<p>James, on a team with comparable talent in 2009, led Mo Williams, Zydrunas Ilgauskas and co. to 66 wins. Also intriguing, this season the Cavs, with a vast majority of their roster still intact, stumbled to a pathetic 19-63 record in their first year without King James — finishing dead last in the Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Hate him or love him, LeBron is the most dominant player in the game today.

We really have to win both of those matches to get the momentum going.”</p>\n<p>If it is going to earn these much-needed wins in Texas, UCSB is going to have to work hard to win at doubles — their Achilles’ heel in the last couple matches.</p>\n<p>“In singles we’re a really solid team,” junior Mathieu Forget said. “We can compete with anyone in our division. It’s true that we’ve been kind of weak in doubles. We lost our last two matches, and one of the reasons is that we lost at doubles. The doubles point is so important, so we need to work on that a lot and hopefully get that point back because it’s one of the most important points in the college match.”</p>\n<p>Davis has made doubles play a point of emphasis in recent practices, hoping to find a way to take the point in their upcoming matches.</p>\n<p>“We played a lot of doubles yesterday,” Recknagel said. “Pretty much the whole practice was just doubles, doubles situations, returns, all that kind of stuff.”</p>\n<p>After this weekend, the Gauchos return home to play Cal Poly and Loyola Marymount on April 16 and 17, respectively. The weekend concludes Big West regular season play before the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been traveling a lot. The season gets tiring,” Forget said. “It’s been hard, having to get used to different courts, dealing with the altitude in Utah and jet lag in Florida. Now that we’re coming home, we’re really excited.
