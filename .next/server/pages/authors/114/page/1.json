Pointing to an empty chair beside him, Cavarno emphasized that no one with an opposing view was present to make the case for the statistic, even after having sent out “hundreds of emails.”</p>\n<p>“Why is that chair empty?” Cavarno asked, “If all the evidence is truly on that side, if it is beyond reproach, if there’s no reason to debate this, then why is this chair empty?”</p>\n<p>Cavarno argued that while sexual assault on campuses is an important issue, the current system infringes upon due process rights.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of the numbers, we still have to have a system that works,” Cavarno said. “Regardless of whether its one in five or one in 50, we still need a system that allows survivors to receive support but also a system that does not infringe on the due process rights of accused students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There is absolutely no evidence of a rape epidemic on college campuses.” — Andrew Cavarno</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cavarno criticized a study conducted by the Association of American Universities, stating that it had a sample with an “extraordinarily low response rate” and an “over-broad definition of sexual assault.” He also argued that the study does not distinguish between acts of sexual assault and acts of sexual battery.</p>\n<p>“Both sexual assault and sexual battery are inexcusable, but they are not the same kind of action,” Cavarno said. “The one in five statistic on the other hand uses definitions that fail to distinguish between a girl getting her ass grabbed at a party and being forcibly penetrated, or having someone have sex with her when she is incapacitated.”</p>\n<p>Cavarno argued that the way schools handle sexual assault often ruins the careers and social lives of men by unfairly branding them as rapists. Cavarno then wrapped up his speech saying “feminism teaches the notion that men are not deserving of empathy,” concluding that “schools should not adjudicate sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>James Cornell, fourth-year electrical engineering major and Vice President of Young Americans for Liberty, said the speech was “very factual and academic.”</p>\n<p>“I think [the statistic] paints a very bad image of males in society and males on college campuses,” Cornell said. “It instills a lot of fear into women so they don’t feel safe on college campuses where they should be.”</p>\n<p>Katia Stern, a second-year financial math and statistics major, said that inflated statistics devalue the instances of more heinous cases of rape.</p>\n<p>“I think if the statistic is over-exaggerated it sort of devalues the worst cases of the rape, and it makes it seem like it’s a lot more prevalent and we start to consider really minor accusations in the compass of the broader definition of rape,” Stern said. “It kind of diminishes the value of individuals who are brutally raped.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a first-year anthropology major, who asked to remain anonymous, said universities should support victims of  sexual assault by providing programs like Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (CARE) and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that it’s wrong for universities to be involved in advocating for victims of sexual assault,” she said. “I was sexually assaulted as a minor and I feel like the system that I had before university has utterly failed me, and I feel like it’s very important to have CARE and CAPs and for this university to be very strict on people who are accused.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Amputation is a fairly common event in response to meningococcal infections.”</p>\n<p>Shane Yen, second-year pre-biology major and one of many students waiting in line to get a vaccination last Friday at the Health Center, said he was looking forward to receiving the vaccination.</p>\n<p>“I usually don’t look forward to getting shots,” Yen said. “But when you’ve got a deadly infection like meningitis, which could potentially kill you, I’m actually really eager to get this shot. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson provided tips for students to stay safe and prevent catching the disease and encouraged students to get the vaccine as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“The most important way to prevent this infection is to get the vaccine — that’s number one,” Robinson said. “Other than that, avoid people who are sick, try not to share secretions and be aware in overcrowded situations.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Robinson said the disease is contracted in social settings, which makes it especially important for college students to get the vaccine.</p>\n<p>“In times when there are outbreaks, visiting bars, drinking alcohol and smoking are also risk factors for catching it,” Robinson said. “But by far, the most important thing is to get the vaccine.”</p>\n<p>According to Dr. Robinson, the vaccine’s most common side effect is soreness at the injection site. Others can include fever, headaches and rare muscle aches, but these conditions are “a whole lot better than losing your life.”</p>\n<p>“The saddest thing as an infectious disease specialist is to see a young, intelligent, perfectly healthy student die or become maimed from this infection, when I know that it is preventable with a simple shot,” Dr. Robinson said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68465\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68465\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-22/student-health-provides-meningitis-b-vaccine/","id":2536,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2535,2534,2533],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie Hold Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Debate_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Debate_by-Spencer-Brandt-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"More than 80 students filled the Flying A room of the UCEN Tuesday to attend a formal debate between representatives from College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>More than 80 students filled the Flying A room of the UCEN Tuesday to attend a formal debate between representatives from College Republicans and UCSB for Bernie.</p>\n<p>After months of negotiations, the two groups, each represented by two debaters, held an event to discuss the feasibility of a higher minimum wage and tuition-free public college.

id=\"caption-attachment-68326\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Andrew Gates, second-year economics and accounting major and member of College Republicans, began the debate by questioning the demographics of minimum wage workers.</p>\n<p>“This popular belief that minimum wage workers are low-income adults working 40 plus hours a week to fend for their families and children is simply not true,” Gates said. “In actuality, only about 4.7 percent of minimum wage workers are low-income adults providing for their families.”</p>\n<p>Gates then cited the U.S. Department of Labor to claim minimum wage has negative effects on the economy and employment.</p>\n<p>“The US Department of Labor’s own assessment of the first minimum wage — this was commissioned by FDR — found that it resulted in job losses for 30,000 to 50,000 workers,” Gates said. “That’s 10 to 15 percent of the 300,000 workers who previously earned below that.”</p>\n<p>Eric Villalobos, third-year religious studies major and head organizer of UCSB for Bernie, argued in favor of a minimum wage increase.</p>\n<p>“A 2013 study by the Chicago Fed [Chicago Federal Reserve] found that increasing the minimum wage even just to $9 an hour would increase consumer spending by $28 billion,” Villalobos said. “It frees up money from the employer and from the business and makes it goes into the lower wage workers’ pockets.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said raising the minimum wage can lead to an increase in employment.</p>\n<p>“So far there is no evidence that raising the minimum wage causes an increase in unemployment or job loss,” Villalobos said. “In fact, in a Goldman-Sachs analysis of 13 states which have raised their minimum wage, it found that states where minimum wage went up had faster employment growth than states where the minimum wage remained at its 2013 level.”</p>\n<p>Ron Papile, third-year economics major and executive director of College Republicans, responded to Villalobos’ claim by citing studies on labor and the food industry that show prices rise with wages.</p>\n<p>“A 2007 study from the federal reserve bank of Chicago found that restaurant prices unambiguously increased in response to minimum wage,” Papile said. “Furthermore, a study by the German Institute for the Study of Labor found that, especially in fast food restaurants, roughly two-thirds of the minimum wage increase would actually lead to price increases.”</p>\n<p>Papile then discussed price increases in fast food restaurants.</p>\n<p>“Think about something like McDonald’s or Taco Bell, where you have a product that costs only $1 to buy – a $1 burger or taco,” Papile said. “The only reason that the prices are so low is because they’re matching the benefits they can get to the cost of creating the products.”</p>\n<p>Guy Singer, third-year biopsychology major and co-chair of UCSB for Bernie, had the last word on the issue of minimum wage.</p>\n<p>“600 of the nation’s most prolific economists authored a collective letter in 2014 supporting the notion that reasonable minimum wage increases had little or no effect on employment,” Singer said. “Even from the small business owner’s perspective there’s quite a tight consensus on raising the minimum wage.”</p>\n<p>The debate then shifted to the issue of whether or not public universities should be tuition free.</p>\n<p>Villalobos began by arguing that free tuition is not a new concept and has been implemented in many countries.</p>\n<p>“The campaign would like to argue that this is not a radical idea; last year Germany eliminated tuition because they believed that charging students $1,300 dollars per year was discouraging Germans from going to college,” Villalobos said. “Next year Chile will do the same, as will Finland, Norway, Sweden and many other countries around the world.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos then discussed democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ plan to address student loans.</p>\n<p>“The formula for setting student loan interest rates would go back to where it was in 2006,” Villalobos said. “If this plan were in effect today interest rates on undergrad loans would drop from 4.29 percent to just 2.37 percent.”</p>\n<p>Gates said government subsidies would actually increase the cost of tuitions.</p>\n<p>“As government subsidizes tuition, the cost of tuition increases proportionately,” Gates said. “The federal reserve bank of New York found that tuition and fees increased in proportion to the number of eligible students.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68325\"

subsequent crash.</p>\n<p>“In 1995 when the government subsidized mortgage loans, banks began loaning indiscriminately knowing that the government would cover it, increasing demand for housing and driving up prices of homes,” Gates said. “As government subsidizes, tuitions are hiked because colleges have no incentive to reign in that cost of tuition.”</p>\n<p>Singer responded by saying capable students should have the right to attend the colleges of their choice, regardless of income.</p>\n<p>“If you get accepted you should have the right to go to that university regardless of how much money your parents make,” Singer said. “The way we lose scientists and technological advancement is by selecting who gets to go university based on income.”</p>\n<p>Singer then defended the idea of socialism in public education.</p>\n<p>“A hundred years ago completely subsidized public high schools were called socialist, 300 years ago completely subsidized public elementary schools were called socialist, and now they say completely subsidized higher education is socialist,” Singer said. “How many times do we have to go through the process before we figure out that socialism isn’t a scary word?”</p>\n<p>Papile said the large increase in students at universities would negatively impact the ability of students to take impacted classes.</p>\n<p>“Graduating with a bachelor’s degree in six years is actually about 59 percent of students, which to me is a very shocking statistic and shows how impacted classes currently are and how difficult it is to get them,” Papile said. “If we flood colleges with more students, it’s only going to make classes harder to get into.”</p>\n<p>Papile also said private universities would be unable to compete with public universities if public university tuition was free.</p>\n<p>“How are private universities going to compete with public universities if public universities are going to offer free tuition,” Papile said.</p>\n<p>Emily Anne Williams, a first-year linguistics major, said she thought the debaters were well-informed and prepared.</p>\n<p>“I think both sides did very well,” Williams said. “I heard a lot of statistics thrown around, which I think most college students don’t know about, and it was nice to see four people who actually did research.”</p>\n<p>Daniel Reardon, third-year physics and philosophy double major and president of College Republicans, said he was happy with how the speakers handled the debate.</p>\n<p>“I was very pleasantly surprised and, honestly, there aren’t many ways it could have gone better,” Reardon said. “Nobody couldn’t answer a question, everyone was very well informed on the topic and I’m happy with how it went for both sides.”</p>\n<p>Emily Humpal, a third-year political science major, said she thought having the two clubs debate was beneficial for the student community.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s great that we have the two clubs coming together because we don’t have a lot of students active in the political arena,” Humpal said. “These issues affect us, and I think a lot more people need to know that.”</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: An initial version of this article listed the name of College Republicans’ executive director as Ron Kapeel, when his actual name is Ron Papile. Also, the article states the debate addressed whether the federal minimum wage should be raised from $7.25 to $15.00 over the next 8 years. However, the topic was an increase over several year, not 8 specifically.</em><em>]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/college-republicans-and-ucsb-for-bernie-hold-debate/","id":2529,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2528,2527,2526],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"D.R.E.A.M.

Loan Program will provide undocumented UC students with federal financial aid for the first time. <em>Photo Courtesy of CaliforniaStateGearUp.org</em></p></div>\n<p>The University of California is rolling out its D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program this academic year, providing an initial $5 million in federal aid to undocumented students across the UC system.</p>\n<p>The aid will be distributed to 3,000 undocumented students and will include more than approximately $350,000 to UCSB students. The money comes equally from the California state general fund, and UC funds and will be distributed to campuses based on need.</p>\n<p>Habiba Simjee, Undocumented Student Services Coordinator at UCSB and Undocumented Legal Services Counsel, said the program was a significant step toward addressing the financial struggles of undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“The D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program is an important step in addressing the significant funding gap for undocumented students who wish to pursue their education at UC schools,” Simjee said. “It’s been very challenging and heartbreaking to hear from students who have to withdraw or drop out because they’re unable to make ends meet, particularly when we consider the cost of living in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Michael Miller, director of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at UCSB, said the goal of the program is to make education more affordable for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“The goal of all financial aid funding is to ensure access and affordability for all UCSB students,” Miller said. “This loan program will be one more resource our D.R.E.A.M. Scholars have available to them, and, given the work and loan commitment all UCSB students assume while they are here, it is going to play a huge part in their ability to finance their education.”</p>\n<p>The D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program, proposed by UC President Janet Napolitano, was passed in 2014, but funding was not available for students until the current academic school year. Miller said the program helps level the playing field.</p>\n<p>“The creation of the D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program is a big step forward for D.R.E.A.M. Scholars across California, and it gets us closer to making sure they have the same resources available to them that other students have,” Miller said.</p>\n<p>Miller also made it clear that the University can do more for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“I am very proud of our campus, because our student leaders pushed for this program and their hard work paid off,” Miller said. “This program is a step in the right direction, but we still have a lot of work to do.”</p>\n<p>Claire Doan, a spokesperson for the UC Office of the President, said the program will help ease the financial burdens facing the undocumented student community.</p>\n<p>“The overall goal of the D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program is to help undocumented students who have limited financial options afford a UC education,” Doan said. “It helps alleviate the burden for undocumented UCSB students, many of whom are often forced to take semesters off or take outside jobs to offset the cost of tuition.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, the average UCSB student graduates with about $21,000 in student loan debt.</p>\n<p>“Student loans are widely used by students to pay for education-related expense like tuition and fees, room and board and books and supplies,” Miller said. “The D.R.E.A.M. Loan program will help eligible students meet these expenses.”</p>\n<p>Under current laws, undocumented students who graduate from high schools in California can apply for state and university aid, but their status as undocumented students prevents them from obtaining federal aid.</p>\n<p>Ricardo Leon, second-year computer engineering major, said he expects the D.R.E.A.M. Loan Program will help offset the lack of federal funding.</p>\n<p>“The program will help [undocumented students] because they’re not eligible for federal aid, so they don’t get the Cal Grant, and they also can’t get loans through the federal government,” Leon said. “Having the government give them some loan money would be really helpful.”</p>\n<p>Leon said the program would help undocumented students focus more on their education and less on their finances.</p>\n<p>“A lot of undocumented students have to get jobs in order to get that extra funding and make ends meet,” Leon said. “I think a loan would help them focus more on their studies.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

At one point, student protesters wearing duct tape over their mouths went inside the Career Fair and blocked the path to the CBP booth before being directed by protest organizers to return outside and continue chanting.</p>\n<p>Lorena Alvarez, second-year English major and publicity co-chair of the Associated Students Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee, helped organize the event and said she was inspired by the students who participated.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been working tirelessly with the coalition that essentially planned this protest,” Alvarez said. “I’m very proud to have taken part in the planning and I’m just inspired by all the people who came out today and the fact that we were able to make our presence known.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the event was meant to serve as a message that the university should stand by its status as a Hispanic-Serving Institution.</p>\n<p>“As a Hispanic-Serving Institute, I feel like we should stick by that name and have students feel safe on this campus,” Alvarez said. “By having Customs and Border Patrol on campus, they absolutely do not feel safe; a lot of my friends were triggered today and I blame Career Services and the university for not protecting them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67778\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67778\" data-attachment-id=\"67778\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/protest_by-andrew-gates-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Career Fair Protest\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67778\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Andrew Gates / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Protest_by-Andrew-Gates-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67778\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Andrew Gates / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Clinton Cox, a supervisory border patrol agent of Customs and Border Protection, said CBP was at the Career Fair to provide information and opportunities to interested students, and that CBP’s goal is to defend American borders.</p>\n<p>“We’re here to offer advice and potential career opportunities to all the students who are interested here,” Cox said. “We’re America’s front-line defense against terrorists and terrorist weapons, and we try to prevent the illegal flow of illicit material and/or narcotics and contraband, and to facilitate trade.”</p>\n<p>Outside the MCC, four protesters covered in fake blood lay motionless on the ground, representing the undocumented migrants who died trying to cross the border into the United States. Around them, protesters yelled, “¡La gente unida jamás será vencida!” meaning “The people united will never be defeated!”</p>\n<p>Juan Gonzalez, fourth-year economics and accounting major, said the protest was an affirmation of human rights.</p>\n<p>“It’s obviously a good thing because we’re protesting human rights violations,” Gonzalez said. “There’s a lot of people who die trying to cross the border, trying to have a better life, and these immigration officers make it harder than it’s supposed to be, so I think it’s good to bring attention to these issues.”</p>\n<p>About three hours into the event, protesters marched into the MCC and stood in front of the CBP booth, holding up signs and wearing duct tape over their mouths, before being directed by protest organizers to return outside and continue chanting.</p>\n<p>Cox said CBP was not upset by the protest and encouraged peaceful demonstration.</p>\n<p>“They have a belief that they believe in, and they don’t necessarily believe in the mission that we are tasked to do,” Cox said. “As long as it’s a peaceful demonstration, it doesn’t bother us one bit, and we encourage people to exercise their first amendment right.”</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the event, tensions flared as a number of students with dissenting opinions arrived outside the MCC to talk with some of the protest’s supporters.</p>\n<p>Jason Garshfield, fourth-year political science major, said he felt the protest was ineffective in creating a discussion about immigration laws.</p>\n<p>“They’re angry that CBP is having a booth at the Career Fair, and I think that’s somewhat silly because those agents aren’t here to deport anyone,” Garshfield said. “I don’t totally approve of our immigration laws—I think they need to be reformed and I think that that’s a legitimate debate—but when you get 100 people together chanting the same slogan, that’s not something that’s encouraging debate.”</p>\n<p>Rick Zierer, first-year political science major, said enforcement of American borders is necessary.</p>\n<p>“In a society, you have to enforce laws, and those laws exist, be they just or unjust,” Zierer said. “There are ways that we can look about maybe making legal immigration easier. We can look at more common-sense solutions than just allowing no enforcement of the border, which potentially could be very harmful to the migrants themselves.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, Associated Students senator and third-year Chican@ studies and sociology double major, helped organize the event and said the protest showcased the need for the university to provide more resources to the undocumented community.</p>\n<p>“I believe we need to support the undocumented community because they need more resources on our campus,” Melgoza said. “And as a research institution, we should able to provide the services that we need for our community.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67780\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67780\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-29/students-protest-u-s-customs-and-border-protection-booth-at-career-fair/","id":2566,"author":{"id":114,"name":"Hubert Zhang"},"related":[2565,2564,2563],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.
