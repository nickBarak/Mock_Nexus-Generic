It also facilitates educational outreach initiatives regarding LGBTQ members to the general community and has helped in putting on drag shows, educational workshops and lecturing and speaking events.</p>\n<p>Out of the $2.12 collected in the Queer Commission’s new fee, $0.53 will be for a 25 percent return-to-aid, $0.10 will be for a 7 percent administrative assessment collected on all non-capital expenditures, $0.01 will be for the 1 percent A.S. recharge fee and $1.48 will be given directly to the Queer Commission.</p>\n<p>According to Dave Whitman, Interim Director of the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department (WGSE), the Queer Commission hit a “breaking point” last year when its budget was proposed to be cut to an “all-time low.” Whitman said the group decided to propose the fee initiative to tackle these budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“This year, instead of going to Senate to ask them to not approve the cutting of their budget anymore, they decided to go straight to the entire student body for support,” Whitman said. “This way, the student body can decide collectively if a strong Queer Commission is valuable to this campus.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of the Queer Commission Andrew Farkash said the purpose of the initiative is to not only gain funding to hold events but also give students a chance to attend LGBTQ national conferences for education and personal growth.</p>\n<p>“It teaches students about a lot of different issues and gets them more involved in the activism, in the commission and in the community in general,” Farkash said.</p>\n<p>According to Farkash, the lack of funding for the Queer Commission has negatively affected LGBTQ organizations on campus by impacting regularly held events, activities and meetings.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had to give out less money, so it’s kind of hurt their events because the Queer Commission exists mainly to support the queer community and the different queer organizations,” Farkash said. “We’re also hurting … their ability to have regular events, to have regular meetings, to keep interest in their members, to advocate on campus and so on.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, April 17, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54894\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54894\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-17/queer-commission-fees-to-appear-on-upcoming-a-s-ballot/","id":3032,"author":{"id":188,"name":"Dustin Chan"},"related":[3031,3030,3029],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/188"}},"__N_SSG":true}
