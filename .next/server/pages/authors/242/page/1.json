Jugglers with a variety of styles and talents will perform at I.V. Theater on Saturday evening. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I.V. was the first juggling festival I ever attended,” he said. “The public show definitely helped my career path as a performer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was first held in 1976 to honor local juggler and UCSB student Patty Laney, according to Fiasco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laney, who was 21 at the time of her death, had been an avid juggler and activist for women’s rights on campus before her murder. In her honor, the juggling community of I.V. began organizing a benefit show which ultimately turned into the now-three-day festival. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is an extremely welcoming environment and commonplace for people to approach total strangers for help or to engage in group juggle passing,” Fiasco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profits from the festival will be donated to the Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) organization, formerly named Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83049\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83049\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/annual-juggling-festival-returns-to-i-v/","id":4278,"author":{"id":242,"name":"Anyi Cheng"},"related":[4277,4276,4275],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Proposed Calif.

The more it makes us money, the less we rely on foreign oil,” she said.</p>\n<p>Fergus explained that allowing offshore drilling would be an enormous step backward in efforts to convert UCSB into an environmentally friendly campus.</p>\n<p>California’s exemption from the DPP would have positive political implications by forcing transportation and energy industries to turn to alternative, more sustainable resources such as wind and solar energy, Fergus said.</p>\n<p>Matias Eusterbrock, a fourth-year sociology and economics double major and vice chair of UCSB’s Coastal Fund, said that increased oil development makes clean energy seem like a better alternative.</p>\n<p>“I think that by not relying on such harmful forms of energy both in extraction and use, we incentivize the innovation that we need,” Eusterbrock said.</p>\n<p>CALPIRG recently released an email petition for campus community members to sign in opposition of offshore oil drilling. The group’s goal is to make the UCSB campus run on 100 percent renewable energy, according to Fergus.</p>\n<p>“There’s no safe way to drill for oil and transport oil,” said Liam Horstick, campus organizer of UCSB CALPIRG. “We shouldn’t be drilling for more fossil fuels, anyway, because of the impact to climate change and 100 percent renewable energy.”</p>\n<p>Joan Hartmann, third district supervisor and Santa Barbara County representative, is currently working on several projects to push the county toward more sustainable sources of energy.</p>\n<p>According to an email statement from Hartmann, such projects include “evaluating Community Choice Energy, increasing buildout local distributed energy resources such as solar, demanding response and energy storage to create a more resilient energy system and promoting zero emission vehicles and infrastructure for these vehicles that don’t have internal combustion engines.”</p>\n<p>The Dos Cuadros oil field holds about 11.4 million accessible barrels of crude oil under the Santa Barbara Channel and is part of what attracts oil companies to California’s Central Coast. The federally leased field is regulated by the DOI, not the state of California.</p>\n<p>In early 1969, a well blowout about 10 miles from Santa Barbara’s coast in the Dos Cuadras field caused the spill of roughly 100,000 barrels of crude oil into the Santa Barbara Channel, polluting beaches from Goleta to Ventura and on four of the Channel Islands.</p>\n<p>Over 3,600 sea birds died, along with fish, barnacles and some marine mammals. The spill resulted in $9.5 million of commercial and private property damage.</p>\n<p>The platform that caused the spill is currently still in operation today, along with its three sibling platforms.</p>\n<p>The effects of the spill contributed to the passage of several environmental protection acts as well as the establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the California Coastal Commission.</p>\n<p>A major spill occurred again in 2015, when a Plains All American pipeline burst, sending 3,400 barrels of crude oil into the waters of Refugio State Beach. The pipeline has now been closed.</p>\n<p>The 1969 and 2015 oil spills have served as points of reference for many opponents of the DOI’s movement to open coastal waters to drilling.</p>\n<p>“The Central Coast knows all too well the risks that oil drilling poses to our communities, and I will continue to urge this Administration to take our coastline off the negotiating table,” Carbajal said in his statement.</p>\n<p>Since 1969, the California States Lands Commission has not granted any new offshore drilling leases within its jurisdiction limit of three miles off the coast, though existing operations were allowed to continue.</p>\n<p>The DOI temporarily paused operations on California’s Outer Continental Shelf following the 1969 spill until the passages of the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act in 1970.</p>\n<p>Another major component of the opposition to the proposal is California’s economy. According to Hartmann, coastal recreational, fishing and tourism are essential to the state’s thriving economy and the proposed program could be extremely detrimental to such industries.</p>\n<p>Like California, coastal states across the country rose in opposition against the BOEM’s proposed plan. Governors in Washington and Oregon joined Brown to sign a joint statement in early January saying that the states would take any measure to prevent oil drilling.</p>\n<p>“They’ve chosen to forget the utter devastation of past offshore oil spills … They’ve chosen to ignore the science that tells us our climate is changing and we must reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. But we won’t forget history or ignore science,” the statement read.</p>\n<p>The BOEM is currently holding public meetings across the country regarding each coastal state’s stance on drilling.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 15, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/proposed-calif-offshore-oil-drilling-faces-opposition/","id":3935,"author":{"id":242,"name":"Anyi Cheng"},"related":[3934,3933,3932],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Composer Souren Baronian Dazes MCC Armenian Jazz","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/12033362364_559624c195_b.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/12033362364_559624c195_b.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"From the very first notes, Taksim captured the attention of the entire audience.

Baronian was raised in East Harlem and, in his youth, infamously snuck into performances on New York City’s jazz center 52nd Street. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was under furtive entrance to those clubs where he discovered jazz legends such as Lester Young and Billie Holiday. Young and Holiday ultimately served as some of Baronian’s greatest influences on the music he has been composing and performing since 1975. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baronian is the bandleader of Taksim, which features instruments both achingly familiar — the clarinet, the bass, the sax — and keenly exotic —the duduk, the riq, the dombek. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kara Newman, a fourth-year microbiology major, was one of the students in attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I love sound, and this is a very distinct sound,” she said. “I love it. They’ve got a really interesting blend.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point during the show, oudist Haig Manoukian pulled out what appeared to be a wooden recorder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “I’ve got this instrument here; paid three dollars for it,” he said. “Let’s see what it sounds like.” The band picked up a slow, dramatic prelude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sounds like a funeral march, doesn’t it?” joked Manoukian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He began playing the instrument, immediately enrapturing the crowd. Eventually, the notes grew too high for the whistle, and Manoukian compromised by singing the notes in “doots,” drawing roaring laughter from the audience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good humor like this took the concert’s atmosphere a step up from that of a mere musical performance, as did the clear camaraderie between the band members. As they played, Taksim’s performers weren’t looking at sheet music. Instead, they made frequent eye contact with one another and with audience members alike, nodding to the beat with appreciative smiles and full confidence in their performance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such chemistry among the band members was particularly delightful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m loving the way they feed off each other,” Newman said. “It’s great to watch them and see the conversation in their eyes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concentration of each performer was clearly intense. In a brief break between songs, bassist Sprocket Royer paused to wipe the sweat off his forehead. Drummer Mal Stein frequently closed his eyes as he played, fully immersed in his rhythms. The conclusion of each song was met with enthusiastic applause punctuated with the occasional appreciative whistle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a jazz fan, Newman liked seeing elements of jazz shine through in each song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You get a lot of great improvisation and a lot of great call and response, which I love to see,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A handful of times throughout the night, Manoukian would pause after a song and look around at his bandmates for prompts on what to perform next. Taksim’s easy-going attitude toward playing music and performing for a crowd made the entire performance truly unique. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not always sure what we want to play,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the ringing conclusion of their final song almost two and a half hours after they began, Taksim’s performance prompted a well-deserved standing ovation. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80649\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/composer-souren-baronian-dazes-mcc-armenian-jazz/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80649\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/composer-souren-baronian-dazes-mcc-armenian-jazz/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/composer-souren-baronian-dazes-mcc-armenian-jazz/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/composer-souren-baronian-dazes-mcc-armenian-jazz/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-30/composer-souren-baronian-dazes-mcc-armenian-jazz/","id":6669,"author":{"id":242,"name":"Anyi Cheng"},"related":[6668,6667,6666],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/242"}},"__N_SSG":true}
