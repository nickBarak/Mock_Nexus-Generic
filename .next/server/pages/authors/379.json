","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing up in the Japanese-American community, there were some activities that were simply commonplace. Before picking up our chopsticks, my father and I would always place our palms together and say </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itadakimasu </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to express thanks for the savory bowl of somen noodles on our table. After dinner, I’d mount my plastic stool, meet my 5’2” mother at eye level and roll tiny onigiri balls at her side for my school lunch the next day. At my after school program, Nihonmachi Little Friends, we would procrastinate on our homework by debating who had the fanciest three-layer pencil case or the rarest type of Iwako take-apart eraser. After homework time, the musically talented would go to taiko practice, and the athletes to karate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the sun began to set, our senseis would try to calm our undying energy by reading us a story such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Momotarō </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(“The Peach Boy”) or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urishima Tarō </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(“The Fisher Lad”). After this failed, they would scatter square-shaped papers of various colors and prints over the short-legged craft tables and we students would gather around in stout plastic chairs to fold origami. Within minutes, sparkly purple fish would swim across the table, green polka-dotted butterflies would flutter through the air and orange jumping frogs would hop all over the room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Folding origami was my favorite activity, simply because it was fun. It was a way for me to make new decorations for my bedroom. It gave me the means to create tiny boxes perfect for holding the rocks, beads and other priceless treasures I collected from the playground floor. Best of all, it gave me an excuse to make ninja stars that I could chuck at my friends without consequence.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Sadako was two years old and living near Hiroshima when the United States dropped its first atomic bomb on the city during World War II. Due to radiation exposure, she fell ill with leukemia in adolescence and began to grow terribly weak. Her distraught father uncovered a Japanese legend that promises anyone who folds </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(one thousand paper cranes) a wish granted by the gods. Sadako’s friends and family gathered as a community to fold the cranes in order to grant their loved one the wish of a return to health. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspired by the girls in the story whose ages were near my own, I decided to take a break from the mischievous ninja stars and put my origami skills to the test by folding cranes. At first I had little luck. My first bird bore an enormous beak and resembled a pelican, mouth full of fish. My second bird came out lopsided as if it had fallen from its nest in infancy and broken its wing. I nevertheless kept folding, and, with time, perfected the crisp lines and sharp edges of a perfect origami crane. From then on, cranes remained my origami of choice</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout middle and high school, I used crane-folding as a way to pass time, to upcycle paper that would otherwise be discarded or to calm my mind when I became caught up in boy drama. I folded hundreds of cranes as did Sadako, but for me, it was always just a fun pastime. I never imagined myself in such a situation calling for a serious role of origami.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If something as simple as folding paper birds can rally a disconnected community and encourage a patient of brain trauma to persevere, the definition of “support” should be infinite.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the summer of 2014, I received terrible news. My mother’s best friend, Beckie, who since my birth had been like a second mother to me, had been in a traumatic bicycle accident. On a sunny weekend ride, she had fallen to the ground and hit her head. The specialists placed her in a medically induced coma, leaving her entirely unconscious for weeks. This woman was my role model, a female, Japanese-American icon, who had devoted her life to helping other women of color less privileged than she was. I felt lost and helpless. As friends and family rallied to raise funds to pay her outrageous hospital bills, I wallowed with frustration in my helplessness. After all, I was only 16 years old with no money to give, no driver’s license to help with transportation, nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One night as I lay awake worrying about the future of Beckie’s condition, I decided to fold some origami to stop my mind from circling. I anxiously ripped my old geometry syllabus into a square and began to fold. As I tucked the sides of the paper into its deep pleats, I began to question why I was folding paper at two in the morning. My mind wandered back to the sailing ninja stars and jumping frogs at Nihonmachi, until it stopped at the story of Sadako Sasaki, the girl who folded 1,000 cranes. Dazed and exhausted, inspired yet afraid, I asked myself, “Could cranes like these be used to heal Beckie?” I stared at the tiny paper mass in the palm of my clammy hand, then quickly tossed it aside. It was a senseless idea; even with the help of my mother and a few dedicated friends, there was no way we would be able to fold the 1,000 cranes needed to grant Beckie the wish of revival. I turned over in bed, forced my eyes shut and urged sleep to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next morning at breakfast, my mother notified me that Beckie’s brain had begun to swell. At risk of oxygen deprivation due to intracranial pressure, she would be</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">undergoing a fluid drainage procedure to help alleviate this pressure.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stunned by the news, I blurted out the 1,000 crane idea I had shot down the night prior, then crumpled with embarrassment at my impulsive absurdity. To my surprise, my mom praised my idea and encouraged me to move forward with it.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87576\" style=\"width: 589px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87576\" data-attachment-id=\"87576\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/beyond-bills-the-power-of-paper/nexuspapercranes-copy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?fit=650%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"650,338\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"nexuspapercranes copy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?fit=250%2C130&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?fit=888%2C462&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87576\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nexuspapercranes-copy-e1555578357651.png?resize=579%2C301\" alt=\"\" width=\"579\" height=\"301\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87576\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Komessar / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That week, I collected the emails of around 100 of Beckie’s friends, family members, ex-classmates and colleagues. I typed out a message with a short description of the 1,000 cranes legend and a simple explanation of how to fold them. The email was set and ready to go, yet I still questioned my endeavor: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will these people even see the value in origami? They all have busy schedules. Why would they take time out of their day to learn how to fold paper? </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought of failure and the humiliation of being the 16 year old girl who thought she could persuade individuals whom she had never met to join her in a paper folding project. Dwelling in apprehension, my mind flashed to the thought of Beckie’s upcoming procedure. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What strength it must take to undergo an operation like that.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If Beckie, my role model, could undergo a brain operation, I should be able to send an email. With the click of a paper airplane, I sent my hopes flying to inboxes all over the country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the month, I found my mailbox stuffed daily with origami cranes on papers of assorted colors and patterns sent from Beckie’s loved ones in states I had never before visited; Minnesotans and New Yorkers</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alike were eager to contribute. Multiple packages from the East Coast came with letters expressing gratitude for the project. These individuals felt that cranes enabled them to connect to Beckie despite the fact that they lived thousands of miles away. They had been looking for a way to support, and this project gave them just that. Empowered by the community’s devotion, my mom and I quickly got to work stringing the little birds into strands of 40.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After seeing my seemingly ineffectual hobby prevail with a power I never could have imagined, I move forward with confidence in my abilities, in my passions, in myself.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After two months of unpacking overstuffed envelopes, sorting the origami by color and carefully running our needles through the birds’ delicate backs, we reached 25 strands. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was complete. Born from the hands of individuals living thousands of miles apart, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,000 paper cranes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> swayed together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a warm September Saturday afternoon, my mom and I hopped in our silver Prius to deliver the multicolored flock to Beckie. By this time, her recovery had progressed and she was back living at her home in the East Bay. When we pulled into her steep driveway, I felt my heart beating so loudly I wondered if my mom could hear it. I couldn’t decide if it was out of nervousness or excitement </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">probably a bit of both. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beckie greeted us at her front door. She looked different. Her hair was short as it had been shaved for her procedures. She looked tired. She walked slowly, taking each step with care. Although no longer hospitalized, she still had a long road to recovery. Yet, despite all the progress to be made, she bore the same kind-eyed smile that has never ceased to shine for as long as I’ve known her. When we revealed the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to Beckie, she accepted it with reverence, calling it a “life-saving gift.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_87572\" style=\"width: 518px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87572\" data-attachment-id=\"87572\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/beyond-bills-the-power-of-paper/cranemail/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?fit=2048%2C1275&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1275\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"cranemail\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?fit=888%2C553&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-87572\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=508%2C316\" alt=\"\" width=\"508\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cranemail.png?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-87572\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Komessar / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, four and a half years later, Beckie has fully recovered from her brain trauma. She hikes on the weekends, cooks delicious </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chawanmushi </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(savory egg custard) and continues her work in social justice. One thousand cranes hang in her living room, a reminder of hope and healing, compassion and community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these tiny paper birds give the gift of life, their sheer existence depends on generations passing down the knowledge of their creation. Hence, they serve as reminders of the Japanese cultural history, passed down through generations. They serve as agents of hope for the future yet to come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senbazuru </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project, I felt young, useless and incapable of making a difference. I doubted my worth as a meager 16 year old with nothing but empty pockets and a passion for folding paper. But after seeing my seemingly ineffectual hobby prevail with a power I never could have imagined, I move forward with confidence in my abilities, in my passions, in myself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s often assumed that donating money is the most effective way of supporting a cause. Political candidates solicit monetary contributions to fund their campaigns, nonprofits asks for donations to enable their efforts, crowdfunding websites such as GoFundMe set clear-cut financial goals that can only be met with money. Those lacking financial means unfortunately fall outside the scope of individuals deemed capable of enacting change. Yet, these penniless souls may possess creative and alternative talents, which hold a transformative potential of their own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to imply that people should not give money to the causes they endorse. After all, Beckie’s recovery would not have been possible had she not been able to pay her hospital bills. However, this is to say that money is not everything. If something as simple as folding paper birds can rally a disconnected community and encourage a patient of brain trauma to persevere, the definition of “support” should be infinite.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miya Herzstein encourages others to rethink their change-making capability.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/miyaherzstein/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Miya Herzstein</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Miya Herzstein is an Opinion Staff writer.

For the majority of my life, I identified with this sentiment so when the rain began this winter quarter, I was all but excited. I would wake up to the patter of rain on my windowsill and roll over in bed unenthused about what lay ahead of me: just another day of wrangling the pesky zippers of my raincoat that always seem to get caught on the surrounding fabric; another day of battling the faulty umbrella button whose only purpose is to open up the simple device, but always seems to fail at doing just that; another day destined to be ruined by factors out of my control. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular Tuesday during week four, my skin felt especially sticky and my hair exceptionally frizzy from the humidity of my soggy classrooms. I was yearning especially hard for my shower of revitalization. On my walk back home, I texted my housemate to assure that the shower would be free upon my arrival. While looking down at my phone, I carelessly stepped in a puddle, soaking my socks all the way though. I bit my lip, let out a sigh and trudged on with the the words “I hate the rain” circling through my mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I reached the bus loop roundabout, a guy sheltering himself with not one but two umbrellas biked past me. As I watched him ride away, I pondered the effectiveness of this strategy. I decided that Melania Trump could probably benefit from the second umbrella better than he could, although it was not my place to make suggestions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I continued on past SSMS, I noticed a bicyclist with something on his head. “A helmet?” I thought. “That’s rare to see at UCSB.” But alas, it was something even rarer — a plastic bag crafted into a rain mask, eye-holes and all. I remember in childhood being strictly informed to never put a plastic bag over my head to avoid accidental suffocation. I guess this principle becomes null when facing the threat of getting one’s cheeks a little wet. This irony amused me as I walked onward.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86444\" style=\"width: 391px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86444\" data-attachment-id=\"86444\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-27/take-a-rain-check-on-your-rain-resentment/screen-shot-2019-02-25-at-1-57-49-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?fit=1288%2C1290&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1288,1290\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-02-25 at 1.57.49 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?fit=888%2C890&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-86444\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM-250x250.png?resize=381%2C381\" alt=\"\" width=\"381\" height=\"381\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=768%2C769&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=1022%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1022w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-25-at-1.57.49-PM.png?w=1288&amp;ssl=1 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-86444\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christine Kim / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The path began to veer left, wrapping its way around the Thunderdome. The sparsity of buildings in this area of campus means less shelter, so I quickly felt the wind pick up around me. I held my hand in front of my face to shield my eyes from the raindrops darting about. While this did obstruct my vision to a considerable degree, I could not help but notice a massive pink blob making its way toward me. I let down my hand to discover a girl walking to class with a giant One Direction blanket wrapped around her shoulders. She had neither a raincoat nor an umbrella, just Harry Styles to protect her from the rain. Raindrops rolled down his cheeks from his deep blue eyes. It looked as if he was weeping while bearing his charming dimpled smile. I chuckled to myself at this ridiculous sight.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I let down my hand to discover a girl walking to class with a giant One Direction blanket wrapped around her shoulders.

Usually, I would have viewed the glittering “Hesperous is Phosphorus” as the literal light at the end of the tunnel of my wet, gloomy trek back to I.V. This time, however, the landmark did not strike me so. There was no bad mood to overcome. I was already content. In analyzing the innovative rain repellant strategies along my walk, I had shed my deep-rooted aversion to the rain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These past few weeks, when I awake to the pattering on my windowsill, I cannot say that I spring up out of bed ready to splash around in puddles belting “I’m Singin’ in the Rain.” I can say, however, that I no longer dread my drizzly walk to class the way I used to. Before, the rain to me was simply an oppressive force, dictating the clothes I’d wear, the places I’d go and my means of getting there. Yet, in recognizing the funky quirks and crafty contraptions that the rain brings out in my fellow Isla Vistans, I am able to find joy in my community, rain or shine.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miya Herzstein encourages Gauchos to embrace the rain.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e51769e2acb2b987751634ecfbe7b63f?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/miyaherzstein/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Miya Herzstein</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Miya Herzstein is an Opinion Staff writer.

Of course, I kept in mind that salads were a healthy alternative to hamburgers, but I nevertheless enjoyed late nights at In-N-Out with my friends from time to time. I ate primarily balanced meals at home and enjoyed dessert in moderation. My day-to-day life was always filled with physical activity. I rode my bike five miles to school every morning, dog-walked four times a week to make a little extra money, taught children’s dance classes and then took my own classes as well. On weekends, I would take hikes with my friends and family as well as go running atop the hill behind my house. Thus, I never put too much thought into the foods I was eating because all of my physical activity balanced out the food that I would consume.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85449\" style=\"width: 279px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85449\" data-attachment-id=\"85449\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-07/a-revived-relationship-with-food/food-article/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-85449\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article-188x250.jpg?resize=269%2C358\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/food-article.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jessica Bixby / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going to college was the first time in my life that I would be living away from home. I would now have many new responsibilities, one of them being managing my own food. Fully wary of the freshman 15, I decided to pay close attention to my diet and exercise routine in order to avoid falling into this common fate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning, my plan bore nothing but favorable</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">effects. I ate fruit with my breakfast each morning and made sure to balance every lunch and every dinner with a salad. I enjoyed checking UCSB NetNutrition before serving myself in the dining commons, just to be knowledgeable about the ingredients I was putting on my plate. I began drinking more water and tried to exercise every other day. These were all positive changes in that they got me into a healthy routine among a time of such great change. My skin became clearer and I no longer fell into exhausted slumps after eating as I sometimes would after consuming those heavy In-N-Out burgers. I had never really paid attention to nutrition while living at home, so I felt a mature sense of agency through being able to control the way in which I was powering my body. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these were positive changes to begin with, the goodness was not to last. My careful attention grew into an all-encompassing obsession that bled into every aspect of my life in innumerable negative ways. The health-conscious decisions that started as choices became rules to be followed at all costs: Always drink coffee before breakfast to suppress appetite. Never eat meat. If there is a low-cal alternative, always choose it. Bread, pasta and and rice are all absolute no’s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Checking NetNutrition became the definitive criteria for picking a dining hall. If my friends invited me to Ortega but Carillo served more balanced options, I would formulate some lie explaining why I could not join them, then walk all the way around the lagoon alone in order eat a light meal of low-calorie polenta topped with microgreens. I was never one to skip class in high school, nor at the beginning of college. However, as my fixation progressed, my priorities began to change. If I knew that I would be expected to eat cake for a friend’s birthday that evening, I would skip class in order to make time to exercise so that what I burned would balance out what I ate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weighing myself became as much a part of my daily routine as brushing my teeth. I tracked every calorie I ate down to a pinch of vegan parmesan atop my zoodles. I fidgeted throughout all my lectures because sitting still meant minimal calorie burn and minimal calorie burn was bad. When not in lecture, I could be found on a Rec Cen elliptical, pushing my undernourished body to its max. Though I was already quite lean upon entering college, by the end of my freshman year, I had lost 15 percent of my body weight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although these behaviors arose when I went away to college, they did not cease when I returned home for the summer. I remember getting invited to a pizza party by a dear high school friend. Although I had no plans for that evening and had not seen my high school friends in six months, I declined the offer. I valued saving the calories by staying home alone more than sharing pizza and good times with friends. The few times I did see my friends, they noted my weight change and concernedly questioned my well-being. I blamed the “pesky dorm plague” for my lack of appetite.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew that my tendencies were detrimental to my everyday life, but I was so fixated upon the number on the scale that I didn’t care. I stopped getting my period, stopped enjoying spending time with friends and stopped caring about things that were non-food-related.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was one thing, however, that my fixation did not destroy: my dream of studying abroad. After only a few days in Paris for a family vacation when I was 10, I became infatuated by the French language, music and way of life. Since then, I aspired to spend my junior year of college sipping warm espressos reading </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Le Petit Prince</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in cozy cafés.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was struck with elation upon receiving my acceptance email from the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) for the University of Bordeaux’s study abroad program. In a few short months, my decade-long dream would finally materialize. Yet, before departing, I would have to fill out all the mandatory paperwork, one of which was the housing preference form.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My options were single apartment, shared apartment and homestay. Pondering these options, my head began to swirl. I knew that living in a homestay with a French family would be the best way for me to truly experience the French culture in which I so yearned to be immersed. However, choosing a homestay meant living by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">someone else’s</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rules, adhering to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> schedule and, by all means, eating </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">food. I shuddered at the idea of willingly forfeiting my diet of kale smoothies, cauliflower rice and tofu scrambles for the rich, creamy, meat-heavy, veggie-lacking French cuisine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite my fear of gaining weight and renouncing all the “healthy changes” I had made during my first two years of college, I did not want to let my obsession tarnish my long-held dream. I checked the homestay box on the form, then closed my laptop with trembling hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I arrived at my homestay, I walked into a home very different from what I was used to; it was exactly what I had dreamed of and more. My host mother’s dwelling was classic Bordelaise, crafted of white limestone and furnished with sun-faded vintage wood. Verdant plants surrounded the living room piano, and books with yellowed pages bound to cracking spines filled the shelves. Her kitchen had 50 of everything — spoons, forks, knives, bowls, plates, cups, wine glasses — and with these abundant apparatuses, she had delicately prepared an exquisite dish of spaghetti Bolognese to welcome me. When I saw the steaming plate on the table, my excitement extinguished in a snap. Red meat, olive oil and carb-heavy spaghetti — it was three evils in one, all teaming up on me to corrupt my regimen. Nevertheless, I knew that sharing the meal was the right thing to do. I pushed aside my thoughts and got to know my host mother over our plates. Her warmth made me feel welcome and comfortable, and my anxiety about the food began to slip away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout my first few weeks, each meal felt like a mountain to be scaled. Yet, after reaching the summit and laying my cutlery aside my plate, I felt not accomplishment, but guilt. However, over time, I learned to enjoy the view. The creaminess of warm-buttered purée, the tantalizing juices of duck confit and the heavy richness of quiche Lorraine … These are all plates that I never would have dreamed of tasting before studying abroad but now cannot imagine my experience without. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I enjoyed the new flavors and began to seek out more. After hearing that France’s best-rated viennoiserie was situated in Bordeaux, I eagerly took a special trip downtown to sample its chocolatine. On a weekend trip to Lyon, France’s gastronomic capital, I eagerly tasted the buttery culinary specialty of foie gras. Throughout my study abroad experience I sampled canel</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">és, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the classic Bordelaise pastry flavored with rum and vanilla, from multiple shops, in order to discover the best one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My newfound joy for food spilled over into other facets of my life. I rediscovered interests which had been so long ignored while I was carefully counting the cherry tomatoes on my salad and logging them into my calorie-counting app. I now had the time to create things and started writing a blog about my study abroad adventures. I went out to bars with friends and ordered the drinks that looked appealing to me — even if they were made with non-diet tonic water! I spent lazy Saturday mornings reading poetry in my sunlit living room, fidget-free and entirely content. I finally saw the value in a life centered around the pursuit of joy instead of a quest to fit into double zero jeans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on the past four months, I am astounded at how much I’ve changed. Living with a French host family incentivized me to stray from my “perfectly clean diet” in order to create true familial connections. Being surrounded by a gastronomy-centered society prompted me to let down my guard surrounding food in order to experience its cultural beauty in entirety. Thus, studying abroad gave me more than just change of scenery; it also allowed me a change in the way I view my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d be lying if I said that my conscience doesn’t sometimes flicker when I take a bite of chocolate cake. But the relics of my past mentality never trump my newfound desire to engage in life’s pleasures. I love food, as well as the countless lessons and connections that it can bring.
