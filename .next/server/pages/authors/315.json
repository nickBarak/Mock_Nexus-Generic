Nicolas Eitelbach / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As the weather becomes colder and the fall quarter winds down on campus, so do on-field activities for the UCSB baseball program. After a difficult season last year, finishing with an overall record of 24-32, many others and I were interested to see what would happen to the Gauchos once fall arrived.</p>\n<p>As autumn came and went, the same fall ball clichés that happen to every team across the country occurred; players fought for spots, many took advantage of the weight room and some guys who you thought wouldn’t struggle did, while others you would not expect to do well flourished.</p>\n<p>This is all too typical of fall college baseball. There were, however, several unique and interesting storylines that arose, including the rise of another top prospect in Gaucho blue and gold, a recovering team leader and much more.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Noah Davis, Noah Davis, Noah Davis: Do not forget the name Noah Davis, especially come spring time. Last season, the Gaucho ace was 7-4 as a sophomore with a 4.63 ERA and 65 strikeouts in 81.2 innings pitched. Although still impressive, even Davis himself would tell you those numbers are not good enough, at least for him.</p>\n<p>Last season is last season though.</p>\n<p>Over the summer in the Cape Cod League, Davis garnered the attention by many, if not all, MLB teams after being named to the Top-25 Prospect List by D1 Baseball. In an intentionally limited five appearances for the Cotuit Kettleers, Davis had an ERA of 2.83 against some of the best hitters in the country. As a result, Davis started on the mound every day in the fall, even in an inter-squad game that was the highly anticipated MLB Scout Day.</p>\n<p>Dozens of scouts were there all fall with their radar guns up and ready, seeing Davis reach speeds of up to 97 mph on his fastball and impressive late-life movement on his slider.</p>\n<p>Even though Davis did show a lot of promise in many inter-squad scrimmages, he would leave his fastball up at times, resulting in many hittable pitches from hungry players trying to get noticed by scouts as well.</p>\n<p>“I would not say I faired too well against our competitive hitters, but I can see the way they compete when I’m on the mound,” Davis said after UCSB’s last fall scrimmage of the year. “I don’t think my game stepped up as much as it needed to or as much as I would like it to. My goal for the fall was to stay healthy the whole way through, which I was able to do. I’ve been working on fastball height too, which has taken a step back in the past two weeks, but I am still feeling I’m headed in the right direction.”</p>\n<p>A huge story last season for the Gauchos was the devastating injury to team leader and shortstop Clay Fisher. After medical red-shirting and recovering from Tommy John surgery on his throwing arm, many worried how Fisher would bounce back.</p>\n<p>Although not yet swinging a bat and not throwing at any point this fall, Fisher was still able to participate in many on-field activities. As always, Fisher was smoother than silk on ice during practice and scrimmages. Offensively, due to his recovery process, he could only work on his bunting game in the box.</p>\n<p>“The only thing I feel like I was limited on was taking live at-bats,” Fisher said. “I’ve been taking ground ball reps, I know I can’t throw, but I feel the same in the field as I was in the past so I think I progressed just as well [as anyone else this fall].”</p>\n<p>Many are speculating and questioning the timetable of Fisher’s return, but Fisher wants to let everyone know everything will be alright.</p>\n<p>“I do think that I’ll be 100 percent. It might not be right at the beginning of the season, but I’m definitely making strides. I feel good and I really don’t have any doubts,” the star shortstop said.</p>\n<p>Besides Clay Fisher, other guys were feeling good and not doubting themselves as well. Sophomore Eric Yang, who only had 30 plate appearances in his freshman season, showed up this fall squaring up the pelota, driving the ball gap to gap and around the entire field.</p>\n<p>If you have been paying attention to Yang this summer, though, this is not really a surprise. Again, Yang was another Gaucho who had a fantastic summer hitting .360 with 27 RBI in 36 games in the Great West League for the Medford Rogues.</p>\n<p>Another player who hit the ball well in the fall was junior Michael McAdoo. McAdoo was finding barrel after barrel after barrel all fall, mashing the ball and crushing homeruns in inter-squad games. Making only spot starts and difficult pitch hitting appearances last season, McAdoo hit .227. However, after this breakout fall, with last season’s left fielder Billy Fredrick graduated, McAdoo is making his case to be the Gauchos’ starting left fielder come spring.</p>\n<p>Even the rookies were a cornerstone to how the fall unfolded.</p>\n<p>After having the No. 9 recruiting class in the nation last season, this year the Gauchos were ranked in the top 25 once again at No. 22 in the country by Baseball America.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, some of the youngbloods showed up to play some ball. Three freshmen who can have a potential impact in the spring are RHP Jason Willow, catcher/RHP Christopher Troye and second baseman Marcos Castanon.</p>\n<p>Willow, the Canadian from Victoria, British Columbia, is a loose, goofy 18-year- old who is slowly proving his worth on the mound but has already proved his worth in the clubhouse, as he has no problem keeping the guys loose. When I asked him what it was like being a Gaucho, the freshman gave a typical Willow answer.</p>\n<p>“It’s a cool feeling. I mean, it’s a long time coming, you know, being here, being part of the team. It’s been great so far,” he explained.</p>\n<p>Troye, on the other hand, is all business, especially when he’s on the mound. The catcher, who will see more time as a converted pitcher this season, hit 95 mph on the bump and sat consistently between 93-95 mph when on the mound.</p>\n<p>While working with pitching coach Matt Harvey, Troye developed a curveball and a late-life slider that proved to be devastating when spots were hit. The only question for this young gun will be consistency in the strike zone and location with pitches come springtime. Regardless, Troye’s live arm has already garnered the attention of some MLB scouts.</p>\n<p>The last of the frosh recruits mentioned is second Castanon. Castanon is likely to start at second this year as a true freshman for one reason: This kid can rake.</p>\n<p>Castanon has ridiculous hand eye-coordination to the point where he almost always finds ways to make contact with the ball. Although defense is still a concern for the young infielder, his bat will help him find a way into the lineup.</p>\n<p>Overall, this fall was convincing as the Gauchos look like an improved squad from last year’s team, purely based on talent and by intensity and focus at practice and during games.</p>\n<p>The main concern coming into the fall was pitching as the Gauchos last season had a team ERA of 5.24 and batting average against of .279.</p>\n<p>Both starting pitching and bullpen arms looked a lot more lively and competitive over last year’s squad, but only time will tell if that will hold true. With the first game coming up faster than many think on Feb. 16 at San Diego State, the Gauchos seem poised to have a better season than last year and may surprise many throughout the game of college baseball.</p>\n<p>Fall baseball, otherwise known as Fall Ball, is arguably one of the toughest times for a college baseball player. Not only are players trying to impress coaches, win jobs, get stronger and become more skilled, but they are also battling hundreds of other students in the classroom as well to stay eligible for the spring season.</p>\n<p>As the fall quarter winds down, so does UCSB baseball. As team activities come to a temporary close, it is easy to conclude that the fall was anything but easy for the players.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80079\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80079\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/ucsb-baseball-fall-recap/","id":4165,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>At first glance, Armani Smith, does not look like a freshman. In fact, he is already built like the big-league prospect that he is. Standing at 6’3” and weighing 195 pounds, the young utility baseball player from De La Salle High School was drafted in the 35th round by the Cleveland Indians before arriving at UCSB.</p>\n<p>In his first year, Smith burst onto the scene for the Gauchos, hitting well for the majority of the season while playing solid defense in the field. At one point, the freshman was batting third with an average north of .350. Although Smith cooled down a bit, the young Gaucho star finished the season hitting .285 with three homeruns, 24 runs batted in and 32 runs.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>But those are just numbers. Smith’s play goes far deeper than what the numbers say. To simply put it, the kid does not get cheated at the plate. With every swing, even when fooled, Smith would let it fly. At times, Smith would swing <em>so</em> hard that even on misses the crowd would “Ooh” and “Ahh” in amazement. The three home runs hit by Smith were not your typical DI home runs, either. Smith would hit one out to deep right center, to deep center <em>on a line</em> and to left field that would clear not only the scoreboard but also the protective net that shields buildings near the stadium. That ball easily soared more than 400 feet, which is scary coming from a freshman. The kid has serious pop.</p>\n<p>What was even more impressive than his tools, though, was how selfless he was for his team. Smith would rover from right field, to left field to second base while moving around in the line-up all season long. Now, this may not sound like a big deal, but playing several positions while being moved around the line-up is one of the most uncomfortable things for a player to do, but Smith made it look easy. Without a doubt, for all his efforts, Armani Smith deserves to be the <em>Nexus</em> Sports Male Freshman of the Year.</p>\n<p><strong>Lindsey Ruddins (W Volleyball) by Omar Hernandez</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78325\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78325\" data-attachment-id=\"78325\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/lindsey-ruddins-soars-through-the-air-while-serving-dustin-harrisdaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/WVball_vsLBSU-161021-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lindsey Ruddins soars through the air while serving.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Lindsey Ruddins had one of the most dominant individual seasons of any athlete at UCSB this year. The redshirt freshman from Laguna Niguel was a scourge on the offensive end, earning the Big West Freshman of the Year award, which hadn’t been awarded to a Gaucho volleyball player since 2012.</p>\n<p>She received a host of other accolades as well, making both the All-Big West and All-Freshman teams along with notching five Freshman of the Week awards.</p>\n<p>On a national level, Ruddins became the first Gaucho since 2012 to be named to the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) All-American team as an honorable mention, and she also earned honorable mention honors on the AVCA All-Pacific South Region team.</p>\n<p>The year Ruddins had would be considered extraordinary for any player, much less a freshman. To be third in the conference in both kills per set (4.09) and total kills (389) and then sixth in the conference in service aces per set (.31) was no coincidence.</p>\n<p>It shows only the dedication that Ruddins put into practice (redshirting her whole first year to hone her skills) but also her ability to translate what she has learned into an enormous impact on the court.</p>\n<p>UCSB improved by five wins this season, and a lot of that improvement has to do with Ruddins’s exceptional year. Both she and the team have a lot of room to grow; the Gauchos have never made it to the final four of the NCAA tournament, and she still has three years to work on her game. If this year is any indication, however, we could be looking at one of the best talents to ever play for UCSB and a potential NCAA champion as well.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 8 of the June 8, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78419\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78419\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-welcome-to-the-next-level-armani-smith-lindsey-ruddins-named-nexus-freshmen-of-the-year/","id":1885,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

Sunday was the first time Fullerton ace Eastman has thrown since February 21<sup>st</sup> in a start against UNLV.  Eastman pitched well enough, but the Titan hurler did show some rust.  Being on an understandably short leash, Eastman would throw 2.2 innings giving up two hits, one earned run, while walking two.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The young UCSB right-hander, Lincoln, had control issues Sunday afternoon. Lincoln would also go 2.2 innings, but not because of a short leash. The pitch count rose quickly for Lincoln as he could not find the zone. The stuff was there showing a 90 to 91 mph fastball and good movement on both his slider and changeup, but most pitches would miss low or in the dirt.</p>\n<p>Lincoln would be a part of a rough third inning that would be a huge part in deciding the game early in favor of the home team. After getting two out in the bottom of the third, Lincoln would give up a dead-center two-run shot to Titan first baseman Taylor Bryant. After walking Timmy Richards, the Gauchos would go to their bullpen early.</p>\n<p>RHP Steven Ledesma, who has been lights out as of late before coming into Sunday’s matchup, was put in. After throwing 1.1 innings Friday and .2 innings Saturday, the transfer junior from Santa Barbara City College was noticeably tired while warming up only hovering around 85 to 86 mph with his fastball, a mark 2 to 3 mph lower than usual for the righty.</p>\n<p>As a result of fatigue, Ledesma got teed off on. Hunter Cullen would hit a bases-clearing triple to left center scoring two. The next batter Chris Hudgins would continue with a two-run shot to left field scoring two more.</p>\n<p>After a Chris Prescott single, Scott Hurst would hit <em>another </em>home run to right field adding yet two more runs for the Titans. Ledesma would not last the inning after giving up six runs from five batters. Ben Brecht would come in and finish the inning one batter later. The Titans would score eight two-out runs via a triple and three home runs in the bottom of the 3<sup>rd</sup>.</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Gauchos would score three runs, but had opportunity after opportunity to score and make the game interesting. UCSB bats would leave the bases loaded scoring no runs on two separate occasions with one out. Even worse, the Gauchos were 0 for 5 with runners on 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> in the game. Although Kenny Corey would go 3 for 4, he would never be up with runners in scoring position resulting in no RBIS for the Gaucho 3<sup>rd</sup> baseman.</p>\n<p>Two more home runs and a triple would come again later in the game for the Titans resulting in the final score of 12 to 3. In total, even though collecting 14 hits, all runs produced for the Titans came on the five home runs and two triples given up. In the route, Lincoln (1-3) would get the loss.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will try to move on from the beat down and face the Trojans at the USC Wednesday night at 6 p.m. With using five arms including the usual midweek starter in Brecht Sunday, it will be interesting to see who the Gauchos will have left to throw considering a big Cal Poly series on the horizon at the end of the week.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-14/3rd-inning-blues-gauchos-give-up-8-runs-in-3rd-inning-lose-4th-conference-rubber-match-of-the-season/","id":4114,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

After coming off a College World Series campaign, the pain of another school within your own conference potentially being able to experience the same thing you did last year is a deep one, especially if you’re one of the returners. To compensate, the Gauchos will be fired up while going into enemy territory to take on the No. 15 team in the country.</p>\n<p><strong>2) UCSB Baseball has a lot of pride on the line.</strong></p>\n<p>Head Coach Andrew Checketts and his coaching staff will not be playing around with their lineup during this series as we have seen lately. Expect to see a lineup similar to what we have seen all year long. Guys on the DL, such as junior second baseman Colton Burns and sophomore ace Noah Davis, might make an appearance knowing that this series can give momentum to the team heading into next year. As much as coaches and players will tell you until they’re blue in the face about how last year’s series don’t matter, they do and people remember.</p>\n<p><strong>3) The ‘Chos have an opportunity to play spoiler.</strong></p>\n<p>As it stands, the Titans are second place in the Big West Conference with a 10-5 conference record on the tail of Long Beach State. On top of this, Cal Poly is only one game behind Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have the fun opportunity to ruin a potential region bid for CSF and play spoiler. If UCSB wins the series, Cal Poly can take its spot in second while Long Beach State can run away with the conference. This would be a monumental blow, considering Cal State Fullerton was once ranked as high as No. 4 in the nation after beating some competitive teams poised to contend deep into the season.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Friday, the projected starter for the Gauchos is junior left-handed pitcher Kyle Nelson. Nelson’s last outing against UC Davis was fantastic; he got the win, going nine full innings while giving up three earned runs and striking out six in the process.</p>\n<p>Nelson will square off against the Titans’ junior ace Connor Seabold. Seabold is 7-4 on the year with a 2.81 ERA.  In the righty’s last start, Seabold got the win at Hawaii, pitching eight innings, giving up one earned run and striking out seven.</p>\n<p>The series will continue the next day, during which Noah Davis is expected to return to the rotation. The sophomore has been out for a couple of weeks with an undisclosed injury, but in his last outing on April 21 against San Diego State, Davis pitched impressively, going 7.1 innings with one earned run and six strikeouts.</p>\n<p>His anticipated competition is CSUF’s John Gavin, a lefty with a 5-2 record and 3.33 ERA. Gavin’s last outing was also against Hawaii, but the junior Titan lost the decision, pitching six innings and giving up four earned runs to the Rainbow Warriors. However, the lefty did strike out eight.</p>\n<p>Make sure to tune in to watch some of the best baseballs the Gauchos will face this season. In many ways, this series will be a benchmark for what’s to come from the team moving forward, as many players are expected to return next season.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77787\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77787\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/lights-anthem-action-ucsb-goes-to-cal-st-fullerton-for-big-weekend-series/","id":4260,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

In the first game of the day, RHP Chris Clements pitched phenomenally for UCSB.  Clements would do a fantastic job establishing pitches on the inside part of the plate to the primarily right-handed hitting line-up. Through the first five, Clements was cruising.</p>\n<p>As heartless baseball is sometimes, his hard work through those innings would be somewhat tarnished with a rough top of the sixth.  Still, although giving up four consecutive two out hits to Aggie hitters that would allow three earned runs, Clements stuff and command wise looked the best it has been in a while.</p>\n<p>In the sixth, the Aggie hitters caught on to the first pitch fastball pattern Clements was falling into and took advantage of it.  Clements would eventually get the loss by giving up three earned runs off nine hits, but would finish with six innings pitched while striking out five. Without that last inning, Clements would have pitched a gem.</p>\n<p>In the second game, true freshman Chris Lincoln looked like a future Gaucho ace after settling down from a shaky third inning in which he gave up two runs. The former 13<sup>th</sup> round pick for the Cleveland Indians in last year’s draft, had scary big league stuff on the mound. Lincoln’s fastball was electric as usually, but his slider and change up were simply something to truly marvel at.</p>\n<p>The only thing holding the 6’4, 175 lb. freshman back are control issues with the fastball and slider. Lincoln’s stuff plays so well at a Division 1 level though, that on days where he does not have his control, he is still dominant which he let all see Saturday in his start. Lincoln would have his longest outing of the season in his second start Saturday, going five IP, with six Ks and two ER.</p>\n<p>Another thing to not ignore, the bullpen did a great job shutting down UC Davis as well. In the double header, bullpen relief threw seven innings of scoreless baseball. Stephen Ledesma had one inning that could have been a disaster, but he kept his composure and got out of the jam. Ledesma would do more than asked by striking out four through three innings only giving up one hit.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side, Sam Cohen was the bright spot in game one of the double header. Although going 0 for 3 in the second game, Cohen would go 2 for 2 with a majestic, high towering solo shot to right in game one of the double header, game two of the series. Cohen now has seven homers on the year.</p>\n<p>Now the negative: without sugar coating it, the Gauchos simply could not hit Saturday in both contests. The UCSB Offense has been strong through the majority of the season, with having an impressive .278 team batting average (2<sup>nd</sup> best in the Big West Conference) coming into yesterday’s double-header.</p>\n<p>Still, with the offense doing as well as it has been, UCSB bats did not show up.  Due to an abandonment of their opposite-field, watch the off-speed deep approach, the Gaucho bats were sat down all day long. When the ball was hit the other way, it was weakly hit which is something not seen to often from UCSB.</p>\n<p>UC Davis starters, RHP Justin Mullins and LHP Robert Garcia pecked away on the outside part of the plate all day long to UCSB with great control. Gaucho hitters could not make the adjustment though. Against Mullins in the first game of the double header, the Gauchos would strike out four times while collecting six hits, all singles but the Sam Cohen home run. Mullins final bylines would be 6.2 IP, 5 H, 1 ER, 3 BB while improving to 2-3 on the year.</p>\n<p>Lefty Garcia, who is a candidate for Big West Pitcher of the Week, threw a complete game shutout while striking out 11 UCSB batters. Even though UCSB Head Coach Andrew Checketts threw in a righty line up to face the lefty, the Gauchos could not figure out the Aggie game two starter. Garcia’s off-speed had sliding movement with 12 to 6 action, which, when paired with pinpoint fastball control, had Gauchos guessing, lunging, and out in front all game long. Garcia, now 2-5 this season, only gave up two hits to Gauchos.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the double header, Coach Checketts commented on the day. “It looked like it wasn’t going to be an easy day to hit from the get go. The wind was howling in, unless you hit it in that kind of window in right field, it had a chance to blow.”</p>\n<p>On Garcia, Checketts tipped his cap. “I think their guy did a nice job and we didn’t do a good job enough of adjusting.” Checketts continued, “Their guy (Garcia) filled up the strike zone the second game. We had some chances but really couldn’t deliver any kind of blow, but our pitchers did a nice job of keeping us in there.”</p>\n<p>After this series loss, UCSB baseball is 6-9 in the Big West conference. Officially, the Gauchos will not have a chance to make a run for another run for a college World Series appearance. Although the 2017 season has been a disappointing one for Santa Barbara baseball fans, the future does look bright for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Freshman stars such as Armani Smith, Tommy Jew, Shea Barry, and Chris Lincoln have shown sky high potential this year. Moving forward, expect Andrew Checketts to start experimenting more with younger players and the line up to see where guys will fit next season.</p>\n<p>UCSB baseball now has just 12 games left on the schedule: eight away games, four home games.

Given the ball on the rubber Sunday, the freshman, who previously had 14 appearances out of the pen this year for the Gauchos, went 3.2 innings pitched giving up two earned runs off four hits.</p>\n<p>Those two runs came off of two solo shots in the bottom of the second off the bats of DH Connor Cannon and second baseman Cody Sporrer. After giving up the long bombs, the young righty would go 1.2 more innings striking out three more batters. In all Lincoln would punchout six UCR batters.</p>\n<p>Offensively, UC Santa Barbara would get things up and going in the top of the third with a sacrifice fly off the bat of centerfielder Tommy Jew scoring Dempsey Grover. In the fourth, the Gauchos would have there almost ceremonial big inning, scoring three runs.</p>\n<p>Getting his first start of the season Sunday, Junior Kyle Plantier would take advantage of his given opportunity by going big fly ya-ya to left center where the big boys live to put the Gauchos ahead. Plantier would collect his first and second RBI on the two-run homer. Following the two-run tater, newly put in relief pitcher Matt Hardy would throw a wild pitch allowing Dempsey Grover to score.</p>\n<p>One more run would be added in the sixth off a Dempsey Grover solo home run. Grover, the Gauchos everyday man behind the dish, would have a day going 3 for 4 while scoring three runs for UCSB. Grover, a Johnny Bench Award candidate, is now hitting .286 with four home runs and 13 RBI after today’s performance.</p>\n<p>Eventually, UCR would find its way into UCSB’s bullpen. After a shutout relief performance from Kevin Chandler, usual Sunday starter Ben Brecht would take the mound. The gentle freshman giant would throw well going 1.1 innings pitched in his first bullpen appearance of the year, but would allow one earned run in the seventh off a single through the right side off the bat of Mark Contreras.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the eighth, things would get interesting. As if suddenly taking plays out of the San Francisco Giants playbook, the bullpen would start to get rocky. Righty Steven Ledesma would be the next guy on the bump for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After allowing two runners on, Ledesma would give up a two-RBII single to Cody Sporrer to left field. Sporrer faired well against Gaucho pitching himself Sunday going 2 for 4 with 3 RBI. Ledesma would get the second out of the inning via fly out to right, but that would be the end of Ledesma’s day. Closer Shea Barry would come in to finish the inning.</p>\n<p>Now with the game tied up by a score of 5 to 5 in the ninth, Tommy Jew would lead off the inning with a triple to left-center field. Eventually getting runners on second and third with one down, Kenny Corey would hit a deep fly ball to centerfield scoring the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly. The inning would soon end short after.</p>\n<p>Barry still on the mound, the Gauchos would need three more out to put away the Highlanders. To lead off the inning AJ Sawyer would hit a bullet into right centerfield. However, Tommy Jew would be there to sell out for his team. Snaring the lined shot in the gap, Jew would lay out, getting parallel to the ground while snow-coning a ball in his glove. Jew would not only have the play of the game on offense but would make the play of the game, maybe even of the year on defense as well.</p>\n<p>Barry would close the door for the Gauchos getting Mark Contreras to strike out and Michael Farris to end the game on a groundout to shortstop JJ Muno. Barry would get the win for the ‘Chos improving his record to 1-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, although improving their record, are still at 5-7 in the conference. UCSB still has a lot of ground to make up if they want a shot at regionals. With its RPI sitting at the high 100’s, a chance at a Regional seems small unless Santa Barbara can get the automatic bid by winning its conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will begin a three-game set at home against the UC Davis Aggies next Friday at 3 p.m. The Gauchos will need a sweep of the series if they hope to keep their playoff hopes alive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77484\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77484\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-01/gauchos-avoid-sweep-at-ucr-with-6-5-sunday-win/","id":4258,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

After going seven Innings pitched in his last start against Pepperdine, Brecht would only go four innings against the Roadrunners giving up six hits and four earned runs altogether for a no decision in the contest.</p>\n<p>The true freshman was shaken up early on in the first inning after giving up a leadoff double and two more base hits, which would lead to two runs off the young lefty.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Brecht, who had decent stuff in his outing, would come out for a much needed 1-2-3 frame before giving up one more run off a sacrifice fly from the second baseman David Metzgar in the third frame. In the fourth, senior shortstop Ryan Grotjohn would lead off the inning with a hustle double on a bloop to left field. Despite this, Brecht held the Roadrunners to one run, making the score 4-0 after the top half of the frame.</p>\n<p>Even though this was not the start the Gauchos wanted from their young pitcher, the bats would pick up Brecht their young pitcher. In the bottom of the fourth, the Gauchos would finally get to Bakersfield own freshman pitcher Mathew Seibert.</p>\n<p>With one out in the inning, the sixth hole hitter senior outfielder Billy Fredrick would get things going with a perfectly back-spun base-hit line drive to centerfield. Next, freshman outfielder Armani Smith would single up the middle right after Fredrick to knock out the right-handed Seibert. The reliever turned starter for the day would have a predictable short outing going only 3.1 IP with no strikeouts and giving up two earned runs.</p>\n<p>However, even his relief pitcher, freshman Kenny Johnson could not stop UCSB from its big inning. JJ Muno would find barrel, singling through the left side. With back to back to back hits, the Gauchos had the bases loaded with only one out.</p>\n<p>Eric Yang, the freshman catcher had the table set for his first collegiate hit to be a big one. Yang, although not getting a hit, would still get the job done hitting a high chopper to third not allowing a double play or a throw home to get the force out. The freshman catcher would get thrown out at first but a run would score.</p>\n<p>The most clutch at bat of the day though would come next in the form of Colton Burns. The junior second baseman would come through with a two out double roped into the left center gap scoring both Smith and Muno making the score 4-3 through four complete.</p>\n<p>In relief for Brecht, the true freshman righty Chris Lincoln would come in with some swagger to sit down Roadrunner batters. The pitcher who models his game after the late Yodano Ventura, came in and let it be known to the Gaucho coaching staff that they can have some faith in their youthful bullpen after a couple shaky outings.</p>\n<p>Lincoln had his A+ stuff, wooing the crowd with his electric fastball and Wiffle ball-esque slider. The lengthy righty with an impressive pitcher’s build would go 3.1 IP giving up only two hits with as many strikeouts. Moving forward, especially after this outing, Lincoln could be a potential starter in future years for the Chos.</p>\n<p>To back up a dominant bullpen performance from Lincoln, the Gauchos would continue to score runs as the game went on.  During the sixth, reliever Malik Jones who oddly enough DH’d for Bakersfield in the game as well, balked in a run, scoring Armani Smith.</p>\n<p>In the seventh though Austin “Big Daddy” Bush would make people understand why his nickname is “Big Daddy.”  The Gaucho four hitter would hit a ball, not only over the first fence in right field, but over a second set of fences protecting transformers as well for a solo homerun. To simply put it, Bush didn’t just get a piece of it; he got the whole thing and disgraced the Ball’s entire family with one swing. The statement making go ahead home run from Bush would completely deflate the CSUB dugout and put all the air into the sails of UCSB.</p>\n<p>JJ Muno would score the last run of the game for the Chos, giving a huge insurance run for UCSB. After a walk, Muno would wreak havoc on the base paths. With the offensive mindset of run-until-they-tag-ya, Muno would steal second and then steal third.  While stealing third the throw from Bakersfield catcher Jake Oliver would short hop third baseman Brandon Heinrich and shoot into left field. Muno would score easy and manufacture a run in the most Pete Rose way possible.</p>\n<p>With a two run lead, Shea Barry would come in to close it out for the Chos and had little trouble. Barry would continue to show why he is the most accountable pitcher to call on out of the pin by ending the game with a big strike out with a runner scoring position.  The righty would collect his third save of the year and lower his team leading ERA to 2.53. The final score: 6 to 4 UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are now 14-9 at home this season. With a quality comeback win against a solid Bakersfield squad.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will have some momentum heading to UC Riverside for a three game weekend conference series starting Friday night at 6 p.m. Both Friday’s and Saturday’s matchups will be aired and available on ESPN 3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/ucsb-bests-csub-6-4-in-midweek-home-victory/","id":4128,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

Hiura’s Big West best batting average would improve to .405.</p>\n<p>Kyle Nelson, the starter for the Gauchos Saturday, recovered well after giving up the triple to Hiura. He would lock back in and pitch three scoreless innings for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Nelson, who gave up three home runs in his last start, pitched fantastic this time around, going six innings and giving up only one earned run while striking out five.</p>\n<p>Gaucho bats picked up right where they left off from game one and continued to tee off on Anteater pitching. After scoring two runs in the 4th, UCSB would plate five more runs in the 6th. Per usual, the Gauchos would cash in on one big inning: on five hits, five runs would score.</p>\n<p>Louis Raymond, the Irvine starter, in 5.2 innings gave up five earned runs on nine hits to the Chos.</p>\n<p>Armani Smith, Tommy Jew, and Kenny Corey had the best day at the plate for the Chos. Smith went 2 for 5 with a double while touching home twice for UCSB. Jew would also have a multi-hit game, going 2 for 4 on top of cashing in a run with a knock up the middle in the 6th.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho 3rd baseman Corey hit a ball past the diving shortstop Mikey Duarte in the 4th to score the first two runs for the Chos. Corey, who was 1 for 3, was also a centerpiece in a big play for UCSB.</p>\n<p>In the 6th, Corey would lay down a sacrifice bunt down in front of home plate. Anteater catcher Alex Guenette would airmail the throw to first and allow Armani Smith to score while Corey hustled around the bases eventually making it to 3rd on the throwing error.</p>\n<p>With all that run support and a more than solid outing from their starter Nelson, the Gauchos bullpen would dampen a beautiful day at the yard by giving up a five-run lead.</p>\n<p>Kevin Chandler would first come in to relieve Nelson in the 7th. Chandler would have control issues walking one batter and leaving the ball up to three more allowing three hits which would score 2 runs for Irvine.</p>\n<p>Next, Steven Ledesma would come in to relieve Chandler in the 7th. With two outs, Ledesma got the job done and limited the damage by striking out Alex Guenette.</p>\n<p>The very next inning though, Ledesma could only get one out. After an Adrian Damla single and a Dailin Lee walk, Ryan Johnston would hit a ball to Gaucho shortstop JJ Muno.</p>\n<p>The ball would hit off Muno’s glove and roll into left field scoring Damla. After the error, Head Coach Andrew Checketts would remove Ledesma and bring in freshman Chris Lincoln.</p>\n<p>A few batters later, Mikey Duarte, the Irvine shortstop, would single to right-center scoring Lee. Both runs would not be charged to Ledesma, but regardless the damage was done.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who at one point lead the game by a score of 7 to 2, headed to the top of the 9th barely hanging to a score of 7 to 6.  Chris Lincoln would come out to try to get the final 3 outs for the Chos.</p>\n<p>Lincoln would start off the inning by hitting the Irvine pinch hitter Matt Reitano with a fastball on a 3-2 count. Next, Anteater 2nd baseman Cole Kreuter would single through the left side.</p>\n<p>After a poor bunt by Adrian Damla that would move the runner to 3rd, but get the runner out at 2nd, Dallin Lee would hit a ball to the Gaucho shortstop JJ Muno. Muno trying to end the game on a double play threw the ball out of the reach for the second baseman Colton Burns.</p>\n<p>The ball would roll to the right field corner, scoring one run for the Anteaters. With this error from Muno, UC Irvine completed the 5 run comeback in the 9th.</p>\n<p>Runners on the corners after the error from Muno, Devin Pettengill hit a ball deep enough to left to score Adrian Damla on a sacrifice fly. From this, Anteaters took the lead 8 to 7.</p>\n<p>In the bottom of the 9th, the Gauchos would not do much after a Colton Burns single to lead off the inning and a Billy Fredrick sacrifice bunt.</p>\n<p>Austin Bush would fly out to left field and for the final out Armani Smith would strike out swinging.  UC Irvine closer Calvin Faucher would record his Big West-leading 9th save of the season.</p>\n<p>“I think when you’re up 7 to 2, you should be able to overcome that with pitching. In my mind, we should overcome those. If we turn that double play with JJ (Muno) I think we might still be playing. It might be still a tie game. But again, I don’t think we did well out of the bullpen.” Coach Checketts continued, “I don’t want to throw any kids under the bus, you know, (the coaching staff and I) are responsible for it. We got to figure out who to throw out there in those situations.”</p>\n<p>So far this year, the Gauchos have had a rubber match game in each one of their conference series but the team has been unable to win one. Let’s see what Saturday has in store for both of these teams trying to turn around their season.</p>\n<p>Saturday, the Gauchos will take on the Anteaters for yet another rubber match conference game at 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 15th at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-14/ucsb-blows-five-run-lead-in-8-7-loss-to-uci/","id":4124,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

More runs would be scored for the Gauchos in the second and third innings from an Armani Smith double play ball that would still plate Kenny Corey and a Billy Fredrick RBI single to the right that would score Dempsey Grover.</p>\n<p>Although the ‘Chos had a three run lead early on, CSUN would fight back. After cruising through three innings, UCSB redshirt sophomore pitcher Chris Clements would run into trouble in the bottom of the 4<sup>th</sup> giving up three runs. After a single that lead to an error in centerfield by Fredrick, the righty would give up another hit to the Matador junior catcher Albee Weiss that would plate CSUN’s first run of the game. After a walk and sacrifice bunt, Weiss would score by a sacrifice fly from Fred Smith. The equalizing run came next from Matador junior right fielder Nick Sablock, who smoked an RBI double down the right field line. After two back-to-back fantastic outings from the Gaucho junior Chris Clements, his day would end abruptly going 3.2 innings pitched, giving up three hits and three earned runs.</p>\n<p>After a quiet fifth inning, the Gauchos and Matadors would go toe-to-toe, almost matching blow for blow in this backyard brawl.</p>\n<p>To begin the sixth, both Kenny Corey and JJ Muno would lead off the inning with back-to-back singles for the Chos. Next, trust freshman Armani Smith, who has been a big piece in the offensive resurrection for UCSB, continued raking with a single to left that would score Corey. The next batter, Tommy Jew, would make up for his error in center and would go three run big fly to left giving the Gauchos a sizeable 7 to 3 lead.</p>\n<p>But after taking some blows, the Matadors would come right back at the Chos. Nolan Bumsteed would hit a double to center to lead off the inning, followed by another Matador reaching on an error by JJ Muno. Fred Smith would hit his 2<sup>nd</sup> sacrifice fly of the game, scoring Bumstead. Moments later, Nick Sablock would continue having a game as he would send a ball over the right field wall for a two run see-you-later.</p>\n<p>The very next inning, Gaucho DH Sam Cohen, the Louisville Slugger, would launch one over the right field wall continuing the mortar barrage over the fences of Matador Field. With an 8 to 6 lead and a fresh bullpen everything was looking well for UCSB heading into the last two innings.</p>\n<p>Coming in to relieve Kevin Chandler was the local kid Steve Ledesma who pitched fantastic in two innings.  Then came the 9<sup>th</sup> for Ledesma. The righty from Ventura, California would get two quick outs after allowing a single and a sacrifice fly. The rest would be history though when Ledesma would leave up a 1-1 slider, giving up the big three-run walk off shot to Bumstead. Ledesma (2-4), after pitching fantastic, would pay for his one mistake.</p>\n<p>In order to make regionals, the Gauchos will have to win every series and most single play games for the rest of the season to improve their RPI by a sizeable amount. The Gauchos surely have the talent to do so, but it seems when one aspect of the team is doing well, the other side of the ball is not doing so hot. If the Gauchos finally do click, they’ll need to go on a historic streak to keep the dream of another College World Series run a live.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have a chance to turn the page Tuesday, April 11 when they host the University of Nevada, Reno at 3 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76828\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/gauchos-fall-to-matadors-in-series-rubber-match/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76828\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/gauchos-fall-to-matadors-in-series-rubber-match/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/gauchos-fall-to-matadors-in-series-rubber-match/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/gauchos-fall-to-matadors-in-series-rubber-match/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/gauchos-fall-to-matadors-in-series-rubber-match/","id":4218,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

As stated before, hitting is contagious, and this group of guys could not have picked a better time to catch this fever as they head into conference.</p>\n<p>On top of a firing-on-all-cylinders offense, UCSB’s starters have been pitching with authority as well. Besides a rough outing from ace Noah Davis last weekend, starters Kyle Nelson, Chris Clements, and Ben Bretch are coming off their best outings of the year as they head into the series against the Dirt Bags.</p>\n<p>The only real concern is in every one of the great performances each ace threw their highest pitch counts of the season and went later into games than ever before.  Regardless, UCSB has all the momentum of both sides of the ball going into this series, which could turn out to be a difference maker throughout Big West play this year.</p>\n<p>However, the month of March was not all smiles for UCSB. The Gauchos will need to replace the productivity of the great junior shortstop Clay Fisher who is out for the year after undergoing Tommy John Surgery, and previous Sunday ace starter Joe Record.</p>\n<p>Despite the home team hosting this series with a ton of momentum on its side, Long Beach State is certainly has been producing as of late as well.

In fact, Long Beach St. has several things actually working against them this weekend that others might not see.</p>\n<p>During their past 10 games, five of LBSU’s eight wins have come from very close games with scores within at least two runs of each other. Each of these five wins could have gone either way, but to the Dirtbags credit, they know how to win close games with their entire team.</p>\n<p>Nobody in particular has been amazing. Regardless, the big three hitters to watch out for are Ramsey Romano (.360, 1 HR, 14 RBI), Lucas Tancas (.347, 2 HR, 11 RBI), and David Banueios (.312, 4 HR, 17 RBI) as these guys have been consistent all season long for the most part.</p>\n<p>For their starters, only one has an ERA below 4, which belongs to Junior RHP Darren McCaughan (3.48 ERA, 41.1 IP, 16 ER, 5 HR, 37 SO). The Dirt Bag’s pitching overall has been less than impressive.</p>\n<p>The away record for the Dirt Bags is something to be weary of as well. Long Beach is 5-9 on the road this year, while the Gauchos have held an impressive record at home of 8-3.</p>\n<p>But how about this, the most impactful part of this weekend’s matchup might not even have anything to do with the Gauchos. The Dirtbags have played a total of five games in five days. When they play UCSB? Well, that will be six games in six days. By the end of the series, Long Beach St. will have played eight games in eight days. Without a doubt, the Dirt Bags will be playing tired baseball. Their pitching staff is already heavily used up before this series even begins and their position players will be on heavy legs on defense and in the box.

The club goers were rowdy and ready for Joyzu to play their set. Many were there because they were familiar with the duo’s name but weren’t sure how they would perform live. As the two small-town kids took over the reins, a Joyzu remix of “We Will Rock You” by Queen started to play. With heavy themes centered around trap styles, the build up to the song established high-tension energy in the room. Suddenly, the carbon dioxide cannons filled with cold air fired off on the dance floor as the drop hit. The lights, lasers and specially made Joyzu graphics danced and supplemented the beat and drops in breathtaking fashion: they came to rock the people of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joyzu, an EDM music group from the small town of El Dorado Hills, Calif., features two young producers, Carson Willms and Quinton Pope. At the respective ages of 22 and 21 years old, the two small-town kids have already built an impressive résumé that is making big-city crowds take notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After releasing their hit single “Hear You Say,” the group gained momentum, even garnering major-label attention. Willms and Pope, as you know now, are not your typical college DJs, but are your common college students. Willms and Pope attend college, work jobs, occasionally talk to girls and are busy making their way through the EDM music scene.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been best friends ever since middle school, but got into dance music around the beginning of high school,” Willms and Pope said in a joint interview.  “We fell in love with the genre so much that is pushed us to pursue production and DJing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The love and passion they share for the music definitely shows in their product. While witnessing Joyzu play live at M8TRX nightclub, the one thing that stood out most was the joy they shared on stage, which their stage name aptly foreshadows. The duo danced around on stage, head banged and threw their hands up and down as epic beats dropped on their audience in epic fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Joyzu had so much fun with their music, the crowd responded with relentless energy. Of course the music itself was incredible, but the true difference was the distinct feel in the crowd once Joyzu took the stage and started playing.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are many inspirations that inspire us to keep pursuing music. One being our favorite artists that we look up to who continue to push boundaries, such as Porter Robinson, Skrillex, Zeds Dead, What so Not, Chance the Rapper and Childish Gambino, just to name a few,” they said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of their artistic influences can be heard in their music. Still, the music Joyzu produces maintains a unique sound that must be heard to fully understand. As someone who admittedly does not listen to much EDM music, their music can best be described as high energy, with amazing drops that are not too over the top — a nice change of pace from the music of most electronic duos.

The music itself, let alone the incredibly fun atmosphere the two producers create, will leave you wondering how these guys get paid to have this much fun.

The Gauchos only have 11 doubles and zero triples, both bottom numbers in the Big West. However, the Gauchos are tied with Cal State University Northridge for second for most home runs in the Big West with seven. With these seven home runs, though, UCSB has only managed to score a total of 41 runs, 14 of which came in one game against Tulane on Feb. 25.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although these numbers are worrisome, it is important to note how early it is in the season. People forget this is still “Spring Training” for some college hitters.<br>\nAs more and more hitters find their rhythm and timing, the ’Chos will string together some great at-bats at a more consistent basis. After all, hits do come in bunches, and hitting is contagious.</p>\n<p>The Cougars’ pitching staff will provide a tough challenge for Gaucho hitters to get out of this slump, though. Cougar pitching has a pretty solid team ERA of 3.46, giving up only 35 earned runs total in ten games. With UCSB having a predominately lefty lineup, the six left-handed pitchers featured on the BYU roster will also give the Gauchos some trouble.</p>\n<p>The predicted starters that the Gauchos will face in this four-game series are RHPs senior Brady Coreless (2-0), junior Maverik Buffo (1-2), senior Kendall Motes (0-1) and potentially LHP junior Hayden Rogers (0-0). Coreless is the Cougar ace who owns an impressive 1.89 ERA with 23 strikeouts through 19.0 innings pitched.<br>\nThe other two right-handed starters, Buffo and Motes, have had much rougher outings recently as their respective ERAs of 4.50 and 5.14 show. Lefty Rogers will be tough if he gets his second start of the season. Rogers holds a 2.38 ERA with 11.1 innings and six strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The Cougar offense is also something not to glance over. Coming into the series, BYU will have five different hitters hitting above the .300 mark. Currently leading the Cougar offense is sophomore right fielder Brock Hale. Hale is hitting for both average and power with a .385 average, three doubles and two home runs on top of driving in nine runs.     Even though this offense looks strong on paper, they will face an even stronger Gaucho pitching staff.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s pitching staff has been the most reliable part of this year’s team. Sophomore starters Noah Davis (2-1) and junior Kyle Nelson (1-2) have been pitching exceptionally well with ERAs of 2.14 and 3.14. Still the third and fourth spots in the rotation are up for grabs.</p>\n<p>Redshirt junior Joe Record (0-1, 9.1 IP, 5.79 ERA), the typical Sunday starter for the ’Chos, was moved to the bullpen last week after having a couple rough outings. Junior Steven Ledesma (0-1 10.1, 5.23 ERA) was given the ball instead for his first ever start, but even after pitching impressively in the Gaucho bullpen, Ledesma was rocked, giving up five earned runs in 1.2 innings pitched.</p>\n<p>Junior RHP Chris Clements (0-2, 11.1 IP, 3.18 ERA) is currently in position to take this third spot in the rotation with a decent outing against Saint Mary’s his last start, giving up only two earned runs.</p>\n<p>Still, either Record or Ledesma will make a start this weekend for the Gauchos with the four-game series.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how the Gauchos pitch, it will all come down to offense at the end of the series. UCSB will need to get runners on base and execute their signature West Coast Style Small Ball offense to get runs on the board. Aforementioned, if the Gauchos can string together a couple of good at-bats, an offensive fire could spark to the likes that we have already seen this year in the Tulane series.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the March 9, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76269\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76269\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/gauchos-hope-to-outpace-cougar-pack-while-on-the-road-in-utah/","id":4145,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

Sophomore Wildcat Hjelle matched up with Davis, going seven-and-one-third innings pitched allowing one run off six hits on top of striking out eight Gauchos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of limited offense from Gaucho bats, the two runs given up by Davis was all that was needed for the Wildcats to win. The Gauchos dropped the first game of the series 2-to-1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In game two of the series, another close battle took place. On the mound for this game for the Gauchos was lefty Kyle Nelson (2-1). Nelson, who is making the adjustment from closer to starter, went five-and-one-third innings giving up three runs off six hits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although pitching great through five, in the bottom of the 6th, Nelson gave up a two-run shot to Wildcat second baseman Riley Mahan that cleared the right center wall at Cliff Hagan Stadium. After giving up a double and walking one more, Nelson was taken out of the game. Joe Record and AJ Woodall came in giving only one hit combined through three scoreless innings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the offensive side, in true Gaucho fashion, the ‘Chos showed late life in the top of the 9th scoring two runs off a sac fly from Sam Cohen and a RBI doubles from Armani Smith down the left field line. With two outs and Smith on third (advanced on a wild pitch), Thomas Rowan, the walk-off hero in the Tulane series, went down swinging, ending the game and the late run for the ‘Chos. The score of game two would be 3-to-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the final game, the ‘Chos sent out junior RHP Steven Ledesma for his first ever career college start. The hometown kid from Ventura was pitching extremely well coming into this series in a long relief spot for UCSB. Down in the Deep South, the results would be different, though. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ledesma pitched one-and-two-thirds innings, giving up five earned runs off only two hits. After only giving up a home run to Wildcat first baseman Evan White in the first, the new starter struggled in the 2nd inning walking two, hitting one, and allowing a single that allowed two runs to score. Kevin Chandler came in for relief for Ledesma and gave up back-to-back singles allowing two more of Ledesma’s base runners to score. Even though Ledesma struggled in his first start, expect the righty to bounce back, whether starting again or back in his long relief role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With eight different Gaucho pitchers entering the game, Johnny Wholestaff would give up a total of 12 runs (nine earned) off 13 hits.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kentucky RHP Justin Lewis had a complete opposite outing than Ledesma. The Wildcat sophomore would throw seven perfect innings before giving up a home run to Austin Bush in the top of the eighth. With one swing of the bat, Bush would break up the perfect game, no-hitter, and shutout. In a game to forget for the Gauchos, the final score would be 12-1. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After being swept, the Gauchos extend their losing streak to four games.  Now, the Gauchos look ahead to a three-game series this upcoming weekend to face the Brigham Young University Cougars (4-6). Here the ‘Chos will look to fire up their bats again in this streaky start to the 2017 season. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-07/gauchos-catch-a-case-of-southern-blues-at-kentucky/","id":4143,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

The World Baseball Classic is here again, starting play on Monday, March 6. Now, I know what you may be thinking: “Who cares?” You probably have a couple good reasons to think that, too.</p>\n<p>After four world baseball classic tournaments, team USA has not even finished in the top three yet. This year, however, is different. Team USA is finally loaded, and they are trying to bring back gold for the first time in the tournament’s history.</p>\n<p>In case you may be unfamiliar with the history of the WBC and why the event came to be, here is some background. In 2005, the International Olympic Committee voted out baseball as an official Olympic sport.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because athletes still wanted to play and represent their home countries and their ancestral backgrounds, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association proposed an idea to the International Baseball Federation to somehow keep the Olympic-style play alive. The IBAF agreed and the World Baseball Classic was born. The first WBC would be held one year later in 2006.</p>\n<p>Modeled after the FIFA World Cup, the WBC features 16 teams that represent different countries. This year, Australia, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, the U.S., and Venezuela are in the official tournament.</p>\n<p>Each year, however, more and more countries enter to play in the WBC. France, Panama, Brazil, Germany, New Zealand, the Philippines, Great Britain, Nicaragua, South Africa, the Czech Republic, Pakistan and Spain were represented as well. Although these countries did not qualify for the main tournament, they did play in the qualifying rounds trying to enter the WBC. I bet you didn’t know some of these countries played baseball, huh?</p>\n<p>The past winners of the WBC include only two countries: Japan (2006, 2009) and the Dominican Republic (2013). In these years, team USA did not have a roster that represented its full potential as a country.</p>\n<p>This was because the WBC title did not have much worth to players born and raised in the U.S. Instead, All-Star caliber Major League Ball Players would elect to stay in spring training to get ready for the regular 162-game season, which includes chasing the most important title of all: World Series Champion.</p>\n<p>Paired with this, there is a lot more opportunity to make money performing well in the MLB compared to playing well in the WBC.</p>\n<p>Still, this did not stop other All-Star Major Leaguers in the past from joining their respected countries. The Dominican Republic, Japan, Puerto Rico and Venezuela have all been represented by their best athletes every WBC due to one reason and one reason only: pride.</p>\n<p>Now, enter USA in the 2017 WBC. As reported by baseball beat writers and analysts, Americans are sick of being made fun of in their locker rooms for not having a WBC title yet; they are simply tired of being mocked for doing poorly in a tournament for a sport they themselves created.</p>\n<p>So what did they do? They got together the best damn team they could.</p>\n<p>Team USA is now the favorite to win the WBC because of the team’s ridiculously stacked roster. The position players representing the U.S. are Buster Posey, Jonathan Lucroy, A.J. Ellis, Nolan Arenado, Alex Bregman, Matt Carpenter, Brandon Crawford, Paul Goldschmidt, Eric Hosmer, Ian Kinsler, Daniel Murphy, Adam Jones, Andrew McCutchen, Giancarlo Stanton and Christian Yelich.</p>\n<p>You may be thinking, where is Mike Trout? Where is Bryce Harper? Where is Corey Seager? Although these players and more were asked, they all declined for reasons stated above.</p>\n<p>Still, the U.S. will have the most powerful and skilled lineup the team has had in its history by far, and the most dangerous lineup in the tournament by a wide margin.</p>\n<p>Although they recently lost Cy Young winner Max Scherzer to a finger injury, the pitching staff includes other big names such as Chris Archer, Marcus Stroman, Michael Fulmer, Tanner Roark and Andrew Miller.</p>\n<p>The U.S. wants a piece of the WBC title pie. For the first time ever, they have a really good chance. With all this talent, will America’s golden boys pull through?</p>\n<p>In their first round pool (Pool C), team USA’s biggest threat will be the Dominican Republic, which is one of the few other teams that have a big-league roster. The U.S. should have no problems with the other two teams in their pool, Colombia, and Canada, but if the U.S. can beat out the Dominican Republic, then it should have a straight run for gold.</p>\n<p>Even though play will begin with a matchup between Israel and Korea at 1:30 a.m., team U.S.A. will not have its first game until March 10, at which they will take on Colombia in Miami.</p>\n<p>The final round of the WBC will take place in Southern California at Dodger Stadium from March 20-22. Do not miss the WBC. For the first time ever, team USA could be crowned the champion right here in our own backyard.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76218\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76218\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/why-you-should-watch-the-2017-world-baseball-classic/","id":1902,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

The lefty pitcher would prove too much for the Gaucho, which is predominantly left.</p>\n<p>The Elk Grove, Calif., native was dominant Tuesday using his two-seam fastball that would cut in on the hands of lefties. On top of this, Madrigal would use his masterful control of his slider, curveball, and changeup to carve up the strike zone.</p>\n<p>Gaucho hitters would fly out nine times of the 11 total they had for the game when Madrigal was on the mound. This was very uncharacteristic of a Gaucho team that came off an offensive barrage in a sweep of the Tulane Green Wave.</p>\n<p>The only bright spot of the afternoon offensively for the Gauchos was junior first baseman Austin Bush. Bush would smoke a low line drive homerun over the right field fence against lefty reliever freshman Ken Waldichuk in the bottom of the ninth. Bush would have two of the three total hits for the Gauchos and finished the evening 2-4 with the lone RBI.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the diamond, Saint Mary’s offense proved to be impressive by collecting 10 hits off the Gaucho pitching staff. Leading the way was designated hitter freshman Joe Vranesh who went three for four with one RBI.  The gusts blowing out to right field helped a couple balls that were struck in the gap by the Gaels, particularly on a double hit by catcher Jackson Thoreson (2 for 5, 1 RBI) to lead off the second inning. Later that inning, Thoreson would come around to score the first run for Saint Mary’s.</p>\n<p>Although hitting the ball well, the Gaels’ offense was helped by not only the wind but by the Gaucho defense as well.  In the top of the fifth inning, the ’Chos would commit four continuous errors. Two errors came from left fielder junior Colton Burns who has recently made the transition from second base to the outfield for the first time in his career.</p>\n<p>For the first committed error, Burns would let a ball get by him on a routine base hit to the outfield. The ball would reach the fence allowing the batter to reach third.</p>\n<p>The second error happened after Burns dove head first for a ball, trapping it in his glove but losing sight of the ball below his feet allowing the runner to advance to second.</p>\n<p>Another error came on a grounder that took a wild hop on redshirt junior second baseman JJ Muno. Unfortunately for Muno, although doing his best to block the ball and pick it up with his bare hand, he had no play at first.</p>\n<p>The last of the errors came on a pop fly to third baseman redshirt junior Kenny Corey that was blown around by the swirling wind. The ball would hit off the end Corey’s glove and drop to the ground. All runners would be safe.</p>\n<p>From these four errors, two runs would score. If not for these blunders, the Gauchos would be looking at an entirely different game altogether in the bottom of the ninth, especially after Bush’s homerun.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos, who are now sitting at a .500 winning percentage, had a pretty decent home stand overall winning three games and losing one.
