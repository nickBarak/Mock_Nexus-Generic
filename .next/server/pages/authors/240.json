(Photo from 2016) <em>William Emmons / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) initially created the Pardall Carnival in 2008 with the hope of uniting UCSB students with the community.</p>\n<p>Today, that goal remains the same. IVCRC’s external chair, Katrina Nicado, and Internal Chair Nicole Tan both agree that not much has changed over the years.</p>\n<p>“The Pardall Carnival continues to bring out new students to get to better know the community and gives groups and organizations a better opportunity to recruit students,” Nicado said.</p>\n<p>Close to 60 student organizations and small businesses joined the fun at the carnival this year, providing attendees with opportunities to better know them and their respective missions, alongside fun games and free goodies.</p>\n<p>Popular attractions included caricature drawings, the Hijinio “El Elotero” Camacho and the Ferris wheel emblematic of the carnival.</p>\n<p>Businesses such as Isla Vista Outfitters, HOPR and PokeCeviche all appeared on Pardall Road alongside student organizations including Life of the Party, Students Against Sexual Assault and the Queer Commision.</p>\n<p>All of the aforementioned organizations gathered to promote themselves as well as help new students feel welcomed to the community.</p>\n<p>Tan attributed Pardall Carnival’s success to the team effort that goes on behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>“We have different committees that handle different tasks, like communicating with the businesses or handling the free shirts,” she said.</p>\n<p>Ruth Garcia Guevara, Associated Students community volunteer coordinator and IVCRC advisor, organizes the carnival every year.</p>\n<p>“What started with a small group of students having an idea, has turned into one of the most anticipated events of the school year, not only for students but the entire IV community,” Guevara said in a Facebook post.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84349\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-14/pardall-carnival-brings-together-i-v-residents-for-its-10th-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84349\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-14/pardall-carnival-brings-together-i-v-residents-for-its-10th-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-14/pardall-carnival-brings-together-i-v-residents-for-its-10th-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-14/pardall-carnival-brings-together-i-v-residents-for-its-10th-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-14/pardall-carnival-brings-together-i-v-residents-for-its-10th-year/","id":4251,"author":{"id":240,"name":"Giselle Cruz"},"related":[4250,4249,4248],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/240"}},"__N_SSG":true}
