Adds Museum Studies Emphasis","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Department of the History of Art and Architecture has established a new Museum Studies emphasis for its undergraduate major.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Department of the History of Art and Architecture has established a new Museum Studies emphasis for its undergraduate major.</p>\n<p>The emphasis combines specialized courses with selective internships at the Art, Design &amp; Architecture (ADA) Museum to give students a more broad education on museum-related careers. The emphasis has three main components: lower and upper division courses and seminars specific to the Museum Studies emphasis, internship opportunities, which are provided by the ADA Museum and two courses taken outside of the department to provide an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of Museum Studies.</p>\n<p>Director of the Museum Studies emphasis and a lecturer in the Department of the History of Art and Architecture, Carole Paul said the emphasis will focus on the multiple facets of museum studies, which include emphasizes on historical, theoretical, operational and ideological aspects of art and architecture. </p>\n<p>“Many students in Art History are asking, ‘What am I going to do with a degree in Art History?’ and this is kind of a practical answer,” Paul said. “Through the internships and by giving students a broader knowledge about museums, they can begin thinking about a career path.”</p>\n<p>Paul said while most museum studies programs in the country are graduate programs with narrow foci, the new emphasis has an advantage in that it allows students to begin museum work as undergraduates.</p>\n<p>“With museum work, the sooner you’re introduced to it, the better. I myself had internships as an undergraduate. I went to Barnard College in New York, and I had an internship at the Guggenheim Museum, and I had internships in graduate school,” Paul said. “It’s a great way to learn about these fields; you can use your knowledge of Art History and find out what kind of jobs there really are out there.”</p>\n<p>Intern supervisor of the ADA Museum program Mary McGuire said internship experience is beneficial for students seeking employment at museums.</p>\n<p>“It’s my job, and the other people at the museum, it’s their job too, to write letters if someone wants one,” McGuire said. “If they’ve been an intern and they’ve shown their dedication to the museum, they’ll get a good letter by the end of their internship.” </p>\n<p>Acting director of the ADA Museum and History of Art and Architecture professor E. Bruce Robertson said the internships provided by the new emphasis give students the chance to make personal connections with professors.</p>\n<p>“One of the things that’s a little hard at UCSB because it’s a big university is to have a really personalized education experience,” Robertson said. “So one of the incentives of being an intern at the Museum is that it offers an intensely personalized experience. You’re working very, very closely with knowledgeable professionals.”</p>\n<p>McGuire said he recently traveled to Los Angeles for a tour provided by Robertson, who used to work at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).</p>\n<p>“He gave us an amazing tour about a painter who he’s very well acquainted with, who he’s written about a lot, named Marsden Hartley, and his exhibition was up at LACMA,” McGuire said. “So we got this tour from Professor Robertson that was absolutely first-hand knowledge, both of the collection — where it came from, the setting in which it was installed in the museum — and the history of the painter.”</p>\n<p>Paul said she has been working with local museums, galleries and arts organizations such as the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the Santa Barbara Historical Museum and the Arts Fund to create internships for students.</p>\n<p>“The Museum on campus has a great internship program, but also my aim with this emphasis is to give students as many options as possible,” Paul said. “So we have options within the community here in Santa Barbara, such as the Santa Barbara Museum of Art and the Historical Museum, the Arts Fund, and students can even do it further afield in Los Angeles.”</p>\n<p>Paul also said there are many departments with courses that relate to the Museum Studies emphasis, as outlined in the Museum Studies prospectus.</p>\n<p>“History, as I said, Sociology, Geography, Chicana and Chicano Studies, Religious Studies even art works very well,” Paul said. “So I think that there are lots of other majors that compliment this really well.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58700\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58700\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/art-history-dept-adds-museum-studies-emphasis/","id":2961,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[2960,2959,2958],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cross-Cultural Thanksgiving Recipes","category":"On the Menu","subcategory":"Recipes","publish_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Every time you eat an unconventional Thanksgiving meal, a bald eagle dies...Psych! Check out these culinary upgrades to your standard turkey dinner.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Thanksgiving: the great American holiday. It combines the USA’s best qualities — namely, hilariously dysfunctional family gatherings, football and massive amounts of food. What is interesting, though, is the fact that while America is known as a melting pot, there is a very specific formula for the Thanksgiving meal, which must not be deviated from …ever. Every time you eat an unconventional Thanksgiving meal, a bald eagle dies.</p>\n<p>And yet, eating your 20th turkey-with-mashed-potatoes-gravy-and-cranberry-sauce combo is a lot like eating your first turkey-with-mashed-potatoes-gravy-and-cranberry-sauce combo. So this year, why not try making things a little more interesting? But before your grandmother faints at the idea of a turkey-less Thanksgiving, let me just preface by saying that we will not be removing any vital ingredients, just having some fun with a couple side dishes. </p>\n<p>My family doesn’t really do the traditional Thanksgiving thing. Last year, we ate Burmese food instead, which involved something called shrimp paste and a fish-eggplant dish. The following recipes should in no way be as intimidating as shrimp paste, and I can personally attest to their greatness. Here are a few ideas on how to add a little pizazz and a lot of new flavors to your Thanksgiving dinner. </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<h4><strong>Lamb, Tzatziki and Pita Chip Stuffing </strong></h4>\n<p>For the Lamb<br>\n– 2 pounds of the youngest rib lamb chops you can find<br>\n– 1 cup coarse salt<br>\n– 6 tablespoons freshly ground pepper<br>\n– 6 tablespoons dried oregano, preferably Greek</p>\n<p>Place salt, pepper and oregano in small bowl and stir to make the “rub.” Coat entire lamb chop with the rub.

Whereas once we have solar, we know there’s a payback time and then it’s energy that we’re not really paying for anymore.”</p>\n<p>Riley said the use of solar panels is more environmentally friendly and that the continued reliance on non-renewable energy is not justified.</p>\n<p>“It’s just so much cleaner,” Riley said. “There’s no real reason to keep using fossil fuels if we don’t have to, and we think we don’t have to.”</p>\n<p>According to LEED program manager Jordan Sager, their office handles the design of systems and the campus energy bills and works with Southern California Edison to obtain permits for projects such as the one on Lot 22. Sager also said a motivating factor behind the construction of the solar panel system has been UC President Janet Napolitano’s Carbon Neutrality Initiative.</p>\n<p>“A little less than a year ago, when Janet Napolitano took her role as President of the UC, she announced an initiative that all the UC campuses would be carbon neutral by 2025,” Sager said. “So we’re kind of working towards working out what that means for our campus, and how we’re going to get there.”</p>\n<p>Senior Project Manager of the Design and Construction Services George Levinthal said the design of the system had to be reevaluated several times due to unforeseen issues with the module type and the structure of the system. The module type that was initially selected experienced a radical increase in demand, making it impossible to purchase without going way over budget.</p>\n<p>Levinthal said the original structure plan had to be redesigned to better accommodate the solar panels.</p>\n<p>“There were structural issues, so we went back and determined that the truss system that we have now would work much better structurally for its effect on the building,” Levinthal said. “So we went back and it was redesigned using a truss system to support the panels, and by doing that we ended up with fewer panels and less kW generating capacity than we had originally had in the first design.”</p>\n<p>According to Levinthal, Lot 22 is an ideal location for a solar energy system because the parking structure had been built with future plans for solar energy in mind. The concrete columns were strengthened to support the panels, and electrical conduits were run from the basement to the roof as preparation for the prospect of putting solar panels in.</p>\n<p>Riley also said student support for the Renewable Energy Initiative referendum, which has charged students $6 in their fees since fall 2010 and will continue to do so until 2020, is largely responsible for the solar panel installation.</p>\n<p>“Students thought it was worthwhile, very worthwhile, and voted for it. So that’s where the money’s coming from,” Riley said. “And it’s being augmented with other funds from the Student Resource Building Governance Board and the Student Fee Advisory Committee.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, November 6, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58006\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58006\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/ucsb-installs-solar-panels-on-lot-22/","id":2964,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[2963,2962,2961],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Capps, Martinez Visit I.V., Encourage Voting","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Congresswoman Lois Capps and Richard Martinez, the father of UCSB student Christopher Michael-Martinez who died in the Isla Vista mass murder this past May, visited campus and walked along the streets...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57895\" style=\"width: 951px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CappsMartinez_JohnClow_11.03.2014_11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2138963587\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57874\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57895\" data-attachment-id=\"57895\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/cappsmartinez_johnclow_11-03-2014_11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CappsMartinez_JohnClow_11.03.2014_11.jpg?fit=1600%2C927&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,927\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415031642\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"20\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"CappsMartinez_JohnClow_11.03.2014_11\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Richard Martinez–father of slain UCSB student Christopher Michael-Martinez–and Congresswoman Lois Capps speak with students in front of the UCEN on Monday.

One revision is the inclusion of “dating partners” under the definition of “intimate partners,” allowing victims to seek protection from domestic violence and stalking.</p>\n<p>The Pause for Gun Safety Act would allow friends or family members to seek a temporary “gun violence prevention order” if they fear that someone close to them is posing a threat to themselves or others. The gun violence prevention order would effectively prohibit, for a brief period, a given individual from purchasing or possessing a firearm and grant authorities permission to confiscate firearms already in possession.</p>\n<p>According to Capps, voting certain candidates into office, such as herself, will allow for changes in legislation to happen.</p>\n<p>“I’ve supported legislation ever since I got there; the relationship between gun violence and domestic violence, safety issues and now in this case, allowing a parent or someone else in a position of recognizing someone might be a danger to themselves or others, to intervene in time for the guns to be confiscated,” Capps said.</p>\n<p>Since the events of May 23, Martinez said he has toured the country, visiting 11 states as well as Washington D.C. in a campaign to change state legislation regarding gun safety.</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, solving gun violence issues requires more than one answer.</p>\n<p>“There’s no one solution to gun violence; it’s a multifaceted problem,” Martinez said, “There isn’t one solution to this kind of thing. You make changes that incrementally solve the issue.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said voting is a response that is one potential solution to gun violence.</p>\n<p>“Voting matters,” Martinez said. “It’s a black-and-white choice.”</p>\n<p>According to Capps, gun control is not the only pressing issue in this “critical” election.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always been a champion for making college more affordable,” Capps said. “We want to make sure that we protect the environment, that we put people to work in projects that will bring our economy forward, take advantage of alternative energy other than fossil fuels. There’s protecting Medicare and social security. There’s all kinds of issues at stake in this election.”</p>\n<p>Later in the evening, Capps went door-to-door in I.V. to ask community members to vote the next day. This morning, she was up at 5:00 a.m. to hang pamphlets on the doorknobs of the residences in I.V. to remind voters to turn in ballots.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of excitement in this election, so they forget about the ballot, it’s still sitting on top of the refrigerator, and then they say ‘Oh my gosh, I have this ballot here!’ Well they can take it to any polling place,” Capps said, “And there’s several of them around Isla Vista and UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Hillel, Saint Michael’s University Church, Saint Mark’s University Parish and Merton Housing Co-Op are all polling places located in I.V., while on-campus voters can go to the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge, the Loma Pelona Center and the Linda Vista Room in Santa Catalina.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-04/capps-martinez-visit-i-v-encourage-voting/","id":3632,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[3631,3630,3629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"City Council Meets to Discuss New Halloween Restrictions","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Goleta City Council held its annual Isla Vista Halloween meeting on Thursday to inform Goleta inhabitants on how to stay safe this Halloween.

City of Goleta Chief of Police Lt. Butch Arnoldi said residents of Goleta should limit parking space for the I.V. Halloween attendees to prevent similar disturbances.</p>\n<p>“I would encourage the residents to obtain the permits and park on the streets in front of your residence,” Arnoldi said. “Because, you know, if your car is parked there then an out of town visitor can’t park there, correct? So if you wanna protect your domain, put your vehicles in front of your house.”</p>\n<p>Twelve additional deputies and 100 police officers volunteered from other UC campuses to serve I.V. on Halloween weekend. The UCSB Police Department will have all of its members working on Halloween night with directed patrols taking place around Goleta businesses and hotels. Highway patrol will also establish driving under the influence checkpoints, K9 units and commercial units. Five extra ambulances staffed specifically for I.V. and four additional transport vans have been contributed by the Emergency Medical Response team. Additionally, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department will have an extra engine available.</p>\n<p>UCSB Police Department Sgt. <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-06/question-authority-returns/\">Mark Signa</a> said the university bares many responsibilities towards the residents of I.V., particularly in light of the events of the past year.</p>\n<p>“There’s no doubt whatsoever that the impact of the events of last year in Isla Vista have affected not just Isla Vista but the community of Goleta as well,” Signa said. “The University of California has recognized that, and realized that we have a lot to do and a lot we need to do for the community, including the community of Goleta. It’s something that affects all of us.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_52786\" style=\"width: 636px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Halloween-2013-3.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"709091727\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57115\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52786\" data-attachment-id=\"52786\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/in-photos-halloween-weekend/halloween-2013-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Halloween-2013-3.jpeg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Halloween 2013 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Halloween-2013-3.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Halloween-2013-3.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-52786\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Halloween-2013-3-1024x683.jpeg?resize=626%2C417\" alt=\"Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus\" width=\"626\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Halloween-2013-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Halloween-2013-3.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Halloween-2013-3.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-52786\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>This article is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-21/city-council-meets-to-discuss-new-halloween-restrictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-21/city-council-meets-to-discuss-new-halloween-restrictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-21/city-council-meets-to-discuss-new-halloween-restrictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-21/city-council-meets-to-discuss-new-halloween-restrictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-21/city-council-meets-to-discuss-new-halloween-restrictions/","id":3452,"author":{"id":174,"name":"Lisa Maillard"},"related":[3451,3450,3449],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/174"}},"__N_SSG":true}
