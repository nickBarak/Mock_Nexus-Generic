Graduate and undergraduate students, Office of Financial Aid representatives, professors, KCSB staff members and Associated Students (A.S.) attended the We’re fUCked discussion, addressing issues regarding tuition hikes and how the May Revise will affect students.</p>\n<p>Though tuition is now frozen for in-state students over the next two years, tuition for out-of-state residents will increase by eight percent per year, according to UCSB Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships Michael Miller.</p>\n<p>“Every student pays the mandatory UC tuition, which is $12,192,” Miller said. “Non-residents supplemental tuition is an additional $24,000 on top of that. Eight percent is definitely not good news for out-of-state students, and we can’t give out-of-state students any more financial aid than we do our California students.”</p>\n<p>According Miller, UCSB has the highest campus-based fees of all the UC campuses with a total cost of $25,836 for a student living on campus, $12,192 of which is for tuition.</p>\n<p>“Our campus-based fees are $1,673 — that is certainly concerning,” Miller said. “One of the other fees that’s really concerning is the Gaucho Health Insurance, which is over $2,700. Just a few years ago, it was $1,375, so that’s been a massive, massive increase.”</p>\n<p>Miller said while about 70 percent of UCSB students receive some form of financial aid, UCSB should allocate more money for scholarships.</p>\n<p>“One area we really need a lot of work on is scholarships,” Miller said. “We only administer about $13.2 million worth of scholarships and, of that, $4.1 come from outside agencies.”</p>\n<p>Gevirtz School graduate student of education and co-host of KCSB’s “Radio Occupy” Kathy Swift said the 2008 market crash created a “tuition crisis” of trillions of dollars in student debt, the highest of any single consumer debt within the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Basically, we have a situation in which we have austerity across the United States, and it’s finally starting to trickle down to the university system,” Swift said. “Student debt and student loans have become the most pressing area of consumer debt in the United States. It surpassed every other area of consumer debt.”</p>\n<p>Swift said the debt students are accumulating while obtaining higher education is negatively affecting their daily lifestyles, which goes against the “American Dream.”</p>\n<p>“Students are so desperate that we have to provide food banks for them, and some students are living out of their cars and in less-than-good housing situations,” Swift said. “This is madness.”</p>\n<p>According to Swift, the tuition crisis the millennial generation is facing stifles upward mobility because many cannot afford to pursue a higher education.</p>\n<p>“The mission statement of California says we should all be guaranteed higher education,” Swift said. “That’s not really the case anymore. That social contract is gone now.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63457\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63457\" data-attachment-id=\"63457\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/mcc-may-14th-2015/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,401\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D600\",\"caption\":\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431618847\",\"copyright\":\"Hari Patel\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"110\",\"iso\":\"1250\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MCC, May 14th, 2015.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?fit=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63457\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=600%2C401\" alt=\"Hari Patel/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tuition-Panel_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Hari Patel/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB Chair and professor of black studies Jeffrey Stewart said the education policy has been changed to outsourcing universities while increasing funding for prisons.</p>\n<p>“The idea of neoliberalism has taken over to where everyone is now looked at as a private corporation,” Stewart said. “The larger dynamic is taxpayers in the state of California no longer think your education is worth their tax dollars. They feel more comfortable paying for prisons to lock up people.”</p>\n<p>Stewart also said the decision to stagnate tuition for two years is only a temporary solution to satisfy student concerns, and problems will still be present at the end of the freeze.</p>\n<p>“Freezing the tuition for two years only allows for the activists to graduate,” Stewart said. “It also leads you to believe that the current situation is acceptable, but it’s not. Where can we begin to organize to put political pressure on those who make those decisions?”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major Jared Daniels said the UC creating a three-party system, under which funding methods are different for UC campuses, California State campuses and City College campuses, created a hierarchal system rather than facilitating collaboration between students.</p>\n<p>“Before this tri-party system, universities were a free-for-all, competing against one another for the funds the state could give them,” Daniels said. “So in 1960, the UC President and state government came together and passed what was known as the ‘master plan’ which established the three-party system based on accessibility and quality.”</p>\n<p>According to Daniels, the master plan did not provide long-term sustainable resources for revenue, and President Regan’s economic policies required students to pay for education as opposed to the government providing public education.</p>\n<p>“We were just always hoping that California taxpayers would be willing to pay higher taxes for the system and we always figured the politicians would find the money,” Daniels said. “But obviously that’s not quite the case.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA policy analyst and fourth-year political science major Brett Carpenter said the UC is admitting a greater percentage of students from out-of-state to increase funding.</p>\n<p>“We’re admitting more and more of them into our schools each year,” Carpenter said. “That’s because we get a lot of money from them and the out-of-state tuition goes straight to the campus. There is a very identifiable incentive to take more of those people.”</p>\n<p>According to Carpenter, privatization of universities devalues a Bachelor’s degree, making it difficult to get a job after graduation, which incentivizes students to pursue post-undergraduate education.</p>\n<p>“The UC really has no interest in getting you a job after graduation,” Carpenter said. “Why? Because you can come back and pay them for a Master’s degree. They want to provide us with the lowest cost education they can while extracting from us the most money.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63467\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63467\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/evpsa-office-congregates-in-support-of-were-fucked/","id":2748,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2747,2746,2745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Covers Funding Requests, 2015-2016 Budget","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"On Wednesday, the Associated Student Senate discussed proposals to fund student groups, stirring up controversy","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h2>On Wednesday, the Associated Student Senate discussed proposals to fund student groups, stirring up controversy</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_62942\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62942\" data-attachment-id=\"62942\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/senate-covers-funding-requests-2015-2016-budget/senate_lorenzo-basilio-1-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430337049\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62942\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?resize=600%2C399\" alt=\"Student senators try to keep themsleves entertained during last night’s meeting, during which they discussed monetary issues.

Senate voted to fund Active Minds and denied the Persian Student Group’s request because it already received funding this school year.</p>\n<p>Co-president of UCSB Active Minds Lilia Goldenberg said the group will host guest speaker Meg Hutchinson and an open-mic night for students on May 20 to discuss the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“[Hutchinson is] a poet and a songwriter who uses yoga and meditation and suffers from bipolar disorder,” Goldenberg said. “We’re opening it up into an open mic night afterwards in light of the tragedy, so we want to bring out student artists and pretty much anyone who wants to express anything that they feel in regards to the tragedy.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>There should be exceptions to every rule for certain things, including things like sexual assault, mental health. There are some issues that are bigger than normal precedents and I think we should fully fund them. – A.S. CCS Collegiate Senator Liam Stanton</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. Senator and second-year economics and accounting major Steven Kwok said Senate should grant Active Minds’ request for $1,000 to fund the event, despite Senate’s precedent to not fund Office of Student Life (OSL) student groups.</p>\n<p>“I know we set a precedent not funding OSL groups, but because of the gravity of all things coming together next month I think we should grant this request,” Kwok said.</p>\n<p>A.S. CCS Collegiate Senator and second-year CCS physics major Liam Stanton said he agreed with Kwok that Senate should make an exception to the rule given the sensitivity of the issue.</p>\n<p>“There should be exceptions to every rule for certain things, including things like sexual assault, mental health,” Stanton said. “There are some issues that are bigger than normal precedents and I think we should fully fund them.”</p>\n<p>The Senate voted to grant the full $1,000 for the event.</p>\n<p>A.S. Chief Financial Officer and fourth-year psychology major Andre Theus said Senate should not fund the Persian Student Group’s request for $500 for food at the upcoming Persian Student Group culture show because it already granted the group funding earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>“If you had read the minutes, you would have known that,” Theus said. “Lead with your heart on decisions, but also lead with the legal code.”</p>\n<p>Theus said A.S. must adhere to the legal code because it affects future decisions for unallocated funds.</p>\n<p>“We set a precedent of not using that Senate unallocated money,” Theus said. “That’s not what the purpose is.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The University of California system was built on a foundation of quality, affordability and accessibility for the state. And, yet, in the last few decades, the state of California has shown a pattern of consistent disinvestment in how it funds higher education — currently students are paying for the bulk of the funding for higher education. – A.S. Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus</p></blockquote>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy said Senate can pull money from the Internal Vice President’s (IVP’s) special projects fund because she recently increased its funding.</p>\n<p>“Senate unallocated funding has been used to fund A.S. groups that need additional revenue for programs or projects,” Guthy said. “When I was going through the budget, my top priority was re-funding groups that got cut. I did increase special projects funding for IVP so that’s where senate can pull from for some of its projects.”</p>\n<p>Senator Matthew Santos said he did not feel comfortable voting on Guthy’s proposed budget with so many senators absent.</p>\n<p>“Right now there are more proxies here than there are people,” Santos said. “I’d much rather take a vote with all of our senators present because I’d rather have Daisy and Nadia and Koo and Iseah and Firenze and Jenna.”</p>\n<p>The senate voted to table the budget proposal for one week.</p>\n<p>Theus said the UC system has lost sight of its original goal to bring an affordable education to its students.</p>\n<p>“The University of California system was built on a foundation of quality, affordability and accessibility for the state,” Theus said. “And, yet, in the last few decades, the state of California has shown a pattern of consistent disinvestment in how it funds higher education — currently students are paying for the bulk of the funding for higher education.”</p>\n<p>Theus said he updated the Financial Resource Guide to show students where UC tuition goes.</p>\n<p>“This guide has been designed to help students understand how much they pay on the UC level, the UCSB level and into the Associated Students,” Theus said. “This resource aims to make these fees more transparent for you and to help you navigate the complicated financial procedures that revolve around funding.”</p>\n<p>Letters and Science Collegiate Senator and third-year history of public policy major Zach Goulhiane said the Study Bean, the Davidson Library coffee counter, will operate 24/7 during dead and finals week again Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>“We got the results for the 24-hour café,” Goulhiane said. “We lost only 500 dollars, so that’s good, so they put it past the board again and they accepted it so we’re gonna have a 24-hour café again for this quarter.”</p>\n<p>According to External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year political science major Melvin Singh, the recently launched “Dear Governor Brown” campaign to address tuition hikes is attracting national attention and creating a platform for students to discuss concerns.</p>\n<p>“It’s been about 24 hours, but I have people from elsewhere messaging me saying, ‘Why is this a California thing?’” Singh said. “‘Why don’t you make it a nationwide thing?’ Basically, we created a place for people to talk about problems and validate what’s going on when it comes to tuition increases.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday,

Nexus</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Associated Students organization Take Back the Night hosted their annual rally and march on Thursday night at Anisq’Oyo’ Park to address sexual assault in Isla Vista and to protest the climate of fear and violence women face near campus areas.</p>\n<p>Approximately 40 participants attended the event to support the campaign against sexual violence. The event included poetry readings, music, art, games, t-shirt making and art projects.</p>\n<p>Editors from <em>Feministing.com</em> Lori Adelman and Jos Truitt spoke at the event about what constitutes feminism.  Adelman said feminism might cause strife between genders as power dynamics change.</p>\n<p>“When we’re talking about feminist goals, we’re not necessarily talking about a zero-sum game,” Adelman said. “There are some things that we are asking, telling and demanding that men and people who have been operating under the privilege of patriarchy give up. And it’s not something they can do without maybe some direct personal loss.”</p>\n<p>According to Adelman, feminism is not a friendly request, but a demand for what is owed to an individual.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t us asking for you to do us a favor and be nice and from the bottom of your heart or to be kind and give us these small feminist wins,” Adelman said. “We’re asking and demanding power. It’s not always going to be an amicable relationship.”</p>\n<p>At sunset, attendees marched through I.V. with signs labeled “Slut shame is victim blame” and “My body is mine.” After the march, attendees regrouped at Anisq’Oyo’ Park for a “survivor circle” to share personal thoughts and stories about sexual violence.</p>\n<p>Take Back the Night Co-chair and third-year feminist studies and English double major and Kelty Kauffman said females are constantly on edge when they are out in the streets after dark.</p>\n<p>“It’s scary going out at night,” Kauffman said. “When you’re someone who’s not a straight white dude, going out at night means doing a checklist in your mind of things that could go wrong, figuring out how to keep yourself safe.”</p>\n<p>According to Kauffman, this year’s event saw a new, wider range of emotions compared to last year’s.</p>\n<p>“This year’s event had a lot of heart,” Kauffman said. “There were a lot of tears and there was a lot of healing, but there was also a lot of laughter, which is not something that I’ve experienced in these spaces before, and that felt really, really good. We were okay to laugh. It was allowed. People were allowed to express themselves however they needed to.”</p>\n<p>Kauffman said the organization aims to empower women in order to gain the same privileges as men.</p>\n<p>“The phrase ‘take back the night’ means taking back our autonomy, our ability to leave the house, our ability to do things like a regular person would, and by regular I mean straight white dudes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said after she was sexually assaulted last year, survivor resources at UCSB advised her against taking the case to court against her wishes. According to Melgoza, Judicial Affairs claimed the case would not make it to court, and if it did, she would not win.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately I only got to enjoy my college experience one quarter here at UCSB,” Melgoza said. “Survivors all have different ways of healing and coping … There’s not a single label or stereotype but unfortunately, Judicial Affairs wanted me to fit a mold. I had to persist and literally argue with them through phone calls, emails and appointments. I had to make sure they were doing their job.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major Maya Trifunovic said the event was informative and ensured the topic of rape remained relevant.</p>\n<p>“We still live in a rape culture,” Trifunovic said. “There’s a lot of conversations that I think especially people our age need to be having about the society we want to build as we go out into it. I think it’s a good space and really educated people with a lot of resources and ideas about how to fix that.”</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology and psychology double major Alexandra Ballinger said there is more to sexual violence than the victim and the perpetrator, and “sexism encourages rape culture.”</p>\n<p>“There’s so much that plays into sexual assault. I think people tend to look at it as a person to person thing, like it’s an individual perpetrator’s problem,” Ballinger said. “But really, it’s a result of people giving their tacit approval.”</p>\n<p>According to Ballinger, events such as Take Back the Night remind community members and survivors that they are not alone.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really important that survivors know that other people care,” Ballinger said, “and that there’s awareness about it. Being here is educational. It helps me learn more about what’s really going on and things under the surface.”</p>\n<p>Ballinger said sexual assault is more common than most students realize.</p>\n<p>“I think everybody knows someone who is a survivor,” Ballinger said. “You could be sitting in lecture and the person next to you could be a survivor and you wouldn’t know. People just don’t know that they know survivors.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year feminist studies and global studies double major Presly Mellor said “taking back the night” means women should not have to live in fear.</p>\n<p>“I see it very literally where we take back the night,” Mellor said, “where we, as women, can walk freely without feeling threatened, without feeling the need to look over our shoulder multiple times on a walk back home at night, I don’t have to worry about being too drunk or having to walk down a dark street.”</p>\n<p>According to Mellor, she hopes the organization will continue its fight to end sexual violence and assault.</p>\n<p>“For me, it’s really empowering to see what younger students are organizing and leading because I’m on my way out, but I still want this work to be done,” Mellor said. “It’s really nice to hear that first-, second- and third-years are going to be dedicated to this cause the rest of their time at UCSB.”</p>\n<p>Mellor said though participation rates have not changed since she attended in 2013, the diversity of participants has greatly increased.</p>\n<p>“There’s been a change in the people coming which I think is good, because it shows that more people are interested and different kinds of people, all different majors, different years,” Mellor said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62569\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62569\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-17/take-back-the-night-event-advocates-for-womens-safety/","id":4721,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[4720,4719,4718],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

President, Internal Vice President, on-campus senator and university owned off-campus senator discussed key issues in an open forum Thursday afternoon at the Hub.</p>\n<p>Prompted by questions texted in from the audience, the candidates discussed budget, police relations, sexual assault, mental health, I.V. self-governance and the A.S. senate resolution to divest from companies carrying out human rights violations in Israel-Palestine, which was voted down at Wednesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>A.S. President</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Third-year political science major and presidential candidate from Free Thinking Patriots (FTP) Jason Garshfield had the floor to himself during the presidential candidate forum due to his opponent, Jimmy Villarreal of the Open People’s Party (OPP), having a midterm scheduled during the forum.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he aims to represent unheard voices in the student body and cited voter apathy as evidence of voters feeling alienated from current A.S. leadership.</p>\n<p>“I want to give students a voice that they haven’t been given, because I don’t believe that the current administration is adequately representing students at this university,” Garshfield said. “In the last election, only 37 percent of students voted … It only takes five minutes to vote on GOLD. So I think if 63 percent of students can’t be bothered to vote, there’s something wrong with the system. I aim to be a voice for that 63 percent of students.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The number one thing is an umbrella and that thing is freedom. That thing is defending the rights and civil liberties we have as students. I don’t believe there is a voice for civil liberties on the A.S. Board. – Candidate Jason Garshfield</p></blockquote>\n<p>Garshfield said he believes current A.S. President Ali Guthy did not make a strong enough effort to be accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“I think accessibility is a big problem and one of my criticisms of the current administration is a lack of accessibility because I think a lot of students probably don’t know who the A.S. president is,” Garshfield said. “I’d like to have events like pizza with the president … It’s a very easy problem when you’re behind a desk to forget who you’re representing.”</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, the police in Isla Vista should turn their focus away from “victimless crimes” and towards other crimes such as sexual assault and thefts.</p>\n<p>“Police resources are scarce … I don’t want to decrease these resources, I want them to be used properly,” Garshfield said. “A 20-year-old having a beer at a party is not something police should be going after, somebody stumbling drunk down the street not doing harm to anyone else is not something police should be going after. All sorts of victimless crimes should be ignored,” Garshfield said. “The police in this town need to be focusing on real problems.”</p>\n<p>On the topic of Assemblymember Das Williams’ state assembly bill (AB 3) to create a Community Services District as a solution to the call for increased self-governance in I.V., Garshfield said legislatures should instead be aiming for cityhood.</p>\n<p>“I think that AB 3 doesn’t go far enough. I don’t believe in half measures in relation to cityhood and so I will not settle for a Community Services District, I will make sure that Isla Vista becomes a city,” Garshfield said.</p>\n<p>When an audience member asked what Garshfield’s number one most important objective would be as president, Garshfield said he would promote freedom.</p>\n<p>“The number one thing is an umbrella and that thing is freedom,” Garshfield said. “That thing is defending the rights and civil liberties we have as students. I don’t believe there is a voice for civil liberties on the A.S. Board.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Internal Vice President</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major and On-Campus Senator representing OPP Kimia Hashemian and third-year chemistry and political science double major and current Letters and Science Collegiate Senator Zach Goulhiane running independently spoke about their goals and platforms for the position of Internal Vice President, an executive office primarily in charge of preceding over the A.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>On whether or not senators should be allowed to cast secret ballots, Hashemian said the practice is acceptable under certain circumstances, citing death threats made against UC Irvine student government members who supported a bill to remove the United States flag from the student government lobby there.</p>\n<p>“Senators need to be held accountable,” Hashemian said. “However if there is a topic where senators are threatened by students, like at UCI with the flag resolution, then I agree with a secret ballot because the safety of the senators is important to me and the most important aspect.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to make sure that when Week of Welcome and tabling events come around we continue to push freshman and incoming students to actually understand what we have to offer and what they can do to change UCSB. – Letters and Science Collegiate Senator Zach Goulhiane</p></blockquote>\n<p>Goulhiane said he shares a similar opinion on that issue, arguing that an individual’s safety outweighs students’ need for transparency.</p>\n<p>“It is really important to know how your representatives vote, but when it comes to circumstances in which people feel unsafe about voting because they believe certain people will be against them, I feel that since we are students, the safety of us and everyone else should be kept in mind,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>Goulhiane said his experience modifying the A.S. legal code to clarify the language makes him more qualified to manage internal senate issues.</p>\n<p>“I personally was a part of the legal code reconstruction committee where we moved and around and switched ideas in sections and articles so that it all position duties would be in one area and not scattered all around. This will allow for future elected officials to know what they have to do and not have to waste a whole quarter trying to figure that out,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>But Hashemian also said also has experience making changes to the A.S. legal code, and plans to further educate senators on the code’s policies if elected.</p>\n<p>“Last year I was an on-campus senator and we created the legal code that created the new structure of A.S.,” Hashemian said. “For next year, I plan on teaching senators what the A.S. legal code is and seeing what problems there are and what needs to be changed.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said if elected, she would emphasize encouraging students to be involved with A.S. using events such as a craft fair to get students excited about student government.</p>\n<p>“Students pay $180 into A.S., but not everyone’s involved or excited to be involved,” Hashemian said. “I want to collaborate with students through my craft fair. I want to bring entrepreneurial students into A.S. This brings a whole new perspective into A.S.”</p>\n<p>Goulhiane said he plans to reach out to younger students early in the school year to get more people working with A.S.</p>\n<p>“I want to make sure that when Week of Welcome and tabling events come around we continue to push freshman and incoming students to actually understand what we have to offer and what they can do to change UCSB,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>Goulhiane said he plans to work to improve I.V.’s reputation, because the public tends to confuse I.V. with UCSB, leading students to take the blame for events that are out of their control.</p>\n<p>“Making sure that Isla Vista gets fixed has been a huge priority for me and I’ve had the support of Chancellor Yang, the I.V. Foot Patrol and other entities to try and figure out a way to change Isla Vista’s image, because sadly, outside of UCSB, a lot of people see I.V. with a direct connection to UCSB and automatically assume that UCSB students are responsible for whatever takes place there,” Goulhiane said.</p>\n<p>Hashemian said while working to keep Deltopia a safe event during the first weekend of April, she came to understand volunteering as a way to potentially improve I.V.’s reputation.</p>\n<p>“Recently we have been building a better image in Isla Vista and I hope that we continue to do so. Recently during Deltopia I was part of a group called UCIV that passed out water to students and others and made sure that everyone stayed safe and out of trouble,” Hashemian said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Senators</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The three candidates for on-campus senator and the single candidate for university owned off-campus senator discussed A.S. budget, residence halls, mental health, sexual assault and divestment during their forum. All four represent the Open People’s Party (OPP) and are running unopposed.</p>\n<p>Regarding allocation of A.S.’s roughly $11 million dollar budget, third-year global studies major and University Owned Housing Senator candidate Joana Barrera said she wants to spend fees as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>“We plan to work as senators to distribute as much money as possible and not waste any money,” Barrera said. “It is important all fees are equally distributed.”</p>\n<p>Barrea also said she would make A.S.’s budgetary decisions more transparent.</p>\n<p>“We want to reach out to students and make sure they are knowledgeable about the fees and where their money is going,” Barrera said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A.S. should be more transparent in their financial ways. – On-Campus Senator candidate Jose Magana</p></blockquote>\n<p>First-year economics and political science double major and On-Campus Senator candidate Nawar Nemeh said he would make sure students starting official campus organizations understand how to access guaranteed funding.</p>\n<p>“Finance and Business Committee currently has a rule that any organization in OSL or basically on campus the past two years gets $250 dollar start up fund that is always guaranteed,” Nemeh said. “I would want to expand that so anyone who wants to start a student group in OSL has the necessary funds to do so.”</p>\n<p>First-year art history major and On-Campus Senator candidate Lacy Wright said she would focus on funding campus services.</p>\n<p>“I would want to focus our student fees to services that students use, especially A.S. Program Board concerts, A.S. bike shop,” Wright said.</p>\n<p>Wright said she also hopes to establish textbook banks in residence halls to save students’ money.</p>\n<p>“For more popular classes, students can share textbooks and use them there,” Wright said. “Students can save on textbooks, which costs such a huge amount of money and can be a giant burden on students.”</p>\n<p>First-year political science major and On-Campus Senator candidate Jose Magana said he has an idea for an app that would help students understand the A.S. budget.</p>\n<p>“A.S. should be more transparent in their financial ways,” Magana said. “One way I feel this would be innovative and relevant to our campus is creating an app that will let students know what was allocated to what.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh says he will work with his constituents by attending residence hall council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Increasing accessibility to A.S., I will attend hall councils on a weekly basis,” Nemeh said. “We plan to do that and engage and see what the students want.”</p>\n<p>Barrera said her main goal will be expanding Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) beyond main campus.</p>\n<p>“The one on campus is too far from students,” Barrera said. “I want to allocate funding for expanding those services.”</p>\n<p>Wright also said she wants to expand the reach of CAPS.</p>\n<p>“I want to add more mental health services to the outlying dormitory halls and resident apartments,” Wright said. “They are left unstaffed and it’s unacceptable. I will work to bring funding back to CAPS.”</p>\n<p>Barrera said she will focus on resources for transfer students.</p>\n<p>“I also want to start up transfer student center … and start an online forum for transfer students to share textbooks, share class schedules and become more united as a community,” Barrera said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh said he would work to implement reports on campus energy efficiency.</p>\n<p>“To publish a yearly energy efficiency report to see how UCSB gets its energy … and how we can move towards reducing reliance on nonrenewable energy and moving towards things like solar energy,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Magana said he would help other A.S. officers create temporary housing solutions to combat student houselessness.</p>\n<p>“We want to find a way for the university to work on insuring international students or recently evicted students do not have to stay on the street or couch surf for a period of time,” Magana said. “The university can find some sort of amenity, maybe in the classrooms overnight for them to continue looking.”</p>\n<p>Wright, a survivor of a sexual assault, said she wants to expand counseling services, specifically for other survivors.</p>\n<p>“So something important to me is expanding resources for survivors, especially having enough counselors on hand to be able to work with survivors as well as making sure that they are trained specifically how to respond to sexual assault,” Wright said.</p>\n<p>Magana said his main goal will be to improve campus mental health services.</p>\n<p>“My main goal overall is working on mental health and diversifying it by getting more counselors that actively represent the student body as well as expanding these services to the residence halls,” Magna said.</p>\n<p>Regarding divestment, Nemeh said each candidate’s position does not reflect OPP.</p>\n<p>“I want to make it very clear that our opinions on these issues are ours and ours alone. The party does not take a stance on geopolitical issues,” Nemeh said.</p>\n<p>Nemeh, who said he supports divestment, said he did not approve of senate’s use of secret ballots when voting on the proposed divestment resolution at Wednesday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“I think that is extremely unfair. I don’t think the senate should hide behind secret votes when making decisions that are so important to so many students on our campus.”</p>\n<p>Wright said she chooses not to form an opinion because she represents a divided community of students.</p>\n<p>“I believe my job, as a senator, is to represent the voices of the students,” Wright said. “Yesterday’s meeting has proven that the students are really divided, so I believe I can’t really make a stance on it if I can’t fully represent the voices of the students.”</p>\n<p>Elections for all A.S. positions will be held on GOLD April 20-23.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Hall.<em> Brendan Mansfield/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Navy Sea, Air, Land Teams (SEAL) soldier and best-selling author Eric Greitens spoke at Campbell Hall on Thursday night on his recently released book<em> Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life</em>, a compilation of 23 letters between Greitens and a former SEAL comrade who was struggling with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>\n<p>Greitens, who was awarded the United States Armed Forces Bronze Star and listed on <em>Fortune</em> magazine’s World’s 50 Greatest Leaders in 2014 and<em> Time</em> magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in 2013, spoke to a crowd of approximately 250 students, faculty, community members and Arts &amp; Lectures donors. Greitens is also a Rhodes Scholar, a White House Fellow and founder and CEO of The Mission Continues, a non-profit organization which challenges veterans to serve and lead in communities across the country.</p>\n<p>Throughout the lecture, Greitens focused on how to grow from personal experiences, stating that growth is necessary to move on from past hardship.</p>\n<p>“You cannot bounce back from hardship. You can only move through it,” Greitens said. “No one escapes pain, fear, and suffering. Yet from pain can come wisdom; from fear can come courage; and from suffering can come strength — if we have the value of resilience.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through – Eric Greitens</p></blockquote>\n<p>Greitens also discussed the importance of meeting obstacles in order to progress in life and said that, as Navy SEALS, he and his colleagues understood the word “frontline” to mean “the place where we met the enemy,” but frontline is not just a “military term.”</p>\n<p>“In fact, you have a frontline in your life now,” Greitans said. “Everyone has a place where they encounter fear, where they struggle, suffer, and face hardship. … It is on the frontline of our lives that we earn wisdom, create joy, forge friendships, discover happiness, find love and do purposeful work.”</p>\n<p>According to Greitens, the most important factor in dealing with hardship is figuring out to work through life’s challenges.</p>\n<p>“Everyone has a place in life where they have to deal with hardship and challenge and pain and difficulty fear,” Greitens said. “But it’s often our ability to navigate those places — of hardship and difficulty — that grow essential to our ability to live life in a purpose, productive and meaningful way.”</p>\n<p>Greitens said he believes resilience is a way of working through hardship rather than returning to a state of being prior to experiencing hardship.</p>\n<p>“When most people think of resilience … we cannot bounce back because we cannot go back in time to the people we used to be. There is no bouncing back. There is only moving through,” Greitens said. “Resilient people do not bounce back from hard experiences. They find healthy ways to integrate them into their lives. In time, people can confront great calamity with great spirit and can create great strength.”</p>\n<p>Third-year math major at Golden West College in Huntington Beach Nick Wolfe said he traveled to Goleta, CA., from Anaheim to hear Greitens speak.</p>\n<p>“I’m a fan of his work,” Wolfe said. “I’ve read his past book <em>The Heart and The Fis</em>t and I’ve acquired his other book, which is pretty similar.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience. But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. – Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wolfe said he was considering joining the military before he sustained a personal injury, but still enjoys learning about Greitens’ military career.</p>\n<p>“I’ve read the book already and some of the things he did say were verbatim,” Wolfe said. “But he did hit a lot of the more important topics harder on the head as he felt necessary and it was nice to hear it in his voice for the first time. That was awesome. I have respect for humanity and life in general and the way he approaches and sees it is really fascinating. Really, it’s respectable.”</p>\n<p>First-year mechanical engineering major Herman Li said he attended Greitens’ lecture because of his prior training experience with the United States Marine Corps. According to Li, the lecture was more successful and influenced him more than previous, similar events he has attended.</p>\n<p>“I just thought his advice on getting through pain and suffering was really good … to build resilience,” Li said. “I wasn’t expecting this many people because I went to an event a few weeks ago where a marine was speaking and there was only like ten people.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major Patrick Mossman said he attended the lecture to learn more about the military.</p>\n<p>“I’m interested in joining Army ROTC [Reserve Officers’ Training Corps] here and I just decided to come because I thought it would be interesting hearing from someone, especially a Navy SEAL,” Mossman said. “He had a lot of interesting things to say. I definitely learned some things.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Codie Franklin said hearing Greitens speak was as an impactful learning experience.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have any connections to the military. No family members, no personal experience,” Franklin said. “But I think the ideas he shared here tonight are relevant to me, too. I liked his ideas of growing from what we have experienced. He said something like, ‘What happens to us becomes a part of us’ and that really resonated with me.”</p>\n<p>According to Franklin, Greiten’s idea of “segmenting,” or breaking work assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks, was helpful.</p>\n<p>“That’s helpful in everyday life,” Franklin said. “As students, and a lot of us with jobs, we have busy lives that can seem overwhelming. So I’ll be using this segmenting advice in my life.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/former-navy-seal-speaks-on-new-book/","id":2841,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[2840,2839,2838],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Deltopia Calmer Than Last Year’s","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This past weekend’s Deltopia street party did not repeat last year’s violent riots and drew only half the crowd, with approximately 10,000 people on the streets of Isla Vista by midday and only ro...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_62043\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1661429318\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"62040\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62043\" data-attachment-id=\"62043\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/deltopia-participants-walking-on-dp/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"6.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T4i\",\"caption\":\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1428154403\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0015625\",\"title\":\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Deltopia_Alex Gonzalez\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62043\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Deltopia_Alex-Gonzalez-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Deltopia participants walking on DP.

The Sheriff’s Office partially attributed smaller crowds to the efforts of I.V. residents to defer out-of-towners from coming into their homes and parties. Other factors contributing to the decrease in attendees, according to the Sheriff’s Office, include the university’s efforts, student-only activities, over 100 police officers from across UC campuses and assistance from law enforcement agencies from the surrounding counties. According to the Sheriff’s Office, the county festival ordinance prohibiting music after 6 p.m. and restricting parking on certain streets in I.V. and Goleta was “instrumental” in reducing the crowd size.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated. – Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the 50 percent decrease in attendance from last year, the Sheriff’s Office stated the number of arrests and citations remained high because of increased presence of law enforcement. Preliminary numbers provided by the Sheriff’s Office count 140 citations and 102 arrests issued, compared to 190 citations and 130 arrests during last year’s Deltopia. Medical incidents this year also decreased significantly with only nine medical transports reported compared to 50 in 2014.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Education Officer Mike Eliason said in an email the crowds this past weekend were more manageable compared to last year.</p>\n<p>“The crowds were smaller and more respectful than last year,” Eliason said in an email. “On more than several occasions, students came up to our crews and thanked them for being there, which was very appreciated.”</p>\n<p>According to Eliason, the calmer crowds were in part due to the planning and coordination that began months prior to the event.</p>\n<p>“I think the tremendous planning and coordinated effort by everyone affiliated with the event helped to make it more enjoyable than last year,” Eliason said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said the number of arrests and citations were a reflection of the saturation of police within I.V. and not necessarily of a reckless student body.</p>\n<p>“Keep in mind that there were over 300 police officers in a one square mile radius,” Schunk said. “If you have a bunch of people in an area drinking, there are going to be people who are committing crimes. If you have hundreds more police officers, then the rate at which those people who are committing even minor nonviolent offensives, there is a higher chance that there will be a police officer nearby.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property. – Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schunk said he agreed the coordinated efforts demonstrated a sense of ownership by I.V. locals for the event.</p>\n<p>“I noticed a lot of cooperation amongst different entities in order to really take ownership of the event and provide structure,” Schunk said. “UCIV, the campus, IVFP, UCPD, and Life of the Party … There was a sense that this was more than just some wild street party that got out of control automatically.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, if this trend of community involvement continues he believes extra policing will not be necessary at future Deltopia weekends.</p>\n<p>“I think even police officers resonated with that and it helped them show a little more restraint,” Schunk said. “I think over time we could see the level of necessary policing decrease more and more as we add in that structure that helps support the event.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said to continue positive progress for a safer Deltopia, he hopes to see more focus on the student volunteer program University of California Isla Vista (UCIV), which helped facilitate Deltopia and the lawful conduction of festivities this past weekend.</p>\n<p>“I think really the thing I would love to see targeted and expanded upon next year is the UCIV program. And the idea of student volunteers,” Schunk said. “The reception generally was incredibly favorable. Countless people came up to us and said, ‘Thank you so much for taking your time today to hand out water bottles.’ People were almost incredulous.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and environmental studies double major Alex Foehr said he understands the need for police action during Deltopia and hopes the event will gradually return to a smaller party meant for I.V. locals.</p>\n<p>“I think the intimidation from the sheer number of police this Deltopia was one of the only benefits of mass law enforcement,” Foehr said. “My 300 person party getting shut down at 3:00 p.m. at the time it seemed unnecessary, but it was for the general welfare and I understand that. I feel that next year’s Deltopia will be more local and back to normal like before the [2014] riots because of this intimidating police presence.”</p>\n<p>Foehr also said he believed the increased police presence had some disadvantages.</p>\n<p>“However, I think there were many disadvantages to this presence. … Festival ordinances, for example, infringe upon some of what I believe to be my fundamental rights to private property,” Foehr said. “Also, it’s a waste of public resources to have so many cops here, just because of irresponsible college kids.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus Nehanda Wells attended Deltopia this past weekend and said she also experienced a run-in with the police, but the incident did not change her opinion on the positive aspects of additional policing.</p>\n<p>“Outside BevMo! … a cop banged on my window and asked to see my ID. I’ve never had that happen before. It was intimidating because I wasn’t doing anything wrong,” Wells said. “I’m not saying that it was a bad thing. I just think that was reaching too far. But as far as having more police here for the weekend, it obviously worked because things were much calmer this year than last year.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62040\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62040\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-06/deltopia-calmer-than-last-years/","id":4748,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[4747,4746,4745],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Researcher Presents Lecture on Mexico’s Kidnapped Students","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ayotzinapa-Talk_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ayotzinapa-Talk_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Principal Researcher of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City Alicia Civera Cerecedo presented a lecture in HSSB on Monday night about the 2014 mass kidnapping of Ayotzinapa students in Ig...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_61270\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61270\" data-attachment-id=\"61270\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-24/researcher-presents-lecture-on-mexicos-kidnapped-students/ayotzinapa-talk_stephen-manga-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ayotzinapa-Talk_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1067&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Alicia Civera Cerecedo (left) tells the story of how the government failed to act during the Ayotzinapa massacre while Gabriela Soto (right) translates.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424664714\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"104\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ayotzinapa Talk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ayotzinapa-Talk_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ayotzinapa-Talk_Stephen-Manga-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61270\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ayotzinapa-Talk_Stephen-Manga-2-1024x683.jpg?resize=750%2C500\" alt=\"Alicia Civera Cerecedo (left) tells the story of how the government failed to act during the Ayotzinapa massacre while Gabriela Soto (right) translates.

Cerecedo discussed the social movement that arose in Mexico after the kidnappings, the history of teacher training schools in Mexico and baseless narratives that are being forced onto teachers’ reputations by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) government in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Sixty percent of the population in Mexico over the age of 15 are in a situation of “lack of education or of not being fully educated,” and people who reside in rural areas have an average education of 6.4 years, according to Cerecedo. She also said Mexican youth are forced to enter cities or migrate to the U.S. because of acute poverty in rural Mexico, and many face challenging economic circumstances and must resort to the drug trade to survive.</p>\n<p>“The civil society is in a state of disbelief and the judicial process day-to-day becomes more apparent that it has been impeded,” said Cerecedo.</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, drug traffickers provide health services and security when the state fails to do so; however the line between government protection and drug cartel protection is becoming increasingly blurred. Cerecedo said drug trafficking is clearly becoming more integrated into the government entity.</p>\n<p>“In the case of Iguala, it became patently clear that drug trafficking is at all levels and in all types of government,” Cerecedo said. “Municipal, state, federal — in the executive, judicial and legislative. In the army as well.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the Mexican government is using corrupt forms of control and abusing their power by projecting societal problems of illiteracy and poverty onto the teachers. Cerecedo said the Mexican media, which is strictly controlled by the PRI regime, also blames teachers for the failures of the education system.</p>\n<p>Chaos surrounding the education system makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly what caused the Ayotzinapa Student Massacre, Cerecedo said.</p>\n<p>“The disappearance of the students happens at a time when you have social conflict and increasing social violence and an economic crisis all coming together,” Cerecedo said. “And it’s at a time when teachers are putting face against PRI authority or challenging the PRI.”</p>\n<p>According to Cerecedo, the PRI came into power two years ago and has since targeted all opposing political parties or ideologies with hostility.</p>\n<p>“[The PRI] identifies all political parties as a political class without ideas,” Cerecedo said, “[They] are distributing power among themselves which results in a lot of corruption.”</p>\n<p>Cerecedo ended the lecture by saying that Mexico’s political system is essentially based on a “Constitution of a political system that no longer guards the people.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor in the history department and event translator Gabriela Soto Laveaga said she hopes the story of the missing students was thought-provoking for students on campus.</p>\n<p>“It’s powerful because … the students who disappeared are your age,” Laveaga said. “I think that’s really poignant. Forty-three people disappeared and were tortured because they were studying.”</p>\n<p>Laveaga said the lecture highlighted to her the vital role student activists play in implementing social change.</p>\n<p>“I think we tend to be really disconnected out here. Sometimes we forget that in most countries its students are the activists,” Laveaga said. “It’s students who are really involved with social change. And maybe Mexico is not that far — it’s our neighbor to our south. And we could be a little more aware of the power of university students in other parts of the world.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Karla Estrada said she attended the event to get a different perspective on the events that unfolded during the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to come to the event because I was aware of the massacre in Iguala and I wanted to get a first-hand account from the professor who is directly from Mexico City,” Estrada said. “She obviously has a really different perspective from professors here in the UC. A lot of my professors talk about what happened, but I felt like I just wanted to get her input.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major Kreg Zaragoza said listening to Cerecedo’s lecture first-hand perspective was akin to receiving “insider information.”<br>\n“It’s good to hear from someone who is actually from Mexico,” Zaragoza said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Protesters then marched the streets and chanted slogans including “Tenants United, Will Never Be Divided!” and “Fight! Fight! Fight! Housing Is A Right.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy major and IVTU Development Director Alejandro Sanchez said the tenants union organized the demonstration in order to bring attention to an issue that he said effects all residents of I.V.</p>\n<p>“Some people might think that we’re just here for the six families, but that’s not necessarily true,” Sanchez said. “The six families are part of the community and as a whole were just trying to help them out. At the end of the day, it’s not just for them. It’s for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar, who attended the march, said the evictions at Abrego Villas are the latest in a history of similar housing issues in I.V.</p>\n<p>“They’ve been doing it for years now and it’s not a new thing, evicting people,” Minoiefar said. “It reflects how the landlords here feel that they can do whatever they want — in terms of rent, in terms of upkeep, everything. Housing issues here are ridiculous. And this is just one of the worst ways in which they abuse their power.”</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology and political science double major Cameron Schunk said outside management companies need to recognize I.V. is not a “lawless” area where tenants’ rights violations can go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>“Where I come from, if people next door were evicted en mass, there would be uproar and there would be protest,” Schunk said. “We’re coming together and saying, ‘Not in our community … You cannot just come here and take advantage of renters. That’s not how it works.’”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60966\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60966\" data-attachment-id=\"60966\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-17/isla-vista-continues-tenants-rights-campaign/ivtu-march-2-13_christine-skari-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=1069%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1069,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IVTU March 2-13_Christine Skari-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60966\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5-684x1024.jpg?resize=400%2C599\" alt=\"Christine Skari/Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IVTU-March-2-13_Christine-Skari-5.jpg?w=1069&amp;ssl=1 1069w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-60966\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christine Skari/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Schunk, student and I.V. resident participation in demonstrations is vital to bringing the evicted tenant situation to justice.</p>\n<p>“Exposing the fact that these things are happening is paramount,” Schunk said. “As well as gathering community interest to fight these occurrences in the future.

Brian Lezak said Majestic complied with all the rules and regulations as outlined in Ordinance 4444 and did not violate any laws.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the facts that have been publicized have been significantly distorted and are not an accurate reflection of each individual’s situation, and we intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak in an email. “We will defend their position in court which is the proper place.”</p>\n<p>According to Lezak, Majestic wants to give back to the I.V. residents by providing apartment housing that is clean and affordable, and the Abrego Villas renovations were in part made to reduce water consumption.</p>\n<p>“The management willingly made additional changes which will also allow the property to use other utilities more efficiently, which again is in support of the conservation goals of Isla Vista and Santa Barbara,” Lezak said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Andrew Prieto said he plans to participate in the picket to support the local community and “make a statement” about what kind of treatment residents are willing to accept from landlords.</p>\n<p>“Those removed from their homes will get the justice and equal treatment they deserve,” Prieto said. “The point of the rally isn’t to attack people or attack the property companies but bring attention to the injustices and hope that attention will foster a change.</p>\n<p>Brandon Baker, an I.V. resident and recent UCSB graduate, said he plans to attend the march to fulfill a desire to create positive change.</p>\n<p>“I just didn’t think it was enough to read about the eviction and sit at home,” Baker said. “I wanted to actually be a part of the movement or process to bring change. We talk about solidarity in Isla Vista, well this is the time to really see what that is.”</p>\n<p>Baker said the Abrego evictions present another example of poor treatment of resident in an environment in which students are already abused by landlords who charge too much for rent in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Rent’s already high enough and I have to buy food and gas and stuff too,” Baker said. “If we let them do this, it sets a precedent for other realtors to do the same thing. I’m already paying a lot of money to live in a shithole. I’ve literally seen my landlord last year pull up in a corvette … Students are being taken advantage of and this brings attention to that unfairness.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said IVTU plans to extend their campaign for fair rights for tenants beyond I.V.</p>\n<p>“We will be working to improve the legislation, working with our partners in the county as well as … working with statewide legislators,” Bogdanov said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, February 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60838\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60838\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/ivtu-to-picket-apt-evictions/","id":4767,"author":{"id":160,"name":"Alyssa Schmidt"},"related":[4766,4765,4764],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/160"}},"__N_SSG":true}
