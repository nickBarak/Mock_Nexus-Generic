Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended its visit to San Diego with a win over No. 22 Marist College, but were defeated by No. 7 Arizona State, No. 14 Loyola Marymount University and No. 13 UC San Diego.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s subpar 1-3 finish, there were some individual standout performances throughout the team’s two days of competition.</p>\n<p>On opening day of the invitational, the Gauchos were led by redshirt senior center Lauren Martin who put away four goals, including a hat trick against the Red Foxes. The Fresno native shot 3-4 to sustain a .581 shooting percentage this season.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, junior utility Taylor Shore was active in stealing the ball, collecting seven on the day— three of which were against the Sun Devils. Complementing Shore was senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw who had nine saves in total and three steals per game.</p>\n<p>However, it was senior attacker Bryn Hudson who took the second day of the invitational with her outstanding work in the pool, finding the back of the net for a combined seven goals, including a team-high of four goals against the Tritons. She also went on to contribute five assists in the second game of the day against LMU.</p>\n<p>“<u></u>Bryn Hudson is tough as nails,” Coach Kay said. “She [Hudson] plays with the same mental toughness no matter who the opponent.  She will continue to make an impact not only as a playmaker but also as a scorer.”</p>\n<p>Brokaw on her part had 12 saves in the first match to go along with two steals. She tallied six saves and a steal in the second contest, but it was not enough to lead the Gauchos to victory as they dropped both games on Sunday.</p>\n<p>With that behind them, the Gauchos will now focus on what is to come this weekend. There are a total of 16 teams participating, which are divided into four separate groups. Santa Barbara is placed in “Group C” along with tough competitors such as No. 3 Cal, No.6 Hawaii, No.12 Pacific.</p>\n<p>The first matchup for UCSB will be Saturday morning against No. 3 Cal. The Bears are 13-1 overall after their solid performance at the UC Davis Invitational in which they defeated No. 12 Pacific and Brown University. Cal will look to extend its current nine-match winning streak.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos faced the Bears earlier this season in an intense game that went into overtime. A goal by sophomore driver Carla Carrega in the last seven seconds of the match clinched the Bears’ second chance, forcing the game into its extra period. It was in overtime where Cal finished the game to defeat Santa Barbara by a score of 9-8.</p>\n<p>“We have now played 4 OT games so far this season and I believe if we are resilient these games will teach lessons in big moments come Big West Championship time,” Coach Kay said. “This is what we have been focusing on to prepare for this coming weekend where every game in the tournament will be a fight to the final buzzer.”</p>\n<p>The biggest threat to the Gauchos will once again be Carrega, who is responsible for most of the Golden Bears’ scoring so far this season. The sophomore currently ranks third in the MPSF in scoring, averaging 2.21 goals per game and is second in total goals scored with 31.</p>\n<p>Apart from the sophomore driver, providing the Bears with productive play are Dora Antal and Anna Illes, who will both participate in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, after their outstanding performances with Hungary in the 2016 European Championships last month.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the UCSB vs. Cal rematch will be an exciting match to watch, and also an important one. The result of the match will dictate who the Gauchos will face in its next match on Sunday, Feb. 28.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos take on the Bears at 10:30 a.m. at Corona del Mar High School this Saturday, Feb. 27.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, UCSB is aware that this will be no easy game.</p>\n<p>“Marist is a good team from the MAAC conference with a handful of international players along with a dominant force in the paint,” Coach Kay said. “They defeated SDSU in Michigan 8-6 and are expected to be a tough competitor.”</p>\n<p>The Red Foxes count on freshman utility Katie Tijerina who was named Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Women’s Water Polo Defensive Player of the Week and freshman Susan Cantoni was named MAAC Rookie of the Week after their outstanding performance at the Brown Bruno Invitational.</p>\n<p>Tijerina had three drawn ejections this past weekend along with 10 steals and one field block in four matches against No. 4 Hawaii. Cantoni contributed four goals, five assists, one steal and two field blocks this weekend.</p>\n<p>In order to fair well against the No. 21 team in the country it will be important for the Gauchos to be able to play great defense, something they have been focusing on all week.</p>\n<p>“The main focus was transition defense.” Coach Kay said.</p>\n<p>This will be critical to help the Gauchos avoid going into another overtime match, or even to maintain a lead.</p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the pool, Santa Barbara is very efficient in taking advantage of the first couple of possessions in the game and of power plays.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s team counts on impactful individuals such as senior center Lauren Martin who has led the team in scoring with 18 goals. Martin scored the winning goal in the sudden death overtime match against Hartwick at the Michigan Invitational. That weekend she finished with seven goals including a career high for goals scored in a single game with four.</p>\n<p>Senior attacker Bryn Hudson and junior utilities Miranda Schrader and Taylor Shore have also helped accounting for a combined 33 goals.

It was junior defender Sophie Trabucco who opened up the scoreboard at the <span data-term=\"goog_343243779\">7:00</span> mark. However, the Hawks quickly responded with three consecutive goals from Katie McKenty, LJ Edwards, and Lauren Brennan.</p>\n<p>Hartwick once again came out strong in the second quarter and went on another 3-1 run putting them in the lead 6-3 with three minutes left in the half. UCSB executed on consecutive possessions shortening the Hawks lead, but the Hawks found the back of the cage in the last second to take them into half time with a two score lead.</p>\n<p>The second half of the game was a constant battle for the Gauchos who tied the score in two occasions, only to have Hartwick reclaim their lead shortly after. With little time left on the clock, Santa Barbara turned to senior center Lauren Martin who scored 21 seconds after the Hawks had gained a two-goal lead, and was followed by junior attacker Brenna Thomas on a power play to tie the game.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB’s senior attacker Bryn Hudson scored first in overtime, Brittany Tait would give the Hawks another chance by forcing the game into sudden death. This was the first time Santa Barbara had gone into sudden death so far in the season.</p>\n<p>It was Martin who won the sprint to give UCSB the first possession, in which she capitalized with the winning goal after 21 seconds to finish 15-14.</p>\n<p>The second game of the day proved to be just as challenging for the Gauchos who came out on top after another overtime game against Pacific.</p>\n<p>Carrying on the momentum from the first match, Martin scored back-to-back goals to start the game. The Tigers found the back of the net on three occasions to end the first quarter in a tie.</p>\n<p>Junior utility Taylor Shore reclaimed the lead at the start of the second period, scoring on her own rebound after her shot had gone off the post the first time.</p>\n<p>The Tigers had a comeback in the second quarter. For the first time in the game they took the lead after a penalty shot taken by Rachel Krieger. Pacific was now on top with a two-goal lead by the halftime break.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos quickly came back and tied the game within the first minute of the third period with the help of Thomas who set up senior utility Samantha Murphy and Martin on back-to-back possessions.</p>\n<p>The seesaw battle carried on to the last period, in what looked like the Tigers would pull off the win after scoring with only 38 seconds left. But the Gauchos drew an ejection foul and took advantage on their last possession, with Shore scoring the equalizer with 13 seconds left on the clock.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored first in overtime with Shore assisting Martin, followed by freshman defender Kristen Denney to end the first OT period. The tigers tried to fight back, but their goal from Ellen Tiedmann was retaliated by junior utility Miranda Schrader securing the win for the Gauchos, 13-11.</p>\n<p>Martin finished the day with a total of seven goals, including a team-high of four goals against Pacific making it the second game in the season in which she collects that many. Contributing to the day’s success were Hudson, Schrader, and Thomas with four goals of their own.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos split the final day of the invitational falling to No. 7 Michigan, the top ranked team in the tournament, in a 14-8 loss and another nail biter win over No. 15 San Diego State.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines scored the first goal of the game, but were answered by Thomas to put UCSB on the board. Although the Gauchos scored once again, they also allowed two goals sending them into the second quarter behind Michigan 4-2.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara scored on three occasions in the second quarter, two of them coming from Murphy, but Michigan put away four unanswered goals to stay on top.</p>\n<p>The 11-5 lead by the Wolverines proved to be too much for the Gauchos despite two goals by sophomore utility Camila Schafer and Kreiser. Michigan sealed the deal with three more goals to end the game with a six-point deficit.</p>\n<p>The final game of the weekend resulted in a 9-8 victory over SDSU.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs got on the board first, but their lead only lasted 12 seconds thanks to a hat trick delivered by Murphy. The Gauchos would then go on a 3-0 run, including two from Murphy. San Diego put away three of its own, but were unable to take the lead ending the first period trailing UCSB 4-3.</p>\n<p>Although the second half of the game fluctuated between a one or two point difference, the Gauchos never let SDSU tie it up.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara went into the final quarter up 8-6, but the Aztecs found the back of the net at the <span data-term=\"goog_343243780\">6:11</span> mark putting them within one point.</p>\n<p>Thomas scored the last goal for the Gauchos, and although Tayla Walsh responded to it, it was not enough to come out on top.</p>\n<p>Defense took care of the remainder of the game not allowing any more goals from the Aztecs and senior goalkeeper MacKenzie Broakaw recording a late-game save.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will resume play on February 13<sup>th</sup> at the Triton Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Alberta native kicked off her collegiate career with an outstanding performance at the LouStrong Invitational, scoring 19 goals in her first four games.</p>\n<p>Christmas helped the Canadian U-19 team to third place at the 2014 Pan Am games and was the top scorer at the Worlds Hungary Tournament.</p>\n<p>On Sunday the Gauchos will play against No. 7 Michigan in the afternoon and No.15 SDSU at night.</p>\n<p>The Wolverines finished with an overall 3-2 record in their appearance at the UCSB Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Michigan swept the weekly awards with senior attacker Ali Thomason who received CWPA Player of the Week after tallying 19 goals, two assists, four steals and 17-of-19 sprints won. The Defensive Player of the Week went to senior goalkeeper Julia Campbell, who had 35 saves, and the Rookie of the Week was awarded to freshman defender Kim Johnson who managed to put 12 away.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will wrap up the weekend with No.15 SDSU, who will play its first games of the year in this tournament.</p>\n<p>The reigning back-to-back Golden Coast Conference regular season champions have four returning All-American players, including Caroline Israels.</p>\n<p>The junior utility was named GCC Co-Player of the Year and earned ACWPC Honorable Mention All-American last season. With 61 goals, 53 steals and 18 assists, she finished second in the GCC for goals scored.</p>\n<p>Having played against top-notch competition last weekend gives the Gauchos a bit of an advantage for the upcoming games, especially since two of them have yet to see action this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Hartwick at 3:40 p.m. followed by Pacific at 5:50 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67621\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67621\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/womens-water-polo-preview/","id":5012,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5011,5010,5009],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 13 Gauchos Close Out Winter Invitational at 3-2, Losses to No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 Cal","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JoseOchoa-WWaterPolo-1-23-16-2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JoseOchoa-WWaterPolo-1-23-16-2-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Despite falling to No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 Cal, the UCSB women's water polo team finished its Winter Invitational with a 3-2 record.

The game went back and forth as Cal evened the score at the 4:10 mark only to be answered by Martin’s backhand scoring play, putting the Gauchos in the lead 5-4.</p>\n<p>As the battle continued, UCSB was able to contain the Bears’ offense until the last seven seconds of regulation when Carrega tied the match sending it into overtime.</p>\n<p>The first period of overtime went on scoreless, and it wasn’t until the 1:31 mark of the second period when the Bears found the winning goal by junior driver Genevieive Weed.</p>\n<p>On the second day of the tournament, the Gauchos played Cal Baptist in the afternoon with junior utility Taylor Shore, senior attacker Bryn Hudson and Martin each scoring two goals each.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defense remained strong as it held off the Lancers, keeping them scoreless until midway of the second quarter, which by that point the Gauchos were already up 5-0. At the 4:42 mark Cal Baptist scored its first goal of the match, but was quickly answered by freshman utility Sarah Kreiser to maintain the five-point lead.</p>\n<p>Although the Lancers scored two more in the fourth quarter to shorten the lead 9-4, the Gauchos put one more away to end the game in a 10-4 victory.</p>\n<p>Later that night, UCSB faced its toughest competitor of the tournament, the UCLA Bruins. Despite having scored first, the Gauchos were not able to maintain its lead as the Bruins went on a 5-0 unanswered scoring streak.</p>\n<p>“I think we are countering well and we got good patience, something to improve on is reacting quicker on defense,” Kay said postgame.</p>\n<p>The first quarter ended with UCLA on top 3-1, which carried its momentum into the second quarter scoring within the period’s first minute. Although the Gauchos had the opportunity to strike back, they did not capitalize on the two back-to-back offensive fouls committed by the Bruins.</p>\n<p>Following the second period, the Gauchos managed to score two more goals, reducing their deficit to 6-3 to which the Bruins reacted quickly.</p>\n<p>Despite UCSB’s efforts to catch up, UCLA did not give up the three-point lead ending the game 8-5 with a victory for the Bruins.</p>\n<p>“It is always fun to play against UCLA for me, those were my glory days and it is always a blast,” Kay said after facing her alma mater.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the Gauchos wrapped up its Winter Invitational with a sweep over No.21 UCSD and No.20 Wagner.</p>\n<p>The Tritons were looking to finish the weekend with a perfect record in the first game of the day. However, after an intense seesaw game the Gauchos spoiled it for UCSD finishing on top 10-9.</p>\n<p>Both teams came out slow in the first quarter, and couldn’t seem to find the net. The Tritons opened up the board with a goal at the 5:26 mark to which the Gauchos counter attacked and scored a point to end the first quarter in a tie.</p>\n<p>Things got going in the second quarter as both teams scored a couple of goals, finishing the first half of the game with UCSB leading 5-4.</p>\n<p>It was an exciting fourth quarter in which the Tritons would fight back and tie the game on three separate occasions. Two of these were penalty shots from Alexia Wieseler.</p>\n<p>Unable to surpass a one-point lead, UCSB was aware of the importance to keep possession of the ball for as long as it could. After Schrader tallied a goal, the Gauchos held on to the ball and let the clock run to end the game with a close win over the Tritons.</p>\n<p>Despite a long weekend, the Gauchos remained focused and strong in their last game against Wagner. Great work on both ends of the pool helped defeat the Seahawks, 10-6.</p>\n<p>UCSB did not lose any time and put away two scores within the first minute and a half. The biggest lead came in the third quarter as the Gauchos held Wagner down 7-2.<br>\nAfter that, the Gauchos did not allow the Seahawks to get closer than three points.</p>\n<p>Senior goalkeeper Mackenzie Brokaw recorded a season-high of 15 saves during the game while Shore ended the day as UCSB’s leading scorer with five goals. Martin had six ejections total and three steals to contribute to the Gauchos’ total of 15.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy with the team’s performance,” Kay said. “I really think we are playing with the best, but we still have a lot of areas to polish up, like technical skills and simple awareness.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue their season on the road, as they head to Ann Arbor for the Michigan Invitational this upcoming weekend.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67622\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67622\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-25/no-13-gauchos-close-out-winter-invitational-at-3-2-losses-to-no-2-ucla-and-no-4-cal/","id":5011,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5010,5009,5008],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos to Host Nation’s Top Teams in Winter Invitational","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-7-2015_9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-7-2015_9-web.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"A total of 11 Top-25 teams will participate in the UCSB Winter Invitational, starting Friday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_67481\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67481\" data-attachment-id=\"67481\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/camila-schafer-passes-the-ball-to-a-teammate-christina-demarzodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WomensWaterPolo_ChristinaDeMarzo_11-7-2015_9-web.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Camila Schafer passes the ball to a teammate.

After an overall record of 14-16 in 2015, the Gauchos were ranked No.14 in the NCAA’s preseason poll for the second consecutive year, but managed to move up a spot in the standings.</p>\n<p>Participating in the invitational are also 11 other top-25 nationally ranked schools, including national powerhouses No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 Cal.</p>\n<p>Last year was full of adjustments as Santa Barbara welcomed new Head Coach Serela Kay to its program. Under her wing, two Gauchos, senior attacker Bryn Hudson and sophomore utility Camila Schafer, received Big West honorable mentions, while senior utility Samantha Murphy earned All-Big West Second Team honors.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This season, the Gauchos look to continue their improvement with the help of a new addition to their coaching staff, assistant coach Sierra Peltcher.</p>\n<p>Coach Peltcher joined the staff last fall, after a year as assistant coach for Santa Barbara City College women’s water polo program. During her time there, she helped the Vaqueros reach the Western State Conference championship and the quarterfinals of the So Cal Regional, in which they held an 8-1 record. In her coaching career she has worked with athletes like four-time Olympian Terry Shroeder, USA goalkeeper Merrill Moses as well as US Men’s National Water Polo team captain Tony Azevedo.</p>\n<p>After a close 10-9 overtime win over Long Beach State, the Gauchos finished in fifth-place at the Big West Conference Tournament last year. In 2016, UCSB will try to improve its 3-4 conference play record with the help of returning players like Mackenzie Brokaw, Murphy and young talent like freshman utility Sarah Kreiser.</p>\n<p>Now a senior goalkeeper, Brokaw had an outstanding last year as she finished the season with a total of 161 saves and a season-high of 13 goals against UC Irvine. Her 5.04 goals against average ranks first all-time, as it was a new Big West single-season record.</p>\n<p>As for Murphy, who scored 34 goals and had 24 assists in 30 games, she also received Honorable Mention-All American recognition by the ACWPC for the second time in three years. She currently ranks fifth in Gaucho history with 129 goals.</p>\n<p>Along with its veteran players, it can be expected that UCSB will showcase its young talent throughout the season. Much attention will be provided to the performance of freshman utility Kreiser, who was named First Team All-CIF and earned her third consecutive First Team All-Sea View League award while at Trabuco Hills High School.  Kreiser led her high school team with 100 goals and 101 steals her senior year, including a season-high 10 steals in two games. She was named Female Athlete of the Year by her former school, which was based on both her athletic and academic achievements.</p>\n<p>UCSB will host Cal to begin its season this Friday at 2:10 p.m. at Campus Pool. The Gauchos are set to face Cal Baptist and UCLA in a doubleheader on Saturday, facing the Lancers first at 12:30 p.m. then the Bruins at 6 p.m. at the Rec Cen. Santa Barbara will close out its weekend with two final matches versus No. 21 UC San Diego at 12:10 p.m. and No. 20 Wagner at 4:20 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 21, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67525\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67525\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/gauchos-to-host-nations-top-teams-in-winter-invitational/","id":5010,"author":{"id":322,"name":"Sinead Leon"},"related":[5009,5008,5007],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/322"}},"__N_SSG":true}
