Artists like Pharrell Williams, for example, who seem to have production credits and contributions all over in pop culture, are rarely cited for their actual solo work, becoming (unfairly) more of an image than a powerful solo musician. Toro Y Moi has often been placed into this strange and often inaccurate box of music culture; he’s been seemingly everywhere across genre and style and influence. Any music fan can recognize his face and fashion, yet strangely enough, he is not praised for his music to the same degree that he should be. Despite all of this, Chaz Bear, more frequently known as Toro Y Moi, proves through his live presence and energy that he is a great performer despite these constraints, standing alone as not only an iconic image but also a major influence and pioneer of 21st century indie music.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toro Y Moi hit downtown Santa Barbara’s SOhO last Thursday for a stop on his tour following his </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boo Boo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album release and after announcing a new album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outer Peace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is coming early 2019. With a long, successful career and a ton of commercial buzz, Chaz beautifully arrived on stage, maintaining a delicate balance of high energy and chill waves and prompting one of the danciest crowds I’ve ever seen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chaz began his set with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boo Boo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> album opener “Mirage,” which was met with a strong response from the audience. The energy didn’t reach full potential, however, until he performed his new single, “Freelance,” soon after, which seemed to be the true start of the night. Toro himself was alternating between keys, a beat pad and solo vocals, meshing seamlessly with his incredibly rehearsed backing band. Sonically, things were just about perfect, with the vocal reverb balanced exactly as it is on record and instrumentation that was clean and vibrant.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

This moment in particular marked some of the highest audience involvement, with nearly everyone singing along to the catchy hook and dancing with the grooves. Despite the electronic-heavy landscape of “Boo Boo,” the live setting translated alarmingly well, with every 808 drum, groovy baseline and synth chord hitting hard and true. Much of the magic that Chaz Bear presents here lies in turning his recorded dreams into a live reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In person, Toro Y Moi was about as quaint and down-to-earth as I had imagined. He was a man of few words between songs and seemed to say more in performance than anything else. His movement and engagement were limited, yet effective, which made for a very intimate and immersive show. This mysterious and somewhat reclusive element of Toro is a bit of a staple of his image, and it proved extremely effective once paired with the strong backing band and lighting choreography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the more exciting moments mid-set came from Toro’s early classic album, 2013’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything in Return</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some of these deeper cuts worked as a nod to his more dedicated fans and provided a change of pace from the other tracks in the set. Moving emotional tracks like “Say That” and “So Many Details” were memorable moments at SOhO, and they personally took me back to my high school days when </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything in Return</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was first released. Toro Y Moi wrapped up his set with classic hit “Rose Quartz,” a track that is lodged in the memory of any true fan of Chaz’s music and one that marked the start of a huge career. The performance was extremely powerful in its nostalgic nature and celebratory tone, ending the night where a lot of Toro’s fans began with him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toro Y Moi is a total icon, not only in image and cultural positioning but also in diverse musicianship, intimate performative value and sheer, raw talent. If a look into his discography doesn’t prove this, surely some time in his live setting will. After an incredibly fun and ultimately moving night at SOhO, I can assure you that Toro Y Moi isn’t going anywhere but forward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84827\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/toro-y-moi-is-blissed-out-at-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84827\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/toro-y-moi-is-blissed-out-at-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/toro-y-moi-is-blissed-out-at-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/toro-y-moi-is-blissed-out-at-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/toro-y-moi-is-blissed-out-at-soho/","id":6607,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6606,6605,6604],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Miguel Closes Out Summer at SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Miguel-SB-Bowl_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Miguel-SB-Bowl_Jenny-Luo_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The stage presence of Miguel is articulate and precise, alarmingly reminiscent of the way Michael Jackson used to move about the stage and command his audience’s attention. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the first day of school at UCSB just around the corner, many Santa Barbarans chose to wrap up the summer with a night of innovative,  latin-inspired pop music from Miguel and his openers at the gorgeous outdoor venue of the Santa Barbara Bowl. With support from Nonchalant Savant and OVO signee DVSN, this performance from Miguel’s “The Ascension Tour” was as rehearsed, focused and high-energy as possible, with clear precision and performative value that is practiced, methodical and passionate. This show from Miguel demands acknowledgement of the strength in his entire discography and his long future to come in the music industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DVSN took the stage in preparation for Miguel, and the simple stage setup of three background singers and vocalist Daniel Daley with a mic set the focus solely on vocal prowess, something that Dvsn is very akin to. He performed a wide array of tracks from his three projects, showcasing his extremely wide range of vocal ability, namely his gorgeously high falsetto voice. Midway through his set, Dvsn had his DJ play some classic 90s R&amp;B for the crowd to dance to, which seemingly was a highlight but came off as a cheaper attempt to gain attention from the audience. Despite this, DVSN’s stage presence is undeniable, and the OVO wave of R&amp;B seems to be in good hands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miguel took the stage around 9:15 with a full band, backup singers and a staircase set in the middle of the stage, in alignment with other variations of Ascension to come. He opened with various cuts from new album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> including “Banana Clip” and “Harem,” all performed with instrumental variations and a free range of vocal runs. The rock-inspired electric guitar elements in his music play a much bigger role in a live context, as the sharp riffs cut through the air and added powerful sound to the performance. Miguel would later explain that the set is divided into three stages, ending in full ascension in which him and the audience “skywalk,” concluding with his career’s biggest hit, “Sky Walker.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

He had constant choreographed dance moves along to the beat of his tracks and with background dancers behind him. The consistent jumps, hip movements and flails in sync with drum fills, guitar licks and beat switch-ups were crisp, clean and exciting. He began to lose momentum, however, whenever he addressed the crowd directly. His constant rambling about “energy,” “meditation” and the “spirituality” of his performance came off as baseless, as Miguel’s image has always been more lighthearted and transparent as a neo-pop artist. Also, his constant priming of the audience for the performance of “Skywalker” seemed to be a ploy for audience attention. Frequently asking the crowd “Are you guys ready to Skywalk?” after every few songs seemed to have the opposite effect from what was intended. Despite this, the purely musical aspects of the performance were impeccable, with strong instrumentation, vocals and choreography.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later in the set Miguel played a variety of older cuts from previous albums such as sex anthem “Arch and Point,” hit single “Adorn,” the self critique “So I Lied” and the revered, albeit controversial track “Do You…” (like drugs?). In cautious fashion, Miguel made a point to follow up the latter track with a disclaimer that all drugs should be done safely and in moderation, a slightly cringeworthy yet necessary message, given the state of drug use in popular music today. I assumed, as I’m sure many in the crowd did, that Miguel would take some time to honor past collaborator Mac Miller after his passing, but unfortunately that moment was not taken during the performance. This functions as evidence that, in the midst of growing older and more mature, Miguel has been at a crossroads in navigating his image of edgy sex and drug icon and his wise creative persona, and he may not know what kind of image he wants to sell at this point in his career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The set ended with more cuts from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the Kali Uchis Spanish cut “Carmelo Duro” and dreamy landscape “Pineapple Skies.” He concluded his set, as predicted by himself and the audience, with his mega-hit “Sky Walker,” a moment that perhaps felt reduced after the previous hour of hyping it up. Regardless, the track was performed elegantly and with maximum response from the crowd, as “Sky Walker” marks one of the most energetic and fun songs of Miguel’s career.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was more than pleased with the celebration of music, maturity and freedom that Miguel delivered at the Santa Barbara Bowl. Despite some flaws in his monologue and constant references to “Sky Walking,” the entire crowd was happy with his musical execution. Miguel is clearly aware of his talent and potential and will not hesitate to utilize these to the fullest of his ability. As the tour name suggests, Miguel has nowhere to go but up.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

–– are artists delightfully worthwhile and arguably matching in talent, known as the sleepers. Perhaps the most “slept on,” or often unrecognized of this group of unsung talent is the dark horse of pop, the Latin response to American music, Miguel. Coming off of an incredibly focused and high energy fourth project “War and Leisure,” from 2017, Miguel has been on the road as of late for his “Ascension Tour,” of North America. The tour, presumably named with relation to his hit single “Sky Walker,” has already worked its’ way West across the United States, and will be hitting the Santa Barbara Bowl this Friday the 21st. After a year of touring off of his recent success, and with special guest DVSN along the way for this stretch, the SB Bowl stage is set for a wavy end to the summer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miguel first rose to prominence in 2010 with his debut studio album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All I Want is You</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which was met with positive critical acclaim and common recognition of Miguel as one of R&amp;B’s up and comers. His next album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaleidoscope Dream</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which came two years later, further cemented Miguel as a force to be reckoned with in music, and even earned him a Grammy for the projects opening track “Adorn.” It wasn’t until his 2014 strong shift </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wildheart</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, that he really earned universal recognition for his artistry and creative bravery. A highlight in his career, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wildheart</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was much more raw, edgy, electronic, and gritty than any of his previous work. The album was released behind a multitude of daunting singles, including the rock influenced “Hollywood Dreams,” and upbeat dream hit “coffee,” also paired with a Wale remix appropriately titled “Coffee (F***ing)”. It also featured hit track “the valley,” a raw and deeply sexual pulse that feels reminiscent of Nine Inch Nails “Closer.” The haunting 808’s and intense lyrical imagery throughout worked to function as a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeezus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-esque mark to his discography, taking a sharp but poignant left turn musically and proving the diversity of the promising musician.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This of course leads us to Miguel’s most recent work which is by far his most positive, dreamy, and refined of his career, the feel good answer to his darkness of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wildheart</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the 2017 powerhouse of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">War and Leisure</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Luckily for those who know what’s what, Ariel Pink hit SOhO last week with openers DIIV and Savage Henry to bring some of those underground vibes to the Santa Barbara audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A prominent figure in indie music for nearly two decades, Ariel Pink is known for his mysteriously large amount of recorded content and his unique lo-fi aesthetic. He is an L.A. icon that is always a treat in the rare moments he performs live. Coming off of his 2017 homage </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which received widespread acclaim from critics, Ariel Pink is hitting the road in multiple countries and has brought DIIV along for some of the stops.

Thompson reference Savage Henry also opened the night off with some heavy rock tunes before DIIV and Ariel Pink dismantled the stage. As someone who has seen this band many times in quite a few local sweaty backyards, I can personally attest to the talent and drive of this band. Their performance was tons of fun and featured a group of very likeable and talented musicians. Although it may appear easy to doubt the tangible potential for industry success in these hot local Isla Vista bands, no one can deny their talent and poise, and the opening for legend Ariel Pink is no dismissable task.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1140889214\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83329\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83333\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-25/ariel-pink-and-diiv-were-indie-as-fuck-at-soho/the-real-savage-henry-soho-siavash_ghadiri-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Real Savage Henry @SOhO Siavash_Ghadiri (2)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83333\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Real-Savage-Henry-@SOhO-Siavash_Ghadiri-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DIIV was a clearly effective primer for Ariel Pink’s performance as the more mellow atmospheric sounds and elaborate light set provided a spacy backdrop for the night. I have seen DIIV play excellently before, and their SOhO set was no different. Their instrumentals nailed their usual perfect blend of clean and ambient with just the right amount of reverb and all cues were executed as cleanly as ever. A talented group that has played together for a long time, this set was clearly not their first, as hits such as “Dopamine,” “Doused” and, of course, “Under the Sun,” were executed effortlessly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After chilling out at the patio in the afterglow of DIIV, my friend and I moved up close to catch the man of the hour, the mastermind himself, Ariel Pink in all of his weird glory. After a beautiful musical blur of over an hour, I can now say in full confidence that Ariel Pink was very weird and very glorious. His presence was all that I could have imagined –– plus more that I could never have –– with beautifully strange and staggered stage presence, intense and clearly visible passion, an extremely cohesive backing band and just a shitton of high quality jams.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83331\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

ever seen, sporting a half-cut hairstyle with one side long and one side short, jean shorts that went far above his knees and a classic striped “Guess Jeans” t-shirt. With a mic full of stylistic reverb and distortion, Pink strutted and poured over his lo-fi instrumentals like no one else. His opening tunes included some standouts from his newest work, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as most of his stops on the tour has revolved around the album. Some of the earlier plays included aggressive punk era thrasher “Time to Meet Your God,” and ambient pop landscape “Bubblegum Dreams.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The later parts of his set included more selections from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to Bobby Jameson</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as “Feels Like Heaven,” “I Wanna Be Young” and standout late night ballad “Another Weekend,” which was arguably the highlight of the night. The mellowed-out reflective change of pace gave a moment of breathing room for the audience as Pink crooned over a dreamy backdrop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The L.A. recluse also provided some deeper cuts from his repertoire as expected with someone of his lengthy and deep discography. Some other cuts included “Lipstick,” from 2014 project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pom pom</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and pop ballad “Baby,” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mature Themes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Pink also included a number of tracks from his 2006 classic album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">House Arrest</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the title track as well as “Hardcore Pops are Fun,” that his backup singer pretenced with “There’s glam pop, and then there’s hardcore pop!” Such a simple yet important statement effectively summarized the cultural pull of Ariel Pink as a genre bender and musical journey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After stepping off for a quick encore after an electrifying set, Ariel Pink came back out to finish with “House Arrest,” standout “Netherlands” and end with “Bobby Jameson,” B-side “Ode to the Goat,” which came as a thank you to us as an audience as well as a thank you to his inspirations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall the set was incredible with almost 20 tracks performed, all with intense personality and emotion. It seemed to fly by with quick transitions and intoxicating daze, and the man himself proved to be an absolute great and a symbol in the world of music. Ariel Pink is someone I will surely see again in the future and has opened up my eyes to the full extent and range of his work. A door was opened that gracefully pushes some more casual fans to explore just everything that this lasting artist has to offer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ariel Pink is a mystery, an icon and indie as fuck. He has ever-expanding layers of depth and art that reach farther than most people can really know, and even knowing a little bit about him is equal to knowing nothing at all. Perhaps he is not from our time or planet, though he is equal parts future, past and present. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His live presence was everything we could have expected and more. It was enigmatic, it was borderline insane and it was, for lack of a better term, Ariel Pink as fuck. Last Thursday personally marked one of the most memorable and immersive concert experiences of my entire life, as a living legend proved his extensive and everlasting prominence.</span></p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_83330\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

Isla Vista, you now and again need a musical change of pace. The occasional backyard concert can often give you a solid alternative fix, but eventually, after one too many Red Hot Chili Peppers covers, you’ll probably need to hit the road for some refreshing higher quality tunes. If you were feeling this way last Wednesday, the game plan was then, of course, to head to SOhO and violently mosh to SadGirl and The Drums until physically impossible. I personally opted to choose this option last week, and, as the sea of drunken sweaty bodies around me could attest, it was a great call. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Drums and other indie, surf-rock bands of the same nature have a general reputation for this kind of silly debauchery in the live setting. Last Wednesday was no different in SOhO’s smaller intimate space. The crowd looked like a typical Observatory OC or Burger Records type demographic, mainly LA-inspired college kids with a hint of hip older fans peppered in. My friends and I luckily cruised in just in time for a very pleasant surprise to start the night, the captivating and energetic performance from opener SadGirl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SadGirl’s set was refreshing and clean to a point where I felt rude and inferior in comparison to the rest of the crowd for not knowing who they were earlier. With a vibe very reminiscent of The Drums’ lo-fi aesthetic, they primed the stage perfectly for the rest of the night. Their simple, three-man lineup of guitar, drums and bass easily filled the room with indie sounds that did not fail to give the crowd a great time. This band shows a ton of potential to me be a landmark band in the indie scene, much like The Growlers, Twin Peaks and of course, The Drums are today. It was a pleasure to catch such a likeable and promising act early, especially given that I had previously known nothing about what was to come. A few moshes and subtle layers of sweat later, and the whole crowd and myself were ready for the chaotic follow up of The Drums.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Drums were, as the headline may allude, everything I expected and more. It was so simultaneously beautiful and hectic that it personally left me at a sensory crossroad that I haven’t felt in a long time, probably only comparable to Nine Inch Nails’ iconic comeback set at FYF 2017. The term “organized chaos,” although played out, immediately comes to mind when looking back, as the juxtaposition of the crazy violent moshing crowd and the elegant, crisp, and well rehearsed performance on stage weirdly enough worked perfectly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They came out to a classic track from their album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portamento,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “What You Were,” starting the set off strong and recognizing their long term, dedicated fans. As you have probably figured out by now, the audience was insane, pushing and moving and dancing like a bomb was just dropped on the crowd. I know this is being described excessively, but looking back, this excessiveness is extremely necessary — given how much god damn fun this show really was.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band’s stage presence was impeccable, as the beautiful light display provided a vibrant and encapsulating silhouette for lead singer Jonny Pierce’s elegant dancing around the microphone. The instrumentation was as clean as ever, with every cue followed perfectly and every transition executed excellently. This band is no stranger to the live setting, and even a between Coachella stop at SOhO was performed with the highest precision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Drums followed up their opener with familiar jams “Days” and “Money” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portamento</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and “Hart Basel” from their most recent 2017 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abysmal Thoughts</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The set featured a good mix of old and new hits, all of which flowed seamlessly, considering the cohesive and consistent discography of the band. The set featured a wide array of The Drums’ discography, but generally favored their more recent work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The band wrapped up with their newest single, and possibly biggest and most powerful track, “Blood Under My Belt,” before leaving the stage briefly before an encore. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pierce’s crooning words “I still love you, I love you, I still do,” hit much harder in the live setting, providing a backdrop for one of the most gorgeous mosh pits I have ever personally witnessed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the crowd chanted excitedly for a return for one more song, the band came back out to end the night with another Drums’ classic “Down By the Water,” dating back all the way to their 2010 self-titled debut album. This last song choice seemed perfect in the moment, as a nod back to their roots in an intimate and a slowed down moment of meditation with their supporters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love indie rock, and I greatly appreciate The Drums and their influence in modern music, but I don’t often get to have live experiences quite like this one. Last Wednesday at SOhO was such a great change of pace — so gorgeous, so hectic, and so much fun. Nights like these show that not every concert experience has to be monumental or some life changing experience, but instead, can just be a really kickass time. The Drums gave downtown Santa Barbara a brilliantly wild escape from home, as I hope they continue to give people for many years to come. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/i-saw-the-drums-at-soho-and-it-was-aggressively-gorgeous/","id":6638,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6637,6636,6635],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Donald Glover’s Surreal World of Atlanta","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2018-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FullSizeRender-2.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FullSizeRender-2.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Atlanta” is nothing like any TV show the world has ever seen before.

Moments like these ring true amidst the unthinkable events happening around the characters and similarly set a new contextual lens for the audience to perceive those events. Donald Glover’s self-written, -acted and -produced passion-project “Atlanta”is amazing at doing this exact thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show contains countless ridiculous instances for the main characters, including but not limited to a shooting, a black, Christian Justin Bieber, a fourth-grader wearing white face, wringing out a baby’s diapers to try to pass a drug test, buying drugs from the Migos and, in the season two premiere, Katt Williams holding an alligator in his bathroom. Despite this and constant hilarious scenes of humor, the most important and lasting moments of “Atlanta” are just that: moments. Little quotes, particular song choices, landscapes and stylistic anomalies all add up to one of the most brilliant shows our generation has ever seen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glover and his team have meticulously made very specific and keen decisions here to produce an incredibly funny, intelligent, clever and — for lack of a better word — woke piece of televised artistry. These decisions contribute to a powerful message of race, gender, poverty and struggle that is extremely crucial to the surrounding culture. With both Golden Globes and Emmys under its belt, “Atlanta” is definitely the show to watch right now and is the show that our divided culture needs now more than ever before.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While revolutionary film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Out” breaks ground in presenting the black experience in an all-white context, “Atlanta” finds success in presenting the black experience in a black context, where deadbeat intellectual Earn observes the broken institution around him and asks real questions. Following Earn and his on-the-rise rapper cousin Al — also known as Paper Boi — the general theme of the show is that their environment throws them curveballs and they react accordingly. For reference, the best model of this comes in the pilot when you see Glover’s face after his white friend says the “N”-word. Although I personally cannot relate, I imagine that the constant events like these are used in the show to accurately demonstrate the modern black experience: a lot of bad things happening and a lot of questions. And Glover asks all the right questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In episode two, while in the police station awaiting bail, we see this kind of passive intellect in action. Arguments and anecdotes happen all around Earn, and later, when he sees a deranged homeless person beaten by police, he says, “Why is he in here every week? He looks like he needs help.” In the finale to season one, we see Al show the same kind of confusion after he witnesses a drug dealer get shot and killed by police; “Ya’ll really need all them bullets man?” In these instances of an unconventionally passive main character, the audience begins to see the power of the environment of Atlanta and the sad truth about agency in the people of these communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the show’s most powerful moments, however, we can see the characters in “Atlanta” giving us some answers. Paper Boi’s talk show mic drop in season one, episode seven shakes “Atlanta” to its core when he rants, “Caitlyn Jenner is just doing what rich white men been doin since the dawn of time, which is whatever the hell he want.” Later, in episode nine, the tension builds to Earn’s glorious rant at the plot’s climax, where he erupts on Vanessa’s mom and stepdad. In a satisfying storm of words, Earn snapped to the white stepdad, “Stop stunting on me about my culture. I’m not gonna go back to Africa and find my roots because you know what? I’m fuckin broke dude. And stop being so likeable. And don’t be like ‘I understand,’ because you don’t understand.” The carefully placed victories and moments of clarity from the show are powerful and create a narrative that is effective in building tension.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the well articulated commentary on race, “Atlanta” also finds a voice in speaking on other social issues such as poverty, sexuality and masculinity. Earn always functions as the voice of reason in managing his cousin’s rap career, suggesting notably in the finale that, “stunting is kind of a trap. We should probably make a little bit more money first before we start showing it off.” Although a logical and obvious statement in the given context, scenes like these in the show really speak to much larger issues, which, in this instance, is the ongoing phenomenon that young successful rappers often have trouble managing money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in the season we see homosexuality and masculinity in the black community being addressed when two guest actors argue about how gay it is to be with a man in drag. After one man claims that men have sex with men in jail anyway and that it is still not frowned upon, he is met with the response, “Yeah but that aint gay, that’s just jail. You was on the outside … That boy gay as hell.” In the most uncomfortable and equally hilarious example of commentary, a talk show in episode seven documents a young black male that instead chooses to identify as a thirty-five-year-old white man. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What these anecdotes display is “Atlanta”’s ability to properly address social issues by sometimes depicting real everyday situations and sometimes flipping those concepts over on themselves. This, again, is reflective of the observant nature of the cast of characters. In providing these intellectuals with odd, crud and culture-bending situations, justice or not, a much larger and articulate picture is painted about what is really going on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite “Atlanta”’s countless strengths such as cast, dialogue, symbolism and cinematography, the most important — and truly the coolest — is representation. “Atlanta” is unapologetically black in a historically white industry and is reaching audiences of all backgrounds. Also, while many shows about marginalized communities use their premise as sort of a gimmick, “Atlanta” succeeds in accuracy and tells intricate stories through the black lens. To simplify, “Atlanta” does not parade blackness around for others to observe from their own view, but rather puts the audience into the black experience. One of the most exciting ways “Atlanta” does this is, of course, through the soundtrack, which features almost exclusively black artists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the show follows a rapper and his cousin manager, Atlanta appropriately has an extremely high rap representation. This newest episode alone features Tay-K’s on the run anthem “The Race.” Larger rappers like Kodak Black and Gucci Mane are also featured and proper homage is given to Atlanta icons Outkast in the finale to season one. “Atlanta” also finds proper backgrounds in genres outside of rap, by including artists such as Kamasi Washington and Curtis Mayfield on the roster too. The most memorable moment of representation is undoubtedly the Migos cameo. It comes as a celebratory moment of reflection for the city of Atlanta, as the city’s biggest musical success ever is featured and even shown selling drugs as a throwback to what funded the start of their career. These references to black culture provide satisfying nods to the people that understand them and, more importantly, expose a larger audience to the amazing things that it has to offer. Much like how a rap sample leads listeners to go back and find the sample’s origin, “Atlanta” is showcasing an exciting culture and, hopefully, leading others to explore it more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Atlanta” is nothing like any TV show the world has ever seen before. It is more real and more black than any show has ever been. It takes risks, it immerses the audience and it speaks huge volumes in brief moments. It has, in a little over a year, done wonders for black culture, shedding light on semi-hidden issues and taking what we thought we knew about race and turning it on its head. Through introspection and criticism, “Atlanta” makes us as viewers tackle real world issues head on. This amazingly complex, weird and intelligent creation from Glover shows a world of potential for the future of the artist. He may not be the one to save our divided world, but he can definitely tell us where to start.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81814\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81814\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/donald-glovers-surreal-dystopia-of-atlanta/","id":5770,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[5769,5768,5767],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Real Estate Brings Summer to February in Santa Barbara","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-02-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RE-Graphic.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RE-Graphic.jpg?resize=700%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Their performance is genuinely reflective of the band’s success, and it elevated the record’s feelings of happiness to newer heights.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Real Estate has found a brilliant niche in their vibrant, dreamy sound that provides a meditative atmosphere for ambitious explorers and daydreamers alike. The East Coast indie group has developed a unique aesthetic of elevated background music, having an outer layer of calm waves and a deeper layer of meaning and inspiration. Their live performance last Sunday at SOhO in downtown Santa Barbara displays this perfectly with fluctuating moments of passionate energy, as well as longer drawn-out spells of connected tranquility. Their performance is genuinely reflective of the band’s success, and it elevated the record’s feelings of happiness to newer heights.</p>\n<p>The longer I waited in the intimate space of SOhO, the more I realized I was in for a night away from the normal day-to-day of college life. After making my way to the bar area and ordering a gin and tonic before the show, I noticed that there was a very apparent sense of high audience diversity. Along with the high presence of Doc Martens and cuffed jeans from the college crowd, as expected, there was also a somewhat surprising amount of an older Santa Barbara crowd. Thinking back, this rings true to the band’s appeal as their pure and refined rock sound recalls older bands of music history, such as The Smiths and Pink Floyd. Moments before the tunes began, the venue filled to full capacity and anticipation filled the Sunday air. Acoustic indie songstress Bedouine kicked off the night’s festivities with soothing ballads from her 2017 self-titled release and accurately set the stage for the music to follow. After a powerful ovation from the crowd and an unfortunate goodbye from Bedouine, the stage was set for the next phase of the evening.</p>\n<p>Real Estate took to the stage and was met with high applause, and they delivered immediately with classics “Saturday” and “Had to Hear.” The music sounded as clean and vibrant as expected with a balanced mix and well-orchestrated connection. The band’s limited physical movement and crowd interaction mixed well with the feel of the sound and was balanced out by an extremely sonically pleasing presence. Although the group uses dreamy instrumentals and drawn-out essays to generate atmosphere, the life context is often successful in making these lengthy moments feel like an instant. I often found myself drifting away in Real Estate’s harmonies only to come back to reality feeling like a lifetime had just passed.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The hands-down most powerful moment of the night was early in the set when the band performed the hit song “Darling” from their latest album, <em>In Mind</em>. The synth chords moved beautifully in and out of the song’s arrangement and set a gorgeous landscape for the performance of the track. The disorienting off-beats of the instrumental hit perfectly, which was by far the most effective moment of the night in connecting with the audience; it made me move and smile like an entranced fan. Afterwards, the applause was at an all-time high for the night, and the crowd showed an amount of euphoria that I haven’t seen in a long time. It was a moment that left the crowd wondering what could possibly come next to keep the audience alive. Needless to say, the band kept the mood moving.</p>\n<p>After that glorious display of bliss, Real Estate followed with a one-two punch of “White Light” and “Crime.” Afterward came the most wild and heavy moment of the night with <em>In Time</em> standout “Two Arrows.” The track features a long psychedelic instrumental outro that makes plenty of noise in the studio version, but a mere listen to a digital copy of the song does no justice to what would happen live. The live rendition was long, distorted and crazy, with high-pitched self-made feedback screeching from the lead guitar, a punching bassline and eclectic drum fills from the sticks in the back. There were time switches and solos and guitar thrashes that left the audience in awe. When it finally faded out and all the chaos ended, there was a moment of stillness where it seemed that neither the viewers nor the band even knew what to do.</p>\n<p>A tremendous applause erupted as the bassist happily proclaimed, “It’s different every time. That was the Santa Barbara version.”</p>\n<p>After we all recovered from that display, Real Estate followed up with more vibes of “Serve the Song” and “It’s Real,” before heading out to commence the encore. After a surprisingly cohesive chant of “Real Estate!” the band came back out to appease the crowd with “Municipality” and end with show essential “Talking Backwards.”</p>\n<p>It is especially important to note the power of the band’s closer. “Talking Backwards” was a beautifully reflective moment for the set, which was the band executed flawlessly. Arguably the band’s biggest and best song, it ended the night with a sort of victory lap for the night’s main event, displaying that they are alive and well, better than ever and living it up in the beautiful and immersive atmosphere that they have created. It was outstanding, it was gorgeous, it was near perfect, and it left all of us feeling so damn happy. The night was above and beyond the level of quality and emotion that was expected, showing just what a successful, transparent and heartwarming band Real Estate is.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81667\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/real-estate-brings-summer-to-february-in-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81667\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/real-estate-brings-summer-to-february-in-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/real-estate-brings-summer-to-february-in-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/real-estate-brings-summer-to-february-in-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-28/real-estate-brings-summer-to-february-in-santa-barbara/","id":6652,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6651,6650,6649],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Netflix Anime ‘Neo Yokio’ Is Weird Yet Worthwhile","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=815%2C508&ssl=1","description":"\"Neo Yokio,\" or the Japanese form of \"New York,\" blends anime, uptown socialites and hip-hop culture into a single unique, and often overwhelming, force.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 1912, Japan gifted Manhattan with 2,500 cherry blossom trees in what is now known as Sakura Park. The beautiful flowers that bloom on the trees are a very powerful symbol in Japanese culture, and the gift was meant to establish a lasting peace and friendship between the two countries. Fast forward to 2017 and the trees have grown and evolved in the new context of a bustling New York City, and Sakura Park stands as a living, breathing example of cultural unity. Despite some fluctuation in international relations, Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig has intricately crafted his weird, quirky and creatively flawed internet-era version of Sakura Park. His new anime Netflix Original starring Jaden Smith is “Neo Yokio,” an imperfect yet extremely dynamic model of the exaggerated tropes of both New York and Japanese cultures. The work is a living culture shock, and although not worthy of high regard or reward, it is more than anything commendable for its creative liberties and merely the fact that it even exists in the first place.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Neo Yokio,” or the Japanese form of “New York,” blends anime, uptown socialites and hip-hop culture into a single unique, and often overwhelming, force. These three seemingly random movements, however, have been blending together for quite some time now. Recently, we have been seeing SoundCloud rappers with anime-ridden profiles, and the clothing brand A Bathing Ape is more prevalent than ever in the states. Rapper Lil Uzi Vert (who happens to look like an anime character himself) posts about “Cowboy Bebop” on his Instagram, and of course, the cult-classic anime-meets-black-television show, “The Boondocks,” remains a legendary piece of small screen history. But “Neo Yokio” seems to directly blend cultures more than ever before, so much so that it has become the main attraction of the show.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Neo Yokio” follows the extremely wealthy socialite and coveted bachelor Kaz Kaan, who is voiced by Jaden Smith. Kaz frequently wears high fashion brands such as Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, he is the star of his preppy field hockey team, he attends high-class parties and balls and he gets flown around town by his robot butler. His Aunt Agatha, voiced by Susan Sarandon, looks out for him and arranges appointments for his other important hobby, exorcizing demons. This leads to the first main issue with “Neo Yokio”; it has way too much going on. The work often struggles to navigate back and forth between socialite life, young city life and the wild card of demon exorcism. However, this excess does not prevent the show from maintaining excitement, commentary, occasional humor and unique style.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Outside of the saturated and scattered plot, “Neo Yokio” finds more value visually and stylistically more than anything else. The show looks beautiful on screen, and the creative character design works well in front of quality voice acting, specifically from Jaden Smith. Much like the enigmatic young prodigy, the show constantly finds redeeming moments of weird yet profound intelligence and artistry. Quotes like, “Who cares what time it is when the future is an interminable abyss of wackiness?” and “Demon be gone from this Chanel suit!” are examples of the kind of perplexing weirdness that, whether you like or not, can be appreciated.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79105\" style=\"width: 825px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1921343512\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79105\" data-attachment-id=\"79105\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/unnamed-45/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=815%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"815,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?fit=815%2C508&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-79105\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=815%2C508\" alt=\"\" width=\"815\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?w=815&amp;ssl=1 815w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=250%2C156&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed.png?resize=768%2C479&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79105\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></div>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Behind all the nonsense and randomness of this fascinating creation, there is a deeper commentary on materiality, elitism, capitalism and fandom. Throughout the colorful landscapes of Neo Yokio, Kaz is frequently seen worrying about comically insignificant things, including wearing a midnight blue suit to a black and white ball, the rundown status of his childhood home in the Hamptons and his constant belittling for being “neo-riche.” He also constantly refers to his ex-girlfriend, Cathy, who he can’t seem to get over. In this sense, Kaz functions as a modern-day animated Hamlet, coming from extreme wealth and constantly distraught and complaining about love and the world around him. This character functions well in the New York context, a clear critique of the materialistic and elitist culture that upscale cities maintain. A more direct critique of this is Neo Yokio’s list of most eligible bachelors, which appears to be a nod to “One Punch Man”’s hero rankings. In Neo Yokio, young male bachelors are ranked in a fluctuating list posted in the middle of the city. Kaz is seen going up and down on this list throughout the show, greatly influencing his perception in the public eye as well as his general happiness. This is not only a fascinating dialogue about the elite social classes in modern society, but also an interesting response to the mixed reviews that the show has been receiving. Elements like these are some of the quirks that make “Neo Yokio” a success in its details, rather than the big picture.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As far as traditional anime is concerned, “Neo Yokio” is nothing revolutionary or even memorable on a narrative level. “Neo Yokio” is more than just weird, as it also often can be choppy, strange and lacking fluidity in storytelling. This show may often bring the audience to laugh when they’re not supposed to, be taken aback by the dialogue and question what even just happened on-screen. Despite these things, “Neo Yokio” demands a watch and, more importantly, a discussion because of its unique ability to blend cultures, create profound creative moments, provoke thought and make memories. Whether or not it resonates with you or at times even succeeds to make sense, “Neo Yokio” guarantees an experience that is memorable and by all means entertaining.</p>\n<p>This is a show that, despite mixed critical reception and even accusations of appropriation, should be appreciated and enjoyed for its role in blending cultures. Even more so, we should celebrate the fact that Ezra Koenig made an anime with Jaden Smith about a demon-exorcising socialite in New York and was able to have Netflix fund it. We should celebrate the fact that we live in a time where strange art like this can be created and distributed at such a high rate. We should also celebrate the fact that, in an ever-divisive world, strange art like this has an audience. Perhaps it has less historical significance and general impact on the world than the real Sakura Park, but the ridiculous and outrageous “Neo Yokio” is still worthy of our attention and should be celebrated for its cultural push.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/netflix-anime-neo-yokio-is-weird-yet-worthwhile/","id":5788,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[5787,5786,5785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: This Old Dog by Mac Demarco","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Unknown.png?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Unknown.png?resize=225%2C225&ssl=1","description":"Mac’s attitude toward love has evolved as well.

Stop on by. I’ll make you a cup of coffee. See you later.” These were the last words the world heard from Mac DeMarco’s until May 5’s new release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and, quite frankly, it’s a good thing that they didn’t stay his last words. This softened attempt at personalization fell drastically short for two reasons. Firstly, it ended an album that was painfully similar to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with maybe half of the redeeming qualities. Secondly, it came off as a desperate scream to the skies claiming DeMarco is the coolest cigarette-soaked indie rock hero that the world has ever seen. Simply put, he was trying too hard without a worthy result. Luckily for Mac and his fans, the dazzlingly subtle new project, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solves both of these main issues. It not only showcases a new and alarmingly different acoustic style from the traditional Mac album, but it also shows our hero with a comfortable step back in his true element without the need to prove anything. After a respectable career of trying to articulate just how cool he is, DeMarco’s new evolved strength lies in his ability to simply sit back and relax. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to May 5, the traditional DeMarco album followed a very cohesive and strict formula. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another One</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> all have their token upbeat retro guitar riffs, gradual winding waves and occasional emotional high-pitched synth. After repeated listens, it becomes easy to lose track of which songs are on which albums, as all three tend to blend into one big Mac DeMarco super-compilation. For example, “Ode to Viceroy,” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and “The Way You Love Her,” from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another One</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could easily fit into sophomore project </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as there seems to be very little variation in sound from 2012 to 2015. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> however, breaks the traditional Mac mold entirely as the project is mainly acoustic with a much more withheld and meditative energy. Rather than the dreamy electronic intricate guitar riffs that flooded his discography, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is more about the gentle movement of the chords. The approach is much more minimalistic as the rich and vibrant layers of the past have been reduced to a lighter and more fragile state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most effective illustration of this separation is the first single that was released from the album, the elegantly swaying “My Old Man.” Stuck on a loop of an acoustic guitar progression and a rudimentary electronic metronome in the background, Mac’s voice of nostalgia and growing up echoes with just the right balance of movement and relaxation. This formula is mimicked more as the album advances as many songs feature a single four-bar guitar loop, a drum beat and the light purr of DeMarco’s voice. Reminiscent of the speed of Real Estate and Wilco, DeMarco’s pace is never too slow to a point of boredom and moves only as fast as a light float down a river.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/utdidBGSw5s?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;start=109&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mac has also evolved greatly in his more developed and personal songwriting. It is clear that after a few years in the industry, and simply life in general, Mac is much more mature, wise and, for lack of a better word, old. His words now come from a place of reminiscence and honesty that can only come from a more worn and weathered place. The album opens with lead single “My Old Man,” which sweetly hums about growing older and seeing the resemblance of one’s parents in one’s self. The album comes full circle in the end with “Watching Him Fade Away,” as Mac describes his incomplete closure with his dad. He croons, “and even though we barely know each other, it still hurts watching him fade away.” These two alarming realizations of adulthood are exactly what the theme throughout the album conveys. It is gradual, bittersweet and painfully beautiful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mac’s attitude toward love has evolved as well. Rather than his past approach of charming the listener into a false fantasy of love, here he has been through enough of it to have a better understanding. He sounds relaxed and satisfied with his loss on twinkling ballad “Still Beating,” when Mac expresses to a girl that “my heart still beats for you, even if you don’t feel it.” Here the longing has evolved from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> era, as not only is he finally addressing people directly and more honestly, but he has accepted the unrequited love in his maturity. Title track “This Old Dog,” feels the same way, as Mac sings out, “’Long as my heart’s beating in my chest, this old dog ain’t about to forget.” The honesty is much more apparent at this stage in his life, and we see Mac now attempting more to create an accurate message more than an impressive one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since he blew up in 2012, DeMarco has had the near perfect formula for becoming an indie rock icon. He made a song about obscure cigarettes, he wears red vans with white tube socks and he actively refuses to give a shit in most serious public contexts. His music was perfect, too. It was new and different and, above all, very very likeable. Mac has had a good spot in the industry for some time now and, quite frankly, he could have very well made another </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salad Days </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and gotten good reception, stayed right where he was. But the organic and more relatable approach to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Old Dog</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows a change that had to happen not for the industry, but for himself. Here we are given the transition process from blissfully unaware youth to nurturing and observant adult. Although not always glorified by the young and electrifying indie rock scene, Mac is in a space of growth that, maybe especially for our college context, is extremely important.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77976\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77976\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-19/the-friday-review-this-old-dog-by-mac-demarco/","id":6688,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6687,6686,6685],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Travis Scott’s Birds Eye View Soars Over SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9961-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9961-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Scott, as a performer, was up to his usual standard, as he screamed every lyric with ease and moved quickly around the stage with high energy.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The general energy for rap sensation Travis Scott has been anything but subtle recently. His last album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, was a huge success, and, more importantly, his recent tour announcement has had the hip hop world buzzing furiously. The 805 has been particularly excited with his seemingly out-of-the-way first stop of the tour at the Santa Barbara Bowl. Along with the rest of the shows on the tour, the Santa Barbara date sold out quickly — the floor seats sold out in a few minutes — and the performance put on by Scott was exactly as hyped as was anticipated.</p>\n<p>When I arrived around 7:30 p.m., the Bowl was already filled with students and hip hop fans, many sporting old Saint Pablo Tour and Travis Scott merch and an expected amount of overpriced streetwear, like Bape and Supreme. I immediately hopped in the long, winding merch line and, after about 20 minutes, I bought a few things. I later found out that, much like the Saint Pablo Tour, each city will have its own unique merchandise on sale for the audience. I then made my way to my seat to wait anxiously while some other rap hits played in the background.</p>\n<p>Travis’s DJ, Chase B, came out to amp up the crowd around 8 p.m. with some pre-concert bangers. His first selection, Young Thug’s heavy “Danny Glover,” hit the hardest and had the general admission floor moving aggressively. Among the other songs that Chase dropped were Lil Uzi Vert’s captivating ballad of “XO Tour Life” and, what is now clearly an essential at any high-energy event, Future’s earth-shattering “Mask Off.” After a good 30 minutes or so of Travis preparation, it was finally time for the dark horse of hip hop to make an appearance.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

After security quickly ran over to escort him out, Scott shooed them away and then angrily commanded them to “get the fuck off my stage.” The lucky fan then jumped into the crowd right at the drop of “Upper Echelon” in what I can imagine was the craziest personal experience of the night. This gimmick was quickly overdone, however, as too many fans after tried to get on stage and abuse the experience by overstaying their welcome, coming on at the wrong times or trying to take pictures with the performer, which was highly discouraged by Travis.</p>\n<p>Among the other hits played were the slow Travis staple, “90210,” Rodeo standout, “On My Dis Side” and lean-cup anthem “Sweet Sweet.” Every track that was played dropped hard and was met with screaming, jumping and aggressive water-bottle chucking from the man of the hour. The crowd always responded appropriately with some alarmingly large mosh pits and vibey dancing from those higher up in the seated areas. Scott, as a performer, was up to his usual standard, as he screamed every lyric with ease and moved quickly around the stage with high energy.</p>\n<p>Around the middle of the show, Travis mysteriously took what looked to be a giant stuffed plush insect from behind the DJ stand and walked it back to the mysterious giant cage that served as a backdrop for the stage. He held it up to the cage for a giant mechanical bird claw to reach out and grab, and a huge mechanical bird similar to the one on his website was soon revealed behind the cage flapping its wings.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77147\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77147\" data-attachment-id=\"77147\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/img_9937/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_9937\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77147\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_9937.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-77147\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The heaviest and most popular bangers were saved for last, as “3500,” “beibs in the trap,” mega-hit “Antidote” and Kendrick-featured “Goosebumps” were among his final performances. He also included his wildly popular collaboration with Young Thug and Quavo, “Pick Up the Phone,” which involved him running up into the middle of the seated crowd. However, the peak of his show was right before these last songs, when the giant bird emerged from behind the cage and came to center stage, flapping its wings and lighting its eyes up. Travis then climbed on top of the winged beast and led the crowd in what were easily the two rowdiest songs of the night.</p>\n<p>As far as the performance goes, no one in attendance could complain. Travis put on a crazy show, and the crowd was ready for the ride. Although the set was a little bit too short for the respective buildup, the show was still as incredible and ridiculous as I hoped. This tour will likely go down as one of the recent greats of the hip hop world, along with Kanye’s Saint Pablo and Drake’s Summer Sixteen.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77134\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77134\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/travis-scotts-birds-eye-view-soars-over-sb-bowl/","id":6702,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6701,6700,6699],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"RL Grime Soundtracks A Sunny Deltopia Weekend","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/04.09.2017.FranciscoBarrera.WarmUp20.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/04.09.2017.FranciscoBarrera.WarmUp20.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last Saturday’s hosting of heavy trap DJ RL Grime was a clear attempt to keep kids off the streets of I.V. during Deltopia; the students responded with immense praise.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB students should study hard, carry themselves well and, for the love of God, please lose the party reputation.

Last Saturday’s hosting of heavy trap DJ RL Grime was a clear attempt to keep kids off the streets of I.V. during Deltopia; the students responded with immense praise. As the high energy, sold-out crowd and consequently empty Isla Vista can attest, the plan was a huge success.</p>\n<p>Born with the less exciting name of Henry Steinway, RL Grime is an electronic music producer based out of Los Angeles. He blew up online in the early 2010s with his debut EP, Grapes, and his later hit remix of “Mercy” by Kanye West. Since then, he has risen to electronic superstardom amongst the likes of Flume and Major Lazer with his 2014 Void EP and, more specifically, his bass-heavy hits “Core” and “Tell Me.” He more recently was on the world-famous Coachella bill in 2016 as well as the electronic festival, Snowglobe, in Tahoe.</p>\n<p>RL Grime has recently joined the likes of legendary artists such as Snoop Dogg, Diplo and Anderson .Paak to perform at UCSB. It is also worth mentioning that opening act Destructo was also a solid addition to the show and brought a more narrow EDM-favoring crowd in early for some pre-Grime womps.<br>\nSecond-year Ryan Andrews explained, “EDM is a huge part of the culture here. We all love rap and rock as well, but it is really nice to get to come to see some legit festival quality DJs for such a cheap price.”<br>\nBut even for someone outside of the electronic culture, RL Grime provided a high-energy set that was difficult to dismiss for lovers of any genre.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>RL Grime, along with his elaborate assortment of heavy electronic drops, is an extremely talented mixer that wields a unique ability to incorporate other genres into his set. The skill that tends to unite communities is his constant integration of popular hip-hop into his electronic beats, which was made most prevalent with his smash hit remix of “Love Sosa” by Chief Keef. The general approach is to take the already infectious hook of a popular hip-hop song, throw it over a heavier and steady beat and use it as a segue to another electronic drop or melody. Grime has mastered this technique. The genres, which normally seem like polar opposites, were mixed seamlessly in his performance which kept the set flowing well and constantly captivating.</p>\n<p>Among the other songs sampled were throwback “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” by Kanye West, The Weeknd’s broken love ballad of “The Hills” and the new instant classic from Future, the beautiful “Mask Off.” These tunes kept the set dancy and vibrant as well, which can help with the common complaint of an electronic set being too monotonous or artificial. Destructo used the same technique but to a less frequent degree, most memorably with the addition of XXXTentacion’s controversial “Look at Me” amidst his pounding electronic bass.</p>\n<p>As a prominent artist in the UCSB community, RL Grime’s beats caused the audience to respond with vibes that were, for lack of a better term, electrifying, all night long. The student crowd had the same energy as any other typical RL Grime show: plenty of sweaty bodies jumping, moshing, screaming and borderline violently losing their minds to all of the gnarly beats that were dropped. Regarding the performance, Leah Bronstein responded simply yet elegantly: “It was grimey,” she stated, “grimey with a side of filth.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76894\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1628105958\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76893\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76894\" data-attachment-id=\"76894\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/rl-grime-by-franciscobarrera-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,682\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"RL Grime by FranciscoBarrera 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76894\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RL-Grime-by-FranciscoBarrera-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Francisco Barrera / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As a music enthusiast and writer, I often feel that it is my given duty to dislike everything that the Electronic Dance Music phenomenon stands for. I’m inclined to believe that it is artificial, without any real message or intelligence and painfully repetitious. The idea of a concert where jumping is the only acceptable form of dancing and drugs are encouraged for enjoyment seems ridiculous to me, and I often find it easy to slouch back into my corner of artistic snobbery with all of the other non-believers. However, there is a lot to be admired here; RL Grime is amazing. The internet EDM hero brought together a ton of different kids with merely a laptop and creativity. He truly is an extremely talented mixer.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, I had way too much fun at this concert. The lights were dazzling, I was moving around like an idiot, I was hooked. The bass hit hard, people were going nuts and it was exactly what you would expect. Mesmerizing seems to be the only word to describe my experience as I was constantly finding myself lost in the sheer euphoria that was presented to me.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76893\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76893\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/rl-grime-soundtracks-a-sunny-deltopia-weekend/","id":6699,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6698,6697,6696],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Travis Scott to Light Up SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Previews: What's Going On","publish_date":"2017-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/travisscott_pubshot5-2-_wide-8fd868038cba59049f7345c7b3ffe947045ce37d.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/travisscott_pubshot5-2-_wide-8fd868038cba59049f7345c7b3ffe947045ce37d.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At a Travis Scott show, the rapper and his dedicated audience are wild in every sense of the word.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Houston hip-hop mastermind Travis Scott has always been what can only be described as an animal in the rap game. He is young and energetic, he acts on impulse and he has an alarmingly fierce dedication to his craft. His first two albums were rodeo-themed, as Scott was understanding and learning to control his inner beast, while his recent effort, <i>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, </i>depicts him hunched over with large bird wings, displaying the full incarnation of his inner animal.</p>\n<p>The best illustration of Travis as an animal, however, is the notorious reputation of his live presence. At a Travis Scott show, the rapper and his dedicated audience are wild in every sense of the word. Travis jumps around and screams into the mic like a man possessed, water bottles and shirts fly everywhere and mosh pits open up and rage with energy only a wild animal can posses. This all being said, it was more than appropriate when the internet and rap community went into a crazed frenzy on March 8 when Travis Scott announced phase one of his Birds Eye View tour, which includes a stop at the famous Santa Barbara Bowl.</p>\n<p>This tour announcement, which also includes stops in Europe and across the U.S., has been in the making since last August when the southern madman released his long-awaited second studio album, <i>Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight</i>. This album was well worth the wait, as its long collection of bangers gave him a No. 1 debut on Billboard as well as positive reception from all major music blogs. Among its consistent strong energy are hits “Goosebumps<i>,</i>” featuring Compton prophet Kendrick Lamar, and mega hit “Pick Up the Phone,” featuring wild card Young Thug and Migos icon Quavo.Despite this very strong recent effort from Travis, it is in no way the beginning of his musical success. His dark production and surreal, heavily autotuned sound have been rising since his mixtape <i>Days Before Rodeo </i>and his next-year debut studio album <i>Rodeo</i>. While <i>Days Before Rodeo</i> featured high octane collaborations with Young Thug and Migos, <i>Rodeo</i> launched Scott into serious mainstream success, specifically on the coattails of monumental banger “Antidote.” After he was recognized as a young powerhouse in rap, it was not long before listeners discovered the rest of his full, strong discography and slowly magnified the young rapper into the icon he is now.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Infamous general admission seats at this show in particular sold out in less than an hour, and many stops on the tour have already sold out completely. Travis is looking to make this a huge year for his live shows, as these coming shows are merely “phase one” of the bigger Birds Eye View tour. He is also listed on many festival lineups, including the world-famous Coachella bill. This is his first string of shows since the rowdy Rodeo tour with Young Thug in 2015, and this time around he is bringing along rising star Khalid and frequent collaborators Virgil Abloh and Chase B.</p>\n<p>As this tour will surely attest, Travis Scott is an animal in the unpredictable and chaotic rap game. His shows are hectic, belligerent and without any sign of civilization. After a career of building to this level of monumental success, this explosion at the Santa Barbara Bowl will be a victory lap as well as a commanding power forward. The evil genius has already announced another studio album for 2017 entitled <i>Astroworld</i> as well as a collaborative album with Quavo, so this is only the beginning of 2017 for Scott. Now is an extremely exciting time for Scott and the community as they get to celebrate the genius of a young artist and the monumental energy of his booming success.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-03/travis-scott-to-light-up-sb-bowl/","id":6540,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6539,6538,6537],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: Drunk by Thundercat","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-03-at-2.57.32-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-03-at-2.57.32-PM.png?resize=980%2C630&ssl=1","description":"On Thundercat’s whimsical cacophonic trek through the land of Drunk, he has had a little too much liquid courage and finally lets out the thoughts that a sober self pushes to the back confines of th...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Thundercat’s recent full-length studio album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may seem like the first that a large-scale audience will truly hear of him, a quick look at music’s recent trends will prove otherwise. Electro-jazz bass talent Stephen Bruner, better known as Thundercat, and his collective label Brainfeeder, has been a powerful influence on the modern hip-hop and R&amp;B scene for quite some time now. Bruner and his mastermind collaborator, Flying Lotus, were major producers for Kendrick Lamar’s earth-shattering masterpiece </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Pimp a Butterfly,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Thundercat himself has added his colorful production to many important artists, such as Mac Miller, Childish Gambino and even the iconic Miss Erykah Badu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, there has been a gradual push in hip-hop and R&amp;B toward a more melodic, jazz-influenced sound and Thundercat has been a steady force. One listen to this vibrant and beautifully disorienting odyssey that is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and this push becomes overwhelmingly apparent. This record, however, is monumental for Bruner, as he is finally stepping out from behind the curtain and taking center stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I stated before, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an odyssey if music has ever heard one. It begins appropriately with opening track “Rabbot Ho,” and then continues to descend into a conceptual drunk madness. The album begins as most wild nights do, upbeat and light, then progresses as the substance seeps in, bringing out darker thoughts and emotions only to end with tracks “3AM,” “Drunk,” “The Turn Down” and “DUI.”</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flying Lotus is an extremely present voice on this project, as the track list shows him featuring on eight of the23 songs. Although the whole album rings with his abstract and lucid approach, the project does not lack individuality. There is a clear and distinct Thundercat sound throughout. His production is solid and diverse, whether it be his vintage bass walk on cult hit “Them Changes,” the surreal electronic drive of “Friend Zone” or the smooth instrumental groove of “Jethro.” This impressive musical effort keeps listeners engaged throughout and provides a fresh and new sound to the music community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The colorful production that moves this album is also equally matched by a very clean and strong vocal performance from Bruner. His voice is a smooth glowing entity that is wonderfully unique to his work. The melodies he creates are a perfect match for his production: distinct, different and jazzy. The work showcases a few features as well such as Pharrell Williams, jazz icon Kenny Loggins and the legendary rap prodigy Kendrick Lamar. These artists specifically are no strangers to this wave of music that Thundercat has engineered and add their own influence effortlessly on their respective tracks. The one sore thumb on the ballot, however, comes at the hands of weed-glorifying master of mediocrity, Wiz Khalifa. As Khalifa is not exactly what you would call an acclaimed music artist, he seems a bit out of place on the track “Drink Dat.” Despite this apparent setback, it hardly halts the strong track and it is thoroughly surrounded by excellence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another X factor on</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the unique comedic twist that Bruner has incorporated into his lyrics. Whether it’s his painfully honest claim to “beat your meat, go to sleep,” his “Dragon Ball Z” references or his literal meowing over the track “A Fan’s Mail,” the weird quirky sneak peak into Thundercat’s life makes for honest lyricism and a comedic talent similar to that of singer-songwriter Father John Misty. Once again, we can observe great cohesiveness as his odd twist in his words accents his unique production eloquently</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite these quirks that make the album true to Bruner, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is at the end of the day a thematic existential crisis that shows an artist struggling, asking questions and answering them simultaneously. Thundercat’s lyrics continually show him contemplating death, the fleeting construct of time, madness, love, police brutality and everything in between. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s title track near the album’s close shows our hero on the negative side of the substance-use spectrum, pleading that “I’m drowning away all of the pain till I’m totally numb, sometimes you want to feel alive, but not on someone else’s time.” Painfully honest statements like these along with little nuggets such as “It’s okay to disconnect sometimes,” makes this album a profound and moving work to go through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an age old saying, especially prominent in the college setting, that goes along the lines of this: “Drunk statements are just sober thoughts.” On Thundercat’s whimsical cacophonic trek through the land of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he has had a little too much liquid courage and finally lets out the thoughts that a sober self pushes to the back confines of the mind. This album is intelligently and elegantly drunk, and at it’s best moments, even wasted, in every sense of the word. It is eccentric, cringeworthy, silly, sad and, most of all, honest. Drunk hits home with its ability to be all of these extreme things and still remain alarmingly relatable to all who listen. Although surely we are not all similar to the mastermind that is Stephen Bruner, we now know that we are struggling with similar staggering, crippling, sloppy drunk issues. It is these issues and Thundercat’s complex dance with them that makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of the most compelling musical quests of the year thus far.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76167\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76167\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-03/the-friday-review-drunk-by-thundercat/","id":6807,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6806,6805,6804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Friday Review: CULTURE by Migos","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.49.22-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-03-at-12.49.22-PM.png?resize=942%2C336&ssl=1","description":"The brilliant X factor in this group’s success is the Migos’ conscious realization of their influence in spaces that transcend music. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Atlanta’s Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, who make up the trio known as Migos, have always made music that is more than just <i>music</i>. They breathe the voice of hip hop’s most vibrant city, they craft anthems for a young and energetic generation and they drop some of the filthiest bangers on the face of this planet. Simply put, it’s more than music. It’s culture.</p>\n<p>Many Migos mixtapes and albums have come and gone, but the hip hop community, internet and culture were especially buzzing for this one. The group had been lurking in the background after the overdone and frankly overrated “Pipe It Up,”and with the dab trend having died out, many dismissed the group as superficial gimmick rappers. But everything changed in October with the single “Bad and Boujee.”</p>\n<p>“Bad and Boujee,” as Donald Glover pointed out in his Golden Globes name-check of the track, is extremely important — for Migos, hip hop and all of us. “Bad and Boujee” showed the world not only that Migos are back stronger than ever, but also that they are making much more than gimmick hits. This song is the thesis statement, manifesto and earth-shattering proclamation of <i>CULTURE</i>, the album and the construct. The infectious bounce of this hit is why the hype is so present around this album, and upon the first listen, this hype is absolutely warranted.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The album opens up with the title track, “Culture.” Featuring DJ Khaled, this song utilizes the most appropriate hypeman possible because, whether you like him or not, Khaled has established himself as a cultural icon over the last year. The next few tracks keep the album’s opening extremely high energy, as heavy-hitting singles “T-Shirt,” “Call Casting” and “Bad and Boujee” follow.</p>\n<p>The rest of the album, which features entirely new material, is extremely consistent with strong production, smooth southern flow and a few well-placed features. Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and Travis Scott, who all mesh perfectly with Migos, have standout roles. “Kelly Price,” featuring Travis Scott, particularly shows the group’s versatility as they weave in and out of a downtempo beat with melodic verses. This album’s strength lies in the ability to go in on a harder beat and contrarily sing well on a slower one. Other highlights include the head nodder “Get Right Witcha,” and a Zaytoven-produced piano banger called “Big On Big.” The contrasts between each track are noticeable and keep the listener engaged throughout the album. The only noticeable flaw is the drawn-out length of some of the songs.</p>\n<p><i>CULTURE</i> is extremely important for the careers of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, as it is the most seriously they have been taken and is the first true album from the group that will be listened to as such. After early breakout hits like the Drake-remixed “Versace” and club favorite “Hannah Montana,” Migos were all about internet presence. They made hot singles that were played for fun at parties, often memed on the internet, and nothing more. However, after signing onto Kanye’s G.O.O.D. Music label and this release of a cohesive and consistent album on the coattails of “Bad and Boujee,” Migos are finally serious hip hop contenders.</p>\n<p>The brilliant X factor in this group’s success is the Migos’ conscious realization of their influence in spaces that transcend music. Upon listening to this album, it is extremely apparent that their approach has changed from a hit-making formula to something both enigmatic and fluid. Quavo, Offset and Takeoff have used Atlanta to create music that is not for profit appeal but for the appeal of themselves, their roots, their experience and their audience. Migos have started a dialogue with their audience that we must engage in — for ourselves, for the music, for each other, for the culture.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-03/the-friday-review-culture-by-migos/","id":6707,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6706,6705,6704],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Shwayze Buzzes at Surfrider Show","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Shwayze-Photo-Courtesy-of-Rae-Ann-Varona-PRINT-1-e1464280204267.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Shwayze-Photo-Courtesy-of-Rae-Ann-Varona-PRINT-1-e1464280204267.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"IV Surfrider's Concert for the Coast featured booths with info about beach care, raffle prizes and, of course, a free concert with Shwayze as the headliner.

Saturday’s musical festivities were of a similar nature, until rapper Shwayze took the stage and livened up the place.</p>\n<p>This past Saturday, the Isla Vista chapter of the Surfrider Foundatio held their annual Concert for the Coast. The event featured booths with information about beach care and raffle prizes with proceeds going to Gaviota Coast preservation, and, of course, a free concert with Shwayze as the headliner. Audience size fluctuated throughout, but relaxing Gauchos filled Anisq’Oyo for the whole day, and the event functioned as a nice escape from the upcoming stress of finals.</p>\n<p>Before Shwayze’s grand entrance, some alternative reggae bands warmed up the crowd. Cali Conscious, Rebel Shakedown, Layovr and West Swell, which consisted of some UCSB alumni and current students, were among the opening acts. These local talents created a sense of community among the park with their original anthems of Santa Barbara life. Their free-spirited beach vibes mixed perfectly with the shining sun and had the audience in high spirits. There were some familiar tunes in the air as well, as Layovr provided a nice Bob Marley medley and a cover of MGMT’s “Electric Feel,” and West Swell covered “Valerie” by Amy Winehouse and performed a mashup of Drake hits.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The typical widespread seated crowd of the park was quickly moved up to their feet around the stage as soon as Shwayze was set to make his appearance. His DJ came out first and offered the crowd their first chance to get “Shwaysted” with some EDM before the man of the hour officially performed. Although his opening track, a Bob Marley EDM remix, came off as slightly tasteless, the following hard-hitting drops effectively conditioned the crowd for the fun night to come.</p>\n<p>Shwayze finally hit the stage at around 6 p.m. and the crowd reacted with appropriate energy (to say the least). He was accompanied on stage by the aforementioned DJ, as well as his hype-man/five-year-old son, Hendrix. Hendrix mainly just played around the stage as his dad performed, and occasionally was picked up to help mouth some of the lyrics. Although Shwayze made it a point to take hits from the various joints burning in the crowd as well as to continually remind them to “light up,” he often comically covered his mouth and watched his language when his son was listening.</p>\n<p>The young rapper’s set list consisted of tracks spanning throughout his career, including songs from his self-titled debut album as well as his most recent work “King of the Summer.” One of the most energy-inducing performances of the night included his 2014 hit, “Love is Overrated,” which the audience continually screamed along to. The throwback feel was clearly alive and well as Shwayze jumped around the intimate stage.</p>\n<p>The whole crowd was alive with familiar reminiscence as the summer partier performed the first hits of his career, “Buzzin” and “Corona and Lime.” The park knew a surprisingly large amount of the lyrics as the rhymes rung out into the air. Needless to say, because these two songs are essentially the staples of Shwayze’s career, they provided the most rewarding moments of the night. Although jumping and dancing saturated the entirety of the set, the most enjoyment came from his two biggest throwbacks.</p>\n<p>In complete transparency, it doesn’t take a music analyst to know that Shwayze doesn’t exactly compare to the other acts that have come to UCSB this year, especially when the show took place a week after the extremely anticipated Extravaganza. However, this event was a raging success for multiple reasons. Firstly, Shwayze can actually put on a hell of a show with a remarkable amount of personality and likeability. Secondly, it was a very heart-warming gathering of hundreds of Gauchos in the name of summer relaxation and quality music. Lastly and certainly not least, the community came together for a good cause — the preservation and protection of local beaches — and raised some good money. Love him or hate him, Shwayze’s here to have a good time, and the crowd was always down to join in.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71470\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/shwayze-buzzes-at-surfrider-show/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71470\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/shwayze-buzzes-at-surfrider-show/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/shwayze-buzzes-at-surfrider-show/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/shwayze-buzzes-at-surfrider-show/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-26/shwayze-buzzes-at-surfrider-show/","id":6744,"author":{"id":690,"name":"Max Pasion-Gonzales"},"related":[6743,6742,6741],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/690"}},"__N_SSG":true}
