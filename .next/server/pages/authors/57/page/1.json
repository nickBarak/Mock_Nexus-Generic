Powell brought in eight points in the first half as well as six rebounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the Mustang roster, senior guard Ridge Shipley and sophomore guard Donovan Fields led Cal Poly, going eight and six respectively in the first period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shooting started off with a jump shot from Powell and a quick three-pointer in response from Fields. Both teams traded baskets consistently until the 12th minute when only four points were scored, one from Mustang junior guard Victor Joseph and the other from Gaucho junior forward J.D. Slajchert, until 7:40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The score was kept relatively close until the sixth minute when UCSB made a small charge to take the lead 23-18, thanks to a surge of energy from freshman guard Max Heidegger along with Powell. After a three-pointer from Shipley at 3:54, no further points were scored in the first period, putting the score at 27-23 Gauchos at the half. </span></p>\n<p>At no point did the Mustangs ever catch up to the Gauchos; the closest they came to closing the lead was right at the beginning of the second period with a jump shot one minute in from junior forward Luke Meikle, bringing the score to 27-25.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos managed to score 30 in the second half, 12 of which came exclusively from Childress. Overall, Childress led the board with 19 points, the next closest scorers only bringing in 10 each. He had a great game with three steals and two assists.</span></p>\n<p>Junior forward Alex Hart only put four on the board tonight, a few less than he has been lately, but managed to snatch up 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos managed to run away with the score, starting with a jump shot from freshman guard Christian Terrell. From 16:49 to 11:47, UCSB brought in 14 points while Cal Poly had seven missed shots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last five minutes of the game were characterized by a three-pointer and jump shot by Heidegger and four foul shots from Childress as well as a three-pointer from Victor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB came away with a 39.0 field goal percentage, well above Cal Poly’s 30.5. Santa Barbara had 45 rebounds and profited 13 points off of turnovers while the Mustangs had 36 rebounds and made six points off of turnovers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 16 points from the Gaucho bench, 10 of which belonged to Heidegger, who continues to improve and play with fire and speed. In the last few games, the younger members of the team have truly grown, hopefully leading to a successful 2017-2018 season for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p>In the end, UCSB will only be losing one senior in Childress, but the guard will be a tough replacement to find, not just on the court, but off it.</p>\n<p>Childress ends his career with the third-most assist in UCSB history (407), and the second-most steals (153).</p>\n<p>The senior has been a consistent force for the Gauchos over the past four years, and he will always be known as one of the better players to represent the UCSB basketball program.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/thenexus_sports/status/838260790360588288</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-06/gauchos-disappointing-campaign-ends-with-highlight-win-at-cal-poly-send-childress-off-with-one-final-victory/","id":514,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[513,512,511],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos End Senior Night On Happy Note After Win Over UCR","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-03-01-at-1.44.09-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-03-01-at-1.44.09-PM.png?resize=873%2C585&ssl=1","description":"With point guard Eric Childress as the only senior on the team, it was evident that Gauchos played with their hearts on their sleeves as they reigned victorious in their final home game.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>As this was UCSB’s home season finale, the home fans were excited and came in numbers, with 1,618 in attendance that night. After a brief ceremony celebrating UCSB’s sole senior, the game got off to a quick start with Highlander junior forward Alex Larsson scoring in the first 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>At 6’10”, Larsson barely had to jump to get the ball in the basket. Although both teams racked up points quickly, raising the score to 20-11 UCSB by 12:30, the Gauchos did a great job of keeping a tight defense. By preventing UCR from driving, UCSB defense was able to keep their score down, but was having trouble guarding the outside three pointers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This night was a celebration of Childress, and whether it was the team’s energy or the fact that it was going to be his last game at the Thunderdome, he was on a roll. Scoring a total of 21 points, he went 4-4 on his first four three pointers and ended up 5-8 overall on threes.</p>\n<p>“You have to work as hard as you can because time flies by and it’s not going to wait for you,” Childress said.</p>\n<p>With Childress on fire and Gaucho defense looking strong, the only slight improvement possible was getting more shots off. The UCSB team was on the same page, had great ball movement and knew where everyone was on the court.</p>\n<p>One effective Highlander tactic utilized throughout the entire game was a hard press. With the Gaucho point guard and one or two other players covered and searching for an open pass, UCR efficiently ran down the UCSB shot clock, giving the Gaucho offense only around 15 seconds to shoot rather than the usual 30.</p>\n<p>UCR senior forward Secean Johnson did not have as great of a half as spectators might have expected. Only putting two points on the board, he was all over the court and takings sloppy shots during the first half, but found his stride in the second period.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played the first half guns blazing, leading by up to 12 multiple times. For the majority of the half UCSB was able to hold onto a 10-point lead.</p>\n<p>Gaucho sophomore forward Jarriesse Blackmon had a great game, both defensively and offensively, even scoring on two separate occasions exactly as the shot clock ran out, sending the crowd into a frenzy both times.</p>\n<p>With two minutes left in the first period, UCR stepped up and managed to bring the score within one point, Gauchos leading 32-31.</p>\n<p>At the half, Gaucho shooting was at a season high with a 54.5 field goal percentage. 15 of 31 Highlander points were from their bench while on the UCSB side of the court, 15 points alone were from star senior Childress, who had made 5-6 three pointers.</p>\n<p>Although he came away with three personal fouls, freshman guard Christian Terrell was an essential asset to the Gaucho victory, not only scoring but also defending.</p>\n<p>“Terrell’s defense made a real difference for us,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In the first half, we did not play anywhere near as well when he was off the floor.”</p>\n<p>Rebounds were bountiful for the Gauchos this game, all players doing a great job of not only getting a first hand on the ball but keeping possession and working as a team to move it up the court. Junior forward Alex Hart was all hands, grabbing an impressive 15 boards this game.</p>\n<p>Offensively, freshman guards Max Heidegger and Clifton Powell made big runs. Both had the ability to work from either side of the court and shoot from outside. Powell specifically had a great night, especially after a foul that resulted in Highlander points. He turned up the energy and even made a glorious shot from a couple feet outside of the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“In practice, I’ve been working on catching and shooting,” Powell said. “My primary game is getting the ball to the basket.”</p>\n<p>Despite Highlander efforts to catch up to the Gauchos, UCSB was able to keep their lead until the very end. Winning 68-61, the game ended in style with a flying dunk from Terrell.</p>\n<p>The best part of the night was the last minute of the game. Starting with a few fans in the student section and quickly spreading to the entire events center, an “Eric Childress” chant began and continued until the end of the game, with all Gaucho supports on their feet.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great Gaucho performance and a fantastic senior night for Childress. The Gauchos will next face Cal State Fullerton on the road on Thursday, March 2 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76030\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76030\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/gauchos-end-senior-night-on-happy-note-after-win-over-ucr/","id":493,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[492,491,490],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Men’s Basketball Looking to Hold On to Slim Postseason Chance Entering Final Home Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_2-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_2-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently at the bottom of the Big West standings, the UCSB men's basketball team is on its last leg of hope to grab the eighth seed in the Big West tournament.

Not only has he scored the brunt of the Gaucho baskets since Vincent has been out, but he has played with a noticeable energy and fierceness to the last minute of the game.</p>\n<p>In his most recent game against Long Beach State, he only put seven on the board, but before that he scored 16 points in the victory against Hawaii last Thursday and has been an essential asset to the team, starting the last five games averaging 12.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>Despite only scoring four points, Gaucho freshman guard Christian Terrell had a solid game against LBSU as he tied his career-high grabbing nine rebounds. Although Terrell has had some hesitation in the past when it comes to taking the shot, he has started in six conference games so far and continues to improve.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Highlanders’ field goal percentage is 42.1 while the Gauchos are barely hanging onto their 37.1, a league-worst mark. An unfortunate recurring theme for the UCSB team is their inability to shoot with accuracy. The trouble is not getting to the basket but getting the ball in the basket.</p>\n<p>Aside from Hart and team leader senior guard Eric Childress, freshman guard Max Heidegger is an explosive player that drives hard and puts points on the board, yet with so many top players unable to participate, the Gauchos are suffering as clearly demonstrated in their record.</p>\n<p>One area that Santa Barbara does excel in, at least ever so slightly better than UCR, is rebounding. The Gauchos are averaging 36.6 per game compared to the Highlanders’ 34.8, showcasing how they are getting in there and grabbing the ball off both offensive and defensive glass.</p>\n<p>UCR has a fantastic free throw percentage of nearly 73 percent on the season compared to the Gaucho percentage of 64 percent. In their most recent game, UCSB had 17 personal fouls called on them; against a team as accurate as Riverside, the Gauchos will have to play smart and not commit as many fouls, especially on the offensive end.</p>\n<p>For Childress, Thursday will obviously be an emotional night as it will be his final game wearing a Gaucho uniform in the Thunderdome. The senior will look to cap off his home career in the right way improving upon his team-high 8.5 points per game, 3.5 assists per game and 2.2 steals per game, also a Big West best.</p>\n<p>The co-captain of the team alongside Vincent, Childress has played on some great Gaucho teams, and although this wasn’t the ending he expected, a win could mitigate some of the damage done to his senior season.</p>\n<p>As the season winds to a close, all teams are trying to bring in as many wins as possible heading into the Big West tournament. As this will be each team’s second to last game, expect both teams to bring all they have got to the court.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gaucho and UCR Highlander game will take place this Thursday, Feb. 23, in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 23rd, 2017’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75874\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75874\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/75874/","id":248,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[247,246,245],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB To Begin 3-Game Home Stand, Host Hawaii Tonight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-04-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Currently on an eight-game losing streak, the UCSB men's basketball team is hoping that a return to the Thunderdome will lead it to overcoming its winning drought.

With Vincent still out due to a torn ACL, all other Gaucho shooters will need to be at their best.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warrior to watch out for in this game will absolutely be senior Noah Allen. In the last Hawaii-Santa Barbara matchup, the California native managed to put 34 points on the board in 34 minutes of playing time. Allen currently ranks fifth in the Big West in PPG averaging 15 a game.</p>\n<p>Before becoming a star player at Hawaii, the senior guard played three seasons as a UCLA Bruin and was part of two NCAA Sweet Sixteen teams. Since transferring, Allen has scored 359 points this year and has a field goal percentage of 46.7 percent.</p>\n<p>Other strong starters include junior forward Gibson Johnson and sophomore forward Jack Purchase who average 10.9 and 10.1 points per game respectively. With Johnson, Purchase and Allen all towering at 6’7” and above, it will be essential for the Gauchos to get back and closely protect the basket.</p>\n<p>Despite losing their most recent match-up, the Rainbow Wahine have still put forth a solid campaign thus far. Defeating UCSB would create a nice cushion for the ’Bows as they and the Long Beach State 49ers both hold 6-5 conference records. A Santa Barbara upset would be greatly applauded although it is unlikely considering the Gauchos shooting woes.</p>\n<p>All season, UCSB has had extreme trouble with shooting accuracy. They are able to get to the basket and get clean shots off, but they are not being completed, leaving the team with a 35.9 field goal percentage in conference play, a league worst.</p>\n<p>Four out of the Gauchos’ last six opponents have scored at least 78 points, so the fact that Santa Barbara is only averaging 57.3 points per game is problematic and is going to be a real setback, especially when facing Hawaii.</p>\n<p>UCSB is currently in a rut, having lost eight in a row and only breaking the 60-point mark once in the last seven games. It will be good to have the boys playing at home again as all three of their wins have happened at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>Along with Heidegger, junior forward Alex Hart and senior guard Eric Childress have been holding down the fort for the Gauchos. Since recuperating from the flu bug, which he caught on the trip to Hawaii, Hart has been playing his best ball, averaging 13 points in his last three games while also scoring a career-high 16 points against UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>Childress, the team’s only senior, has also been great despite not having that special senior finish he was expecting. In his last outing at CSUN, the point guard went off for 16 points and, with a chance to end his senior year on a high note, expects to continue producing at a high level.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos have an opportunity to get a win at home, and as there are fewer and fewer games left in the 2016-2017 season, a home victory is exactly what the team needs. Head to the Thunderdome tonight at 7 p.m. to cheer on the Gauchos as they take on the University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75747\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75747\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-to-begin-3-game-home-stand-host-hawaii-tonight/","id":472,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[471,470,469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos’ Losing Woes Continue After Loss to CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-13-at-2.11.17-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-13-at-2.11.17-PM.png?resize=980%2C602&ssl=1","description":"Still winless on the road, now 0-11, the UCSB men's basketball team has loss eight consecutive games after enduring another blowout defeat to Cal State Northridge.

UCSB finally found its stride toward the end of the first half, and although they were not quite able to shut down CSUN’s lead, the Gauchos were able to greatly reduce it.</p>\n<p>Dawson led the Matadors during the first half in both points at 10 with a field goal percentage of 80 percent and eight rebounds. Childress was keeping the Gauchos afloat, scoring 13 in the first half, adding to UCSB’s three-point field goal percentage of 57.1.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho starters were working hard to make plays happen along with freshman guard Max Heidegger, who has proven to be the source of many Gaucho points this season. In the last 1:05 of the half, both teams pushed to score as much as possible, with UCSB gaining four points and CSUN gaining three, making it a close game of 34-31 at the end of the first period.</p>\n<p>Although during the first half it may have seemed as though the Gauchos might be able to come back, nothing about the second half sent that same message. UCSB starter junior forward Alex Hart scored twice in the first two minutes for the half, but a jumpshot from Matador freshman center Mahamadou Kaba-Camara sent the Gauchos into a four-minute dry spell.</p>\n<p>Even though UCSB was still trailing, the team managed to keep the lead small until the sixth minute when Northridge had crept up to a 10-point lead. Between senior guards Kendall Smith, Darin Johnson, Aaron Parks and junior guard Michael Warren, the Gauchos did not stand a chance.</p>\n<p>With Heidegger and Childress carrying the bulk of the Gaucho points, it is no surprise that UCSB lost when four out of CSUN’s five starters scored a minimum 12 points each.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ loose ends were unfortunately on display during the second half, especially in comparison to the Matadors’ clean and high level of play. In just the second half, UCSB had only one steal from Childress and caused seven turnovers, giving the Matadors unnecessary opportunities to score. CSUN, on the other hand, only caused three turnovers and managed to snag five steals. Little details such as these do in fact make a difference, as UCSB saw this weekend.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were making baskets all of the way until the end of the game; they were just unable to make them at the same speed as the Matadors. All season, UCSB has had the same huge problem: shooting and scoring. The team is able to get tons of shots off, but the shots are just not making it into the basket. Although effort does count for a lot, in this game, accuracy counts more.</p>\n<p>Now sitting at the very bottom of the conference, the UCSB Gauchos have five games left until the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>Desperately hoping to end their eight-game losing streak, the Gauchos will take on the University of Hawaii at the Thunderdome on Thursday, Feb. 16 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75666\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75666\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/gauchos-losing-woes-continue-after-loss-to-csun/","id":470,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[469,468,467],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lose Seventh Straight Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_6-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MensBasketballChristinaDeMarzo_2-2-17_6-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Losing 47-64, the Gauchos took a blow to the ego as well as its now 3-19 overall record.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another disappointing loss at UC Irvine pushes the UCSB men’s basketball team losing streak to seven.

This half the Gauchos needed to figure out how to start getting points on the board, and Hart absolutely made that happen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After only scoring two free-throws in the first half, Hart had a perfect game, making every shot he took in the second half and adding 14 to the Gauchos’ score. In 13 minutes of playing time during the second half, he made the biggest impact for UCSB by far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Hart was able to score a career-high of 16 total points, one player was no match for the Anteaters. The Gauchos only allowed four more points to be score in the first 15 minutes of the second period, but they were not scoring any at all.</span></p>\n<p>By the middle of the second half, Irvine had established a solid nine-point lead that the Gauchos were having serious trouble breaking. It was not until the 11th minute that Santa Barbara clearly had no steam left. UCSB trapped with 27 on the board for three full minutes, the Anteaters were able to take the opportunity to grab another eight points.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that point on, Heidegger and Hart carried the team as best they could, but could not keep up with Dimakopoulos, sophomore forward Johnathan Galloway and freshman guard Eyassu Worku. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaucho junior forward J.D. Slajchert scored the last basket of the game with 48 seconds left, putting the final score at 64-47 Anteaters. </span></p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ended the game with a 34.5 field goal percentage while Irving finished at 41.7 percent. Although their shooting has not improved, UCSB did manage to profit 12 points off of turnovers, a skill the Gauchos struggle with.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine was absolutely a tough opponent, but UCSB has the chance to turns things around as the team travels to take on Cal State Northridge on Saturday, Feb. 11.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75646\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-lose-seventh-straight-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75646\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-lose-seventh-straight-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-lose-seventh-straight-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-lose-seventh-straight-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/gauchos-lose-seventh-straight-game/","id":467,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[466,465,464],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Loses Big at Home Versus CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MBball-DustinHarris-160305-IMG_0099-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite hanging in tough in the first half, the Gauchos were eventually blown off their home court by the Matadores losing 78-57 and falling to 1-5 in the Big West.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team just could not quite hold off the CSUN Matadors on Wednesday, losing at home 78-57.

\r\n</script> \n<p>At the 10-minute mark, halfway through the first half, the score was low, Gauchos leading 15-13. No. 8 UCSB was putting up a formidable fight against No. 4 CSUN. The two teams crawled up the board basket by basket as both forced turnovers and tried to profit from them.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman center Tyler Jackson entered the game at 9:56 in his second-ever court appearance. Within 50 seconds he made a sweet steal, an offensive rebound, and 2-2 foul shots. With UCSB’s usual big players still out, Jackson has had large shoes to fill on the court.</p>\n<p>At 8:38 CSUN redshirt junior guard Darin Johnson made a steal and had a fast break down the court, but he was no match for UCSB senior guard Eric Childress, who took the ball right out of Johnson’s hands, turned around and made a layup, sending Gaucho fans to their feet.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, one of CSUN’s most valued players — redshirt junior guard Kendall Smith — was not making as many moves as expected. Averaging 16.5 points per game in the regular season, he only scored one basket the entire first half.</p>\n<p>On the other half of the court, team leader junior guard Gabe Vincent was on fire, going 4-6 in three-pointers. Dominating the court on defense as well as offense, he managed to put 16 on the board before the half ended and was able to tap into energy the Gauchos so desperately needed.</p>\n<p>This was a historic night for Vincent as well as UCSB basketball. With 4:11 left in the first half, Vincent made his 183rd career three-pointer, passing Gaucho legend Orlando Johnson and becoming number nine on the UCSB all-time top 10 list of three-pointers made. He went on to finish the game with a total of 185 completed threes.</p>\n<p>As the half went on the Gauchos seemed as though they knew what they wanted to do, but just could not get the shot off. Lots of time was spent handing off around the three-point line with few drives, but UCSB held its ground.</p>\n<p>After such an evenly matched half, the last two minutes were startling as the Matadors found their stride. Scoring seven points in one minute, the Matadors flipped a switch and were able to run all over the Gauchos without resistance.</p>\n<p>Aside from two more three-pointers made by Vincent, the Matadors increased their score by 13 points in just over three minutes, leaving a shocking halftime score of 36-32.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the first half, CSUN came out of the gates guns blazing as the second period started. For every shot a Gaucho took, the Matadors took two. All players were playing with heart, but the Matadors were simply moving faster and shooting more accurately.</p>\n<p>With Childress and Vincent missing shot after shot, it was clear the Gauchos had lost their groove and were struggling to pick their heads up. After Vincent’s brilliant first-half performance, going 0-7 in field goals made for a disappointing second half.</p>\n<p>UCSB freshman guard Max Heidegger was a firecracker with impressive ball handling, hard drives and risky but successful shots. He especially shone in the second half when Childress and Vincent seemed burned out.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just have to be better”, stated Vincent, “I’m not sure what we shot tonight but I’m sure we didn’t shoot it well”.</span></p>\n<p>Starting around the 13th minute with a three-pointer from junior guard Michael Warren, the Matadors were able to keep a steady 10-or-more-point lead for the rest of the game. Based on of the level of competition in this first half, this surge from CSUN surprised and devastated Gaucho fans.</p>\n<p>As the second half dragged on and players on both sides of the court continued to get more and more frustrated, the roughness of play also increased. Although CSUN players were on the floor multiple times in the first half, many Gauchos joined them in the second half. They finished the game with 17 Matador fouls and 20 Gaucho fouls.</p>\n<p>To top it all off, both Lubin and Smith dunked in the last five minutes of the game, only furthering the frustration of the home team. Lately the Gauchos have not been able to keep up the energy and precision of play as games wind to an end, a flaw that was unfortunately on display in this most recent game.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just have to be better”, stated Vincent, “I’m not sure what we shot tonight but I’m sure we didn’t shoot it well”.</span></p>\n<p>Although it was another conference loss piling onto the disappointment of losing at home, the first half of the UCSB-CSUN game gave Gaucho fans hope.

But judging by the current conference standings, CSUN’s team is going to be a tougher challenge.</p>\n<p>Since the start of Big West play, senior guard Kendall Smith is the conference’s leading scorer, averaging 19 points per game. Overall, he ranks second with a 16.5 PPG average.</p>\n<p>Following closely behind his fellow starter in PPG average is junior forward Tavrion Dawson at 14.1 per contest. The 6’8” power player scored 14 points on UCSB last year and is currently the top rebounder on the team, averaging 5.8 boards per game and grabbed a career-high of 14 boards against the University of Bethesda this season.</p>\n<p>A well-rounded player from the CSUN bench to watch for is redshirt sophomore forward Rakim Lubin. He averages 5.5 rebounds per game, just behind Dawson’s 5.8 average, and has a field goal percentage of .533. In each of his last two games he has fouled out after getting the maximum five fouls, but he has still managed to score 13 of the 29 bench points against the number one team in the Big West, UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>The Matadors will not be an easy matchup for the Gauchos, especially since the CSUN field goal and three point field goal percentages are both respectively over nine percent better than those of UCSB. Finishing plays to completion has been one problem for the Gauchos this year that has yet to be fully resolved.</p>\n<p>Although junior forward Jalen Canty and sophomore forward Ami Lakoju remain unable to play, it seems that the Gauchos have found a solid starting line-up.</p>\n<p>In their most recent game, junior guard Gabe Vincent was able to score 18 points alongside junior forward Alex Hart’s 10; unfortunately, the Gauchos’ shooting ability was no match for UC Riverside’s starting lineup. With four out of five starters scoring in double figures, UCSB could not keep up.</p>\n<p>Alongside Vincent and Hart, senior guard Eric Childress, sophomore forward Maxwell Kupchak and freshman guard Clifton Powell have started off the last four games and have been able to effectively keep opposing teams’ scores low.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore center Tyler Jackson has made his first appearance in a UCSB game this past weekend. Jackson redshirted his first year and has been unable to play this season due to an injury, but he definitely made waves in his 11 minutes of playing time on Saturday. Standing at 7’2”, his height is necessary under the basket since two Gaucho bigs are not currently able to play.</p>\n<p>Although it may seem late in the season, the Gauchos are slowly finding their rhythm. In their most recent game every player — starting and from the bench — put points on the board except for one. A younger team with a new playing style is no easy feat for Head Coach Bob Williams, and the team’s skills will be put to the test again as they face the Matadors.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara hosts Cal State Northridge in a conference match at 7 p.m. tonight, Jan. 25, at the Thunderdome.

The two teams traded buckets until 9:39 when 49er freshman guard Loren Jackson made the three-pointer that started the Long Beach lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the half went on, the scoring slowed down as both teams struggled to find a solid squad on the court, moving many players on and off the bench. The last 1:12 of the first half solidified Long Beach’s lead as they increased their score by six points, four of which being completed foul shots by junior forward Roschon Prince. UCSB junior guard Tide Osifeso managed to land a three-pointer with two seconds left, finishing off the first half being 37-47.</span></p>\n<p>The 49ers had kept a small but steady lead during the latter part of the half but where they managed to outplay the Gauchos was in the details of the game. Although the two were tied in team rebounds, the Long Beach players managed to use more assists, make more blocks, and collectively have three less turnovers than UCSB, resulting in their 10-point lead.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ending the first half, the top three scorers in the game all belonged to LBSU. Yussuf lead the board with 12 points, followed closely by junior guard Evan Payne with 10, and sophomore guard Noah Blackwell with eight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going into the second half, the Gauchos certainly had their work cut out for them. UCSB came into the period looking strong, scoring six points in under a minute at 16:52, but the 49ers were not about to let the score get too close, working back up to a nine-point lead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the 15th minute to 11:45 left in the game, only two baskets were made: a free throw from UCSB junior forward Alex Hart and a three-pointer from Osifeso. This period of time was otherwise characterized by numerous missed shots on both sides of the court as well as a couple fouls from either team as the players began to fatigue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scoring became significantly less frequent in the last 10 minutes of the game. While Yussuf and a handful of other 49ers traded off scoring, senior guard Eric Childress single-handedly powered through for the Gauchos. Childress scored 11 points, nine of which were uninterrupted by any of his teammates, as the clock ran down. </span></p>\n<p>At 3:45 the Gauchos caught up to the 49ers off a layup from Childress, putting the score at 70-70. Unfortunately, UCSB did not have quite enough steam to take a lead despite the valiant efforts of Hart, who grabbed four boards and made two jump-shots in the last few moments.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it was not reflected in the final score, the Gauchos managed to outscore the 49ers in the second half 39 points to 34. Both teams worked hard and by the end of the game had totaled a similar number of rebounds, assists, and turnovers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Losing only by five points, it was a close and well-fought match-up, but the 49ers consistently made more baskets making 46.4 percent of their shots while the Gauchos were only successful on 39.3 percent of theirs taken. </span></p>\n<p>Although LBSU would have been a definite step forward, the Gauchos have a chance to redeem themselves Saturday night when they play UC Riverside who is 4-11 overall despite their two-game winning streak.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75088\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75088\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-lose-a-close-one-at-lbsu/","id":304,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[303,302,301],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looking to Pick Up Second Big West Win at LBSU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After finally halting their three-game losing streak, the Gauchos will look to keep the ball rolling when they head to Long Beach to face the struggling 49ers.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74872\" style=\"width: 532px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74872\" data-attachment-id=\"74872\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/ucsb-looking-to-pick-up-second-big-west-win-at-lbsu/christian-terrell-dribbles-around-a-defender-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MBball_atUCLA-161214-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Christian Terrell dribbles around a defender.

Overall, Long Beach has been solid on offense, averaging 73.8 points per game, which is the third-best mark in the conference, while also holding down the best free-throw percentage as a team with a 73.5 mark. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its four conference games this season, Long Beach State has scored an average of 81.5 points per game, a Big West high. However, its defense has been its Achilles heel; it has allowed the most points per game (87.2) while also giving up an astonishingly high three-point percentage at (41.2), both conference worsts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior guard Justin Bibbins currently leads the 49ers in minutes played, averaging 31.6 per game, as well as in assists with 82 so far in the season. Last year he earned second team all-Big West honors as he played in all 33 games as the Long Beach main point guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Bibbins’ fellow starters, junior guard Evan Payne, has averaged 14.7 points per game in the season and now 15.5 per game in conference. With junior forwards Gabe Levin and Roschon Prince grabbing 99 and 109 rebounds respectively, the starting lineup for Long Beach will present a challenge for the Gauchos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their last game against Cal Poly, junior forward Alex Hart stepped up to lead the Gauchos to victory, scoring 15 points and grabbing 11 boards in his 36 minutes of playing time. With junior forwards Jalen Canty and Ami Lakoju unable to play, it is up to Hart and sophomore forward Maxwell Kupchak to rise to the challenge of being UCSB’s “bigs” under the basket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman guard Clifton Powell Jr. has been electric on the court. Having started two out of the Gauchos’ three conference games so far, he has a conference field goal percentage of 45.1, proving to be a real asset when the pressure is on. This came to fruition again in Saturday’s win as Powell knocked down two big three balls — the only threes by the Gauchos that night — proving to be the difference in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from up and coming younger players, junior guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Eric Childress are still holding down the fort as reliable and seasoned veterans despite their combined score of 12 points in their most recent game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the 49ers and the Gauchos have experienced a rough season so far, but as the conference has only begun, both teams are eager to gain better footing through another win tomorrow night. With talented players to watch on both sides of the court, the Long Beach-UCSB match up will not be one to miss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB and LBSU tip-off is at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 19 in the Walter Pyramid Arena. The game will also be televised on Fox Sports West.</span><br>\nA version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 19, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

These two guards make plays and take shots, pushing along the speed of play.</p>\n<p>Childress played hard all 34 minutes that he was on the court, coming away with four defensive rebounds as well as four assists. Despite Santa Barbara accounting for 18 total turnovers in their opener, Childress was a bright spot only turning the ball over twice.</p>\n<p>An up-and-coming power player for the Gauchos is redshirt sophomore forward Ami Lakoju. Having only made it into 15 games last season, he scored 12 points in his 16 minutes of playing time on Saturday. In addition to an offensive rebound, he managed to grab five defensive boards as well.</p>\n<p>Lakoju first gave the UCSB fans a glimpse of his abilities in an exhibition game against Fresno Pacific where he made three baskets in under one minute. His speed and power this year has been balanced nicely by counterpart junior transfer forward Jalen Canty, who shot 2-4 with five points against the Mavericks.</p>\n<p>His speed and power this year has been balanced nicely by counterpart junior transfer forward Jalen Canty, who shot 2-4 with five points against the Mavericks. In their exhibiton, Canty went off for 17 points, a performance the Gauchos hope they can get in this match-up.</p>\n<p>Canty, a distinguished player from the City College of San Francisco, has maintained his position as a starter and managed to rebound four balls, block two and grab five points in his 22 minutes against the Mavs. His size and energy on the court have already made a difference for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Despite losing key players Devin Watson and Tim Derksen — two Dons that played really well against UCSB — USF is coming in hot after having closely won their first game against Illinois-Chicago 82-80.</p>\n<p>One returning player, sophomore guard Mladen Djordjevic, scored eight against the Gauchos last year. Having worked his way to a starting position this season, the former Serbian U-20 Men’s National Team player scored nine against the Flames along with four assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>Two returning starters, forwards Nate Renfro and Chase Foster, stand to step up into bigger leadership roles this year. Last season they only scored a combined three points against the Gauchos. Now that their top dogs are gone, it is their chance to show the team just what kind of players they are.</p>\n<p>As a freshman last year, Renfro shot 51.2 percent and had 19 blocks on the year, proving his capability as a starter. Against Illinois-Chicago, he scored 12 points over 27 minutes along with three assists.</p>\n<p>Foster came away with eight points, shooting 4-9 against the Flames. During the 2015-16 season, the Colorado native made 27 three-pointers and played in all 30 games.</p>\n<p>Senior Ronnie Boyce shone brightly as a leader against the Illinois-Chicago, scoring 28 points in 26 minutes of playing time, 13 points more than any other player on the court. Boyce, a guard originally from Oklahoma, will definitely be a player to watch.</p>\n<p>Transferring to USF as a junior in 2015, he earned his position as third-leading scorer on the team, including a career-high 25 point performance away with a career high of 25 points, a personal record he has already beat in just the first game of the 2016-17 season.</p>\n<p>In last year’s UCSB-USF game, Boyce played only two minutes. Judging by his performance last week, the Gauchos will most likely be seeing plenty of him.</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams faced-off, UCSB may have won, but the Dons fought it to the end, scoring six points in the last minute of the game.</p>\n<p>Having just lost at home, the Gauchos will be looking to turn around that 0-1 record at the Thunderdome on Wednesday, Nov. 16 at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

I thought he was good, especially second half, very aggressive, trying to score, he rebounded well both halves,” Head Coach Bob Williams said.</p>\n<p>The California native led all scorers with 17 points and ran all over the court grabbing seven boards and registering two blocks.</p>\n<p>The home team started a bit slow but managed to take an 8-5 lead into the first official timeout. After a made three-pointer by FPU’s junior point guard Jordan Belasco that tied the game, the Gauchos scored seven unanswered and saw most of its starting five head to the bench.</p>\n<p>After two made baskets by the Sunbirds, sophomore forward Ami Lakoju scored six points in a row over the course of 52 seconds to extend the UCSB lead to nine at 21-12.</p>\n<p>Last year, Lakoju scored a career-high four points at Cal, a statistic he crushed today scoring six baskets for a total of 12 points while snagging four boards.</p>\n<p>By the end of the first half, the Gauchos took an impressive 36-22 lead. Three of Santa Barbara’s newest additions, Canty, and freshman guards Christian Terrell and Clifton Powell Jr. combined for 11 points.</p>\n<p>Without any single player emerging as a beast for Fresno Pacific in the first half, the Sunbirds worked together to earn their 22 points with three-pointers scored by senior point guard T.J. Viney, Belasco and junior guard Sam Holmes.</p>\n<p>As the second half began, it was clear that the home team was starting to pull away. The Gauchos started the second half strong with back-to-back layups from Canty.</p>\n<p>Later in the final frame, UCSB successfully made three long balls in a row, one from junior guard Gabe Vincent and two from senior point guard Eric Childress, to take a 51-29 lead.</p>\n<p>After that, at the 8:29 mark, freshman guard Terrell made a fantastic steal, quickly passing down the court to a wide-open Childress.</p>\n<p>The senior caught the pass mid-stride, scoring effortlessly, raising Gaucho supporters to their feet as the home team took a game high 26-point lead at 69-43.</p>\n<p>Having only scored over 80 points on five occasions last season, the Gauchos finished the game with a whopping 82 while holding their opponents to 62. Fifty of those points were earned by four players — Canty, Childress, Vincent, and Lakoju — with each scoring in the double-digits.</p>\n<p>Despite the overall loss, Kavika Jimenez led FPU with 13 points, six rebounds, and three assists.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara saw many good things from its young team, but primarily from the big three that will be leading the team this year: Childress, Vincent, and Canty.</p>\n<p>Childress played great finishing with 10 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. Vincent, on the other hand, was only 3-10 from the field but all three shots made were from long distance, plus two free throws from the line saw him scoring 11 points on the evening.</p>\n<p>“I was pleased with the leadership from Eric [Childress] and Gabe [Vincent],” Williams said. “They played well but more importantly were so poised and had good leadership with the young kids as they got rattled.”</p>\n<p>There are a number of seasoned players on this team, but the Gauchos gained new talent this year and though they appeared to be comfortable and fluid on the court, there is room for improvement as the season progresses.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s basketball season will officially start with a non-conference game against Nebraska-Omaha on Saturday, Nov. 12 at 2:00 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Cubs, having not won since 1908, and the Indians since 1948, gave both teams the intense motivation to push them to game seven. Each game, inning, and play has kept baseball fans across the nation glued to their televisions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading by three at the top of the eighth inning, the Cubs had reason to feel confident, but leave it to the Indians to come back from behind when pressure is on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This has been the first World Series to be tied in the ninth inning since 1991 between the Twins and the Braves, according to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These two knock-out teams managed to keep it tied and send the game into extra innings, stirring up every Cubs and Tribe fan alike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here it was, the 10th inning that will go down in Cubs baseball history. Indians pitcher Bryan Shaw  intentionally walks Anthony Rizzo, a hitting all-star this post-season, as well as Addison Russell,  to prevent any chance of hits from these two. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist slammed double into left field, sending Albert Amora Jr. home to push the Cubs ahead. Miguel Montero, then singles, knocked Rizzo home for another run. The Cubs headed into the bottom of the 10th with just three outs standing between them and their first World Series title in over a century. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crowd has seen this scenario before in the eighth inning when the Indians were able to turn it around; the real question was would they be able to pull it off again in the 10th?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carl Edwards Jr., Cubs reliever, managed to snag two outs. But with one left, the Indians scored as right-handed hitter Rajai Davis smacked a line drive to center field. Mike Montgomery enters as the Cubs attempt to clench one last out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within two pitches, the Chicago Cubs had made history. It took every member of the team, both offensively and defensively, to achieve what this group has achieved, and the victory is oh so sweet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Zobrist, Cubs second baseman, and seasoned player, was named Series MVP after his hit in the 10th-inning of game seven that changed baseball history. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zobrist was most recently a Kansas City Royal and helped in winning the 2015 World Series. His presence on the field as a defender has made quite the impression, causing </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usatoday.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to call him a “super utility player,” as well as his stellar record as a switch-hitter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mlb.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cubs coaches and administrators alike have called Zobrist a professional and role model both on and off the field — both from his “work ethic” to “clubhouse professionalism.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A close runner-up would have been Rizzo as he played an enormous role in leading his team to victory, but the second baseman’s title was well earned. Ben Zobrist is a name no Cubs fan will ever forget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This National League powerhouse team was chosen early in the 2016 season as a team to watch and has now surpassed all expectations and crushed all doubts.

Besides having also won five pennants, this team took it all the way to the top in 2015 only to lose the World Series to the reigning American League champions, the Kansas City Royals. It seems evident that this New York team is fired up and ready to claim the title as their own this year.</p>\n<p>According to<a href=\"http://mlb.com\"> <em>mlb.com</em></a><em>, </em>Madison Bumgarner is likely to pitch for the Giants against the Mets’ Noah Syndergaard. Affectionately known as “Madbum” and “Thor,” these two power players have both played solid seasons with their teams going 15-9 and 14-9 while on the mound, respectively.</p>\n<p>Bumgarner, a 27-year-old from North Carolina, made his MLB debut in 2009 and has impressed the baseball world ever since. Although he was part of three World Series champion teams and has won numerous individual accolades, 2014 remains his best year to date.</p>\n<p>He was the winner of the Babe Ruth Award, named NLCS MVP, as well as World Series MVP in addition to his exceptional performance in postseason. Out of high school, he was selected tenth overall by the San Francisco Giants and has only continued to improve his abilities as a player and a teammate.</p>\n<p>Syndergaard, only having made his debut in May of 2015, has been a firecracker on the field and an enormous asset to his team. Drafted 38th overall by the Toronto Blue Jays, this Texan quickly worked his way to the top leaving a notable trail behind him.</p>\n<p>In 2013, he started for Team USA in the Futures Game and by the end of the year was ranked the 11th-best prospect in baseball by<a href=\"http://mlb.com\"> <em>mlb.com</em></a><em>.</em> He performed with outstanding ability in the 2015 World Series as a rookie and became the second- youngest Met to win a World Series game. Although he is newer to the big leagues, Syndergaard has certainly proven his worth, not to mention his knack for strikeouts.</p>\n<p>The winner of this game will advance to the divisional round of the National League playoffs on Friday where they will meet the top seeded Chicago Cubs. During the 2016 season, both Wild Card candidates have been evenly matched with the National League Central team.</p>\n<p>In May, the Giants defeated the Cubs two games to one, yet in September San Francisco lost at home in a four-game series, losing the set 3-1.</p>\n<p>Alternately, in early July the Mets swept the Cubs when playing on their own turf, but lost the three game set at Wrigley Field, 2-1.</p>\n<p>This year’s potential World Series candidates are at their strongest and working their hardest. While a majority of the 2016 Major League Baseball Season has been exciting, nothing compares to the intensity of postseason play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-05/nlds-showdown-set-giants-and-mets-set-to-square-off/","id":3330,"author":{"id":57,"name":"Quinn Moslander"},"related":[3329,3328,3327],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/57"}},"__N_SSG":true}
