According to witness reports, the 19-year-old male said he was going for a quick dip in the Pacific. However, his friends’ reported they were confident he did not know how to swim and forgot his floaties at home.</p>\n<p>After arriving on the 6500 block of Del Playa, officers attempted to prevent the subject from going down to the beach and escort him back to a securely landlocked patrol car. However, the aquatics enthusiast resisted officers’ attempts to shepherd him away from the sea, proclaiming his desire to “look at the offshore oil rigs”.</p>\n<p>Officers reported the subject’s decibel level rarely dropped below shouting volume. Despite the risk of ruptured eardrums, IVFP learned from the would-be-merman he had consumed “about 4 beers” after suffering estrangement from his significant other.</p>\n<p>IVFP eventually managed to get the subject into a patrol car. The wannabe Phelps was booked for public intoxication.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43696\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43696\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-19/police-blotter-76/","id":3808,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3807,3806,3805],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Educational Program Draws Mixed Reactions","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Ahmed Mousa grew up hearing about Palestine every day.

For many students, this was one of the most educational parts of the day.</p>\n<p>Rojon Atapour, a fifth-year political science major and current co-president of OTI, said the diversity of perspectives in the group made for enlightening discussions.</p>\n<p>“Even though as a group we all sat down with the very same speakers, it is amazing the interpretation people got of what was being said or the message that a certain speaker was giving, in even understanding overall what they were trying to convey to us,” Atapour said. “It is amazing how you could just be sitting with the same people and completely get a different interpretation of what was being said.”</p>\n<p>Atapour said the environments and communities in which students were raised had direct effects on their perceptions of the trip’s experiences.</p>\n<p>“The best way to put it is because of our backgrounds, be it our major or our religious beliefs or our family or our community or whatever it is, these are like certain lenses we see things through, so when the speakers are talking to us we will see things through lenses we are familiar with seeing,” Atapour said. “But by going through Reflections we get to see it through other peoples’ lenses and gain a much bigger understanding of how different people interpret and analyze information.”</p>\n<p>The open narrative promoted by the Olive Tree Initiative has drawn criticism from some viewpoints advocating strongly for one side or the other. Ha-Emet — a student, faculty and community organization concerned with the effects of OTI on the Jewish community — has taken issue with several aspects of the program, including their meetings and association with individuals who have expressed anti-Israeli views.</p>\n<p>Co-President Timna Medovoy, a second-year global and international studies major, said the gulf between extreme views can make OTI an easy target for either side.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that this is a very, very polarized conflict,” Medovoy. “We kind of try to be this neutral position and we try hard to be bipartisan and to be non-biased on all these things, but when two sides are so polarized it is very easy for either side to claim that we have bias. A lot of people who are on either side do not necessarily want the sides talking.”</p>\n<p>Graduate advisor Mike Schwartz, a second-year graduate student in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, agreed with Medovoy and said extreme viewpoints could be uncomfortable with any organization that listens to the other side.</p>\n<p>“Everyone wants to tell their stories if it is the truth,” Schwartz said. “When you tell a story where it is less clear where the blame falls … both sides will be uncomfortable with you saying anything other than ‘my version is right.’”</p>\n<p>However, Medovoy — a citizen of both Israel and the U.S. — said local reactions to the program were overwhelmingly positive, albeit surprised. Medovoy said several shopkeepers were particularly shocked to see the easygoing relationships between students from disparate backgrounds.</p>\n<p>“Every time we walked into a store, the store owners were like ‘Wait, what are you doing together?’” Medovoy said. “Because I would speak Hebrew and she would speak Arabic … every time people would hear us speaking two different languages and walking together they would say, ‘What are you doing together, how do you know each other?’”</p>\n<p>In a region defined by conflict for over 60 years, religious and cultural differences can become ingrained into the identities of the groups involved. According to Atapour, the Olive Tree Initiative brings students connected to or interested in the conflict to the center of the issues at hand, providing a unique perspective and forum for all points of view.</p>\n<p>“I think we have a virtue as California students being detached from the region and our political disposition does not necessarily correlate with a religious or ethnic identity; oftentimes it does influence it, but the conflict is not a daily thing for us,” Atapour said. “For me it’s just normal to have many Jewish and Muslim friends growing up in LA … We live in California — it is a very diverse community. This is what is normal. In the Middle East or in other parts of the world — but especially in Israel and Palestine, as a whole — communities usually stick with each other. To have this level of diversity is not common, especially where these communities more often than not are at odds with one another.”</p>\n<p>Atapour said this gap between cultures, often given tangible form by physical barricades separating groups, is a major obstacle for peace.</p>\n<p>According to Atapour, “[The problem] is the lack of positive exposure and the lack of inter-faith, inter-ethnic groups studying together at school or living among each other and yielding a positive thing as opposed to a conflicting environment.”</p>\n<p><em>This is the third and final installment of the feature titled The Olive Tree Initiative.

The emerald escapist then fled on foot up Del Playa Drive, promptly colliding with a stop sign on the corner of Camino Pescadero.</p>\n<p>However, the Green Lantern never gives up without a fight and, in a superhuman feat of agility, remained upright and continued his flight with several deputies in pursuit.</p>\n<p>Perhaps in the hope that his green face paint and hair coloring would serve as better camouflage off the street, the fleet-footed suspect sought refuge in a nearby residence on DP. As the cops followed him into the house, he made a ninja turtle-worthy leap over the back fence into another nearby residence.</p>\n<p>Following the indignant cries of the Del Playa residents — none of whom wished to press trespassing charges — officers eventually apprehended the mischievous leprechaun inside a third DP residence.</p>\n<p>Upon his arrest, the captured fugitive articulated that he wanted to provide deputies with a formal statement. However, after the suspect was transferred to the I.V.

Strauss Foundation, a program that funds public service projects, in hopes of starting such an organization on campus. After learning about the OTI’s similar goals through a student leader summit on the issue, Ofer and fellow Gaucho Saleh Abdulla — at the time the co-president of the Muslim Student Association — helped bring OTI to the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>“When we presented our initial idea around the university, our kind of thing was: an ex-Israeli Defense Force soldier and a Yemeni Muslim … and co-president of the Muslim Student Association are trying to work together to bring this incredible experience to other UCSB students and to the UCSB community,” Ofer said.</p>\n<p>According to Ofer, OTI stepped in to provide a “middle ground” between some of the viewpoints on campus.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t want the conflict to be perpetuated on our campus,” Ofer said. “There’s enough conflict going around and as students, we are going to be making the policy in the future … It is really important that we are educated on these issues so we can make positive influences when we are in those positions.”</p>\n<p>Over the summer of 2010, Ofer and fellow UCSB student Omer Harari traveled with OTI to the Middle East. Last summer, Co-Presidents Atapour and Medovoy, together with Mousa and graduate advisor Mike Schwartz, doubled the previous number of UCSB delegates to the Olive Tree Initiative and are currently active in the growing organization on campus.</p>\n<p><em>This is the second of three installments of the feature titled The Olive Tree Initiative.

One year later, Wehrenfennig and 15 fellow UCI students and two faculty members left the West Coast for the Middle East on OTI’s inaugural trip.</p>\n<p>Upon his return from OTI’s maiden voyage, Wehrenfennig said the program’s feedback made it obvious that the Initiative had found a niche in the UC system.</p>\n<p>“It very soon became clear that there is really a huge need to continue that kind of educational response to the questions that we have to deal with on campus when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Wehrenfennig said.</p>\n<p>The program has since expanded to six UC campuses, but only Irvine, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Santa Cruz have sent students abroad. Two new chapters at Berkeley and San Diego are gearing up to send their first delegates this upcoming summer.</p>\n<p>During the most recent expedition, the student diplomats spoke with royalty and servicemen, including a former Israel Defense Forces soldier on one day and the prince of Jordan on another — and often met with up to six or seven individuals each day, covering a wide range of opinions on the conflict.</p>\n<p>Atapour, a fourth-year political science major and co-president of OTI, said that unlike many other campus groups that discuss contemporary Middle Eastern issues, the organization goes to great lengths to remain unbiased toward any single point of view or political opinion.</p>\n<p>“Overall, the most important thing is to have this outlet on campus that people [can] go to that emphasizes education and not political advocacy,” Atapour said.</p>\n<p><em>This is the first of three installments of the Olive Tree Initiative feature.

Summoning his inner wild side, the juiced juvenile used the bottle as his personal machete and took a determined swing at one officer. While Pineapple Skyy may be good at knocking out freshmen just graduating from wine coolers, it was significantly less effective on trained law enforcement officials; the suspect was quickly disarmed and muzzled up with a personal pair of handcuffs.</p>\n<p>Despite his constraints, the fermented-fruit-sipping fiend was not yet ready to throw in the towel. When officers discovered a glass bottle of marijuana in the boy’s pocket, he took advantage of the distraction and, having already lost the fight, went with the other instinct and scrambled down Sabado Tarde Road with his hands still cuffed. Though cuffs can often make people quicker in the bedroom, the same cannot be said for the cantering criminal, who was quickly chased down and tackled … again.</p>\n<p>The suspect ended his tropical tonic-fueled adventures along with several other primal pals in the Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42565\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42565\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-03/police-blotter-74/","id":3817,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3816,3815,3814],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Extravaganza Restricted To Campus, Kept Private Event","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Program Board will keep the Extravaganza music festival local this year by banning all non-UCSB attendees.

While ASPB plans to release this year’s lineup in about two weeks, hip hop artist Cee Lo Green announced earlier this month on his website he would be performing at the festival.</p>\n<p>Special Events Coordinator Ali Abbas, a third-year political science major, said the theme of this year’s concert is “your fees, your festival.”</p>\n<p>“The fact that we are not allowing out-of-towners will mean a better experience for the students,” Abbas said. “They are really our priority.”</p>\n<p>ASPB Commissioner Rae Yamamoto, a fourth-year black studies and art history major, said this year’s changes directly address student complaints.</p>\n<p>“After last year’s Extravaganza, Program Board received many complaints about the lines, the crowd and overall safety of the event,” Yamamoto said in an e-mail. “To remedy the students’ issues, we changed our policies.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College second-year Anne Gumina said the event’s exclusivity spares her from suffering through a potentially disappointing lineup.</p>\n<p>“I chose not to see [Cee Lo Green] at Coachella and I would choose not to see him at Extravaganza,” Gumina said. “Cee Lo Green … more like go ‘Cee’ Al Green, ‘cause he’s better, and you really can’t make sincere love to ‘Fuck You.’”</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_36991\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">[media-credit name=”Daily Nexus File Photo” align=”alignleft” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1512718368\" data-slb-group=\"36989\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-36991\" data-attachment-id=\"36991\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/extravaganza-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=1808%2C971&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1808,971\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\"}' data-image-title=\"extravaganza\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?fit=888%2C476&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-36991\" title=\"extravaganza\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza-250x134.jpg?resize=250%2C134\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"134\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?resize=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?resize=1024%2C549&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/extravaganza.jpg?w=1808&amp;ssl=1 1808w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]<p id=\"caption-attachment-36991\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Previous Extravaganza artists include Ludacris, Rebelution, Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeros and Girl Talk. A.S. Program Board’s decision to only admit UCSB students is a response to last year’s complaints of long lines and overcrowding.</p></div>The festival will be held at its traditional venue, Harder Stadium. Yamamoto said ASPB hopes this year’s modifications will make the day more enjoyable for UCSB students.\n<p>“Many students complained about the lines, having to wait hours just to get into the festival,” Yamamoto said. “By limiting the festival to UCSB only, we hope to create a more efficient system of entry.”</p>\n<p>In addition, Yamamoto said last year’s crowds caused several safety hazards for attendees and put dangerous stress on the area’s emergency services.</p>\n<p>“Last year, there were no ambulances available in the county for two hours because they were all at Extravaganza to aid the concert-goers,” Yamamoto said. “Most who were in need of paramedic assistance were out-of-towners.”</p>\n<p>Despite the exclusivity of this year’s festival, Abbas said he encourages the public to attend ASPB’s many other open performances.</p>\n<p>“We’re sorry that community members can’t participate in this event, but we have many other concerts and events that are open to the public,” Abbas said.</p>\n<p>ASPB helped coordinate the upcoming Chilla Vista festival, a showcase of local music and art which will be held in Ansiq’ Oyo’ Park on May 1 at noon.</p>\n<p>Yamamoto said the future of Extravaganza is yet to be determined pending students’ reaction to this year’s festival.</p>\n<p>“I think any changes made will be determined after we see how this year goes,” Yamamoto said.</p>\n<p>Students, faculty and staff members will be required to present an ACCESS card to enter the festival.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36989\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36989\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-25/extravaganza-restricted-campus-private-event/","id":3135,"author":{"id":209,"name":"Jack Crosbie"},"related":[3134,3133,3132],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/209"}},"__N_SSG":true}
