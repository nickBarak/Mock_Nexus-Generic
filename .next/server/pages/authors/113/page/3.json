Rather than admiring the images, however, students were staring at the ground.</p>\n<p>“Trump build the wall 2016,” “Obama is a Muslim” and “Muhammad fucked children” were among the slogans etched in chalk throughout campus, concentrated around the North Hall mural and South Hall, which holds the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. On the sidewalk in front of the Asian Resource Center was the phrase, “Currency is devalued.”</p>\n<p>UCSB maintenance staff washed much of the chalk away by Thursday afternoon, leaving only blurred marks and puddles, but many students remained troubled by the aggressive messages.</p>\n<p>“Given the climate, given what [Donald] Trump’s name has come to mean — that it’s connected to white supremacist groups with racism — I think that was intentionally targeting [minority students],” said Zachary King, a sociology graduate student.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69230\" style=\"width:

third-year economics major and a member of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), said the messages were an “isolated event” and warned of making a spectacle of the slogans.</p>\n<p>“When these slogans and messages popped up, I wasn’t very concerned about who was saying these things because, at the end of the day, it’s just a handful of folks who were trying to be edgy or incendiary,” Hakim said. “I think giving it too much attention is giving them exactly what they want.”</p>\n<p>Chalking sidewalks is a violation of the UCSB posting <a

comment on the markings, but university spokesperson Andrea Estrada said in an email that “because of the numerous posting violations that have occurred recently,” the Office of Student Life (OSL) will be sending an email to all students reminding them of the posting policy and letting them know where to report violations.</p>\n<p>Hakim said he was most worried about the marginalization of

A vice chancellor at the school resigned in April 2015 amid allegations of sexual harassment, and <a href=\"http://www.dailycal.org/2016/03/10/berkeley-law-dean-resigns-amid-sexual-harassment-allegations-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier in March</a>, the dean of UC Berkeley’s School of Law resigned after a campus investigation found he had violated the university’s sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>“It was just time to say look, the sanctions need to match the seriousness of the behavior that’s substantiated,” Napolitano said in the radio interview. “We just don’t tolerate this kind of activity at the University of California, be it at Berkeley or be it at any other campus.”</p>\n<p>Under the new policy, sanctions imposed on administrators in these positions would need to be reviewed by the committee, which would then send its recommendation to the campus chancellor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As before the committee’s creation, Napolitano will have the final say as to how senior leaders are reprimanded.</span></p><div

The prosecutor alleges that Chen was one of these three men and has charged him with two separate counts of rape.</p>\n<p>One key claim in the prosecutors’ case is that Chen used two separate condoms, which the prosecutors say allows them to charge Chen with two separate rapes. The complaint says Chen “had a reasonable opportunity to reflect upon his actions and nevertheless resumed his sexually assaultive behavior and raped Jane Doe a second time.”</p>\n<p>Chen is due back in court on April 6.</p>\n<p><em>University News Editor Supriya Yelimeli contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 3, 2016 print edition of

After four minutes of solo play, more than 20 members of the ensemble picked up their violins, clarinets and bass, adding to Kalhor’s skillful strumming.</p>\n<p>Ma was the last person to begin playing, and while many of those in the audience likely came to see him, it was members of the ensemble who were front and center for much of the night.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Cristina Pato, bagpipes player for the Silk Road Ensemble from Galicia, Spain, said that “In Galicia, playing bagpipes is like playing soccer — you only have two choices.”</p>\n<p>She said that in the United States, many refer to Hispanic women as simply “Latina,” rather than focusing on their accomplishments or profession.</p>\n<p>“In Galicia, I was known as the Galician Bagpiper,” Pato said. “When I moved to the U.S., I was called Latina.”</p>\n<p>Then she burst into a song, filling the theatre with the high-pitched screams of her bagpipe as she swayed her hips and danced around the stage. The clarinetist gyrated, swinging from side to side and looking at his fellow musicians with emphatic smiles. Many of the other musicians also danced and moved around while playing, but Ma simply focused on his cello with serious ferocity, surely knowing that the audience’s eyes were flying back to him after every measure.</p>\n<p>This seriousness was contrasted at one point by a man who began using his own body for percussion, slapping his thighs, chest and at one point his buttocks, resulting in a scream from an elderly woman next to me.</p>\n<p>During one brief break from the music, a violinist said that the ensemble loved coming to Santa Barbara because of the dining options.</p>\n<p>“Musicians, they live for food,” he said. “We’ve been feasting on Lilly’s Tacos. We’re going to try and feed you back food for the soul.”</p>\n<p>When the audience returned from intermission, only four musicians took the stage, including a clarinetist, a cellist, Kalhor and Sandeep Das, who played the tabla — an eastern percussion instrument. Das went back and forth with Kalhor, challenging him with more and more complex rhythms.</p>\n<p>The instruments created such strong vibrations that it sounded like there were six musicians on stage even though often only three of the four were playing.</p>\n<p>Das said the quartet’s music was “about how we meet, about how we fall in love, about how we learn about each other’s culture.”</p>\n<p>Later, the audience was rewarded as Ma took center stage with accompaniment from only Pato on the piano.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of heads stood still as they fixated on Ma’s masterful playing, his eyes closed, his hand viciously sliding his bow back and forth on the cello.</p>\n<p>The Silk Road Ensemble is releasing a new album, <em>Sing Me Home,</em> on April 22.</p>\n<div

Rob Romero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearing an orange Santa Barbara County Jail shirt and blue pants, Chen stood behind glass in a separate room and communicated with his lawyer, Adam Pearlman, via a telephone on the wall. He did not speak except to acknowledge that he understood his right to a speedy trial would be postponed until his next trial date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pearlman argued that photographers should not be allowed to take pictures of the proceedings Tuesday because of what he said was the “potential prejudice for potential jurors seeing Mr. Chen in a jail uniform,” but the judge ultimately allowed photographs by the press.</span></p>\n<p>When Ladinig was asked if he was considering a plea deal in exchange for the two other suspects, he said, “As of now, we’re just proceeding with Mr. Chen and Mr. Chen’s case.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A preliminary hearing is set for March 2 in front of Judge Pauline Maxwell, and Pearlman indicated he would likely request bail for his client at that time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Separately, the victim filed a personal injury lawsuit against the UC Regents <a

A California Highway Patrol car was parked on the side of the street, but Waltman didn’t think twice about breezing through the intersection on his bicycle.</p>\n<p>“There were no cars on the road and it was 9 a.m.,” said Waltman, a UCSB alumnus. “I slowed down and didn’t stop. I’ve done that plenty of times in front of a cop.”</p>\n<p>Moments later, the patrol car’s lights flashed on and an officer cited Waltman for failing to stop — a $270 fine for the first offense, according to the Santa Barbara Police Department.</p>\n<p>“‘We are cracking down on it to hopefully make you guys more safe,’” Waltman recalled the officer saying. As Waltman pedaled away from the curb, he saw the officer pull over another bicyclist for running the same stop sign.</p>\n<p>While Waltman and other Isla Vistans say there has been an increase in citations for bike offenses, Officer John Gutierrez of the Santa Barbara Police Department said there is no effort by highway patrol officers to write more tickets.</p>\n<p>“We’re not told to go out there and write up bicyclists — not at all,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>The police department will be hosting a bike safety event on March 2 at the Pardall Center, after which, Gutierrez said, there may be a “ramped up increase” in citations.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez pointed to recent bike accidents in I.V., including a two-bike collision on Pardall Road <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/692109191822049280\">in January</a> that sent one person to the hospital, as evidence of the need for bicyclists to follow traffic signs.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people are riding bicycles unsafely in I.V.,” Gutierrez said.</p>\n<p>Wednesday night, Associated Students senators voted to send a<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bike-Law-Resolution.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> resolution</a> to External Affairs Committee that calls on campus police, the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office and California Highway Patrol “to allow bicycles to treat stop signs and red lights as yield signs.” The resolution will now head to A.S. External Affairs.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Senator Jerel Constantino, who drafted the bill, said because so many students already ignore the bike laws, the bill is designed “to keep the status quo.”</p>\n<p>Ashcon Minoiefar, third-year history of public policy major and College of Letters &amp; Sciences collegiate senator, said Isla Vista Foot Patrol regulates bicycle and skateboard laws inconsistently.</p>\n<p>“The crackdown on bicyclists is unreasonable, because I.V.F.P. will be very strict on biking rules . . . and then will disappear,” Minoiefar said. “I don’t think the crackdown is about safety, because the rules are not enforced consistently.”</p>\n<p>The resolution refers to a 1982 Idaho statute known as the “Idaho stop,” which allows bicyclists to roll through stop signs, after looking both ways, and to bike under red lights after stopping.</p>\n<p>“The Idaho stop is not saying you see a stop sign and you ignore it,” Constantino said. “When you see a stop sign, that should be a key to look both left and right and, if necessary, stop.”</p>\n<p>Constantino, third-year history of public policy and political science double major, said he bikes to campus from I.V. every day and drafted the bill to protect bicyclists “from a misguided prioritization of law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also calls for the California State Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown to institute a similar law statewide.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Waltman was cited, he posted a picture of his ticket on a popular UCSB Facebook group, warning other bicyclists that officers were enforcing the law.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, he was at the center of a spirited debate in the comment section about whether police should ticket bicyclists for failing to obey traffic signs.</p>\n<p>While some commenters assumed Waltman disagreed with being cited, he said he “totally deserved” the ticket.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s a little inconvenient to stop and go on a rusty old mountain bike, but when you have a culture where nobody stops and people just throw themselves into intersections, it’s dangerous,” Waltman said.</p>\n<p>Elena Rovito, fourth-year biological anthropology major, said she often bikes to class and to restaurants in I.V. Rovito said she always follows the traffic signs, but when she walks, she has to be aware of bicyclists who are not following the law.</p>\n<p>“You have to constantly be on your toes,” Rovito said. “You’ll see people biking, not looking both ways, texting, and I’ve had to jump out of the way on more than one occasion.”</p>\n<p>Sarah Garrett, first-year political science major and copy reader at the Daily Nexus, was ticketed recently for failing to stop at the corner of Camino Pescadero and Trigo Road. Garrett said she plans to enroll in a bike safety course to reduce her fine.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t think anything of it because, a couple days before, I had blown through a stop sign by a cop and nothing had happened,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>The officer told Garrett that he was trying to keep her and other bicyclists safe, but she said stopping at some intersections can be more dangerous than passing slowly through.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it would be more of a hazard to stop at certain stop signs because no one is stopping and I feel like herds of bikes might run over me,” Garrett said.</p>\n<p>Garrett now tries to avoid biking through I.V. by staying on El Colegio Road for as long as possible.

Rob Romero said Chen was arrested in Alameda County on an unrelated felony drug charge, during which authorities swabbed the inside of his mouth for DNA, ultimately leading to the rape charges.</p>\n<p>When police in Alameda County ran Chen’s DNA through an FBI database, it matched evidence found at the UCSB crime scene. Chen was transferred to Santa Barbara County Jail on Wednesday, about a week after university police learned of the DNA match, Romero said.</p>\n<p>The victim filed a personal injury <strong><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/lawsuit-claims-dangerous-area-of-ucsb-led-to-rape/\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a></strong> in January alleging, among other claims, that the UCSB Police Department was “understaffed and insufficiently trained” to investigate the case.</p>\n<p>Tyrone Maho, one of two attorneys representing the victim, said Thursday that his client was “relieved” to hear about the arrest.</p>\n<p>“Our client was really pleased that this developed,” Maho said. “I’m just hoping it leads to the location and the prosecution of any other assailants involved.”</p>\n<p>Romero said that while the DNA match was a lucky break, UCPD has continued to investigate the case since 2014.</p>\n<p>“Yes, we were fortunate from the DNA hit, but we were never not motivated to solve this case,” Romero said Thursday. “We do know there’s a lawsuit out there but we’ve just been grinding and chipping away at this case.”</p>\n<p>In its statement, UCSB said, “We deeply appreciate the multiagency search that led to the uncovering and collection of DNA evidence, which has now resulted in the arrest of a suspect. This is a crucial step toward achieving justice and preventing future tragedies.”</p>\n<p>The university said that while the arrest is a step forward, “it may bring renewed pain to our student and her family.”</p>\n<p>“We keep them in our thoughts, as we have for the past two years, and we continue to offer our unwavering support and heartfelt sympathy.”</p>\n<p>Chen is currently being held without bail in Santa Barbara County Jail. He will be arraigned Feb. 16 in Santa Barbara Superior Court.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68186\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68186\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/university-police-attorney-respond-to-rape-arrest/","id":2585,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[2584,2583,2582],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/113"}},"__N_SSG":true}
