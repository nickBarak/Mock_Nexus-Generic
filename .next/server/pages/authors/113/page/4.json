Chen, 21, charged in the 2014 rape of a UCSB student.<em> Courtesy of UCSB Police Department</em></p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara Police arrested one man Wednesday in connection with the February 2014 violent rape and assault of a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>Daniel J. Chen, 21, of San Ramon, Calif., was arrested by UCSB Police Wednesday and charged with four felonies: rape by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury; rape in cooperation with another person; battery; and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Chen is being held in Santa Barbara County Jail without bail. He was arrested in Alameda County in January on an unrelated felony charge, according to the press release, and his DNA was matched to DNA from the crime scene, next to UCSB’s track.</p>\n<p>Chen’s Facebook profile says he graduated from Northgate High School in Walnut Creek, Calif. in 2012. Chen attended UCSB from September 2012 to December 2013, according to UCPD.</p>\n<p>The female victim was raped and assaulted by three men in the early hours of Feb. 23, 2014, after being taken from Isla Vista to a secluded location next to UCSB’s track. Shortly after the incident, UCPD <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucpd-releases-sketches-of-sexual-assault-case-suspects/\">released a sketch</a> of two of the three suspects, depicting two Asian men.</p>\n<p>The victim of the crime filed a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/\">lawsuit</a> against the University of California in January alleging that the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/lawsuit-claims-dangerous-area-of-ucsb-led-to-rape/\">area of the attack was not properly maintained</a> by the university, UCSB’s Police Department had not properly investigated the case and that UCSB “skewed” its sexual assault figures to attract prospective students.</p>\n<p>In January, Tyrone Maho, an attorney for the victim, told the <em>Daily Nexus</em> he hoped the lawsuit would reinvigorate the university’s investigation into the assault.</p>\n<p>“Our hope with this whole thing is not only to draw attention to what the university did to basically allow this activity to take place … but also to help with the appeal to find the perpetrators because it has been two years and UC police have not found the suspects,” Maho said in January.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office, Department of Justice Crime Lab and the FBI assisted in Chen’s arrest.</p>\n<p>Chen will appear in Santa Barbara Superior Court on Feb. 16.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

impossible for anyone to see or hear what was happening within the space” because of foliage that stretched for about a block. Satellite images from Google Earth show that a significant number of trees and shrubbery were removed within six months of the attack, making the location more visible from bordering bike paths and the corner of El Colegio Road and Stadium Road.</p>\n<p>Attorneys Tyrone Maho and Joshua Lynn are representing the female victim, whom the lawsuit refers to as Jane Doe, against the University of California Regents.

The lawsuit alleges that the UCSB Police Department was “understaffed and insufficiently trained” to investigate the attack.</p>\n<p>“We are dismayed that [UCPD has] not been able to find the suspects and the longer this goes on, the more difficult this is going to be,” Maho said. “Bringing this to the public’s attention by the way of the lawsuit, this will hopefully bring some witnesses forward who have some sort of information.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuit says a rape kit was performed shortly after the assault, but that it is “missing significant documentation” and does not include photos of the student’s injuries.</p>\n<p>The victim is requesting damages from the university but has not specified an amount. When a number is known, the lawsuit states, the plaintiff will “amend this Complaint and allege said amounts.”</p>\n<p>Maho and Lynn are representing the victim on a contingency basis, meaning they will not be paid for their time unless the victim is rewarded.</p>\n<p>UCSB released a statement Wednesday in response to the lawsuit, saying the safety of students is the university’s highest priority and that student cases are treated with “survivor-centered” support.</p>\n<p>“While we cannot pretend to comprehend the depth of pain and anguish our student has endured, we continue to offer our heartfelt sympathy and unwaveringly and persistently provide as much support as we possibly can,” the statement reads. “While this remains an active and ongoing criminal investigation, our campus would like to again ask the community to report any information related to this incident.”</p>\n<p>A representative from attorney Jonathan Miller’s office, based in Santa Barbara, confirmed that Miller is defending the university in this lawsuit, but offered no additional comment.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Police Department, UC Office of the President and UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>An initial conference between lawyers is scheduled for May 27 in front of Judge Donna Geck.</p>\n<p>Anyone with information is encouraged to call

The lawsuit calls the attack “the worst case of sexual assault” at UCSB and claims the university is culpable because it did not adequately maintain an overgrown area between the UCSB track and tennis courts, where the attack occurred. The lawsuit states the area was “so overgrown with foliage that it resembled a maze, enticing the public to hide and get lost in it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67673\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67673\" data-attachment-id=\"67673\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/victim-of-on-campus-rape-files-lawsuit-against-uc-regents/screen-shot-2016-01-27-at-2-32-10-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?fit=1070%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1070,555\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2016-01-27 at 2.32.10 AM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?fit=250%2C130&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?fit=888%2C460&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-67673\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM-1024x531.png?resize=888%2C460\" alt=\"The lawsuit states student was attacked between the track and tennis courts (via Google)\" width=\"888\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?resize=1024%2C531&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?resize=250%2C130&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?resize=768%2C398&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-27-at-2.32.10-AM.png?w=1070&amp;ssl=1 1070w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67673\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The lawsuit states the student was attacked between UCSB’s track and tennis courts (via Google)</p></div>\n<p>The lawsuit, filed in Santa Barbara Superior Court by attorneys Tyrone Maho and Joshua Lynn, states “UCSB had previously received several complaints that crimes had occurred” in the same area, but that no “reasonable precautions had been taken” to protect students.</p>\n<p>“Instead, UCSB tolerated the ongoing dark and overgrown foliage area and fostered a dangerous and crime susceptible environment for its students,” the lawsuit says.</p>\n<p>The complaint states that it would have been “neither cost prohibitive nor difficult” for UCSB to “keep this area clear, lighted, and safe for UCSB students.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after the attack in 2014, the campus police department <span style=\"color: red;\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/ucpd-releases-sketches-of-sexual-assault-case-suspects/\" target=\"_blank\">released a sketch</a> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">of two of the three men</span></span> and distributed wanted posters throughout I.V.

deputies have been testing body-worn video cameras for about a year, and all 16 may be wearing the cameras in the spring, according to Sol Linver, commander of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping by the end of next quarter we’ll have an idea which [camera to purchase],” Linver said. This would begin the next phase of the body camera pilot program, outfitting all Santa Barbara County deputies who are “not routinely in cars” with one of five potential body camera brands, something Linver hopes to do by April. The department has been evaluating the use of body cameras over the last year, attempting to determine the most effective camera, select an affordable managing program and server for viewing and storing video and obtain the money to purchase these items.</p>\n<p>Police departments across the country have increasingly turned to body cameras amid calls for transparency from activists and politicians after a series of highly publicized and controversial deaths at the hands of police in Ferguson, Mo., Staten Island, N.Y. and Baltimore. Linver said this sudden spike in demand forced camera companies to hastily develop and sell cameras, flooding the market with subpar products.</p>\n<p>Now that the initial eagerness of police departments is ebbing, Linver said, officials are “starting to slow everybody down” and ask for a camera “that’s going to last — not something that’s just going to go out there so we can say we have body cameras.”</p>\n<p>Los Angeles officials recently balked at approving a $57 million <a href=\"http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2015/15-0479-S2_misc_1_11-25-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> to purchase more than 6,000 body cameras for the LAPD. City council members delayed the vote amid critics’ concerns that the city relied too heavily on another county’s pilot program and only tested two camera brands itself.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department has taken a different approach, independently evaluating five brands of body cameras — VidMic, VidCam, BodyCam, TASER and COBAN — based on durability, nighttime video quality, charging time, battery life, time and date stamping, internal memory, still image quality and more.</p>\n<p>“We chose to do the pilot project and do this right before we go out there and spend a great deal of money on cameras,” said Linver, who was also the project manager of the pilot program. “I don’t want to spend 20 or 30 thousand dollars on cameras that are only going to last one year. That’s not being frugal — that’s not what the taxpayers expect from us.”</p>\n<p>Linver emphasized the importance of thoroughly evaluating each product during the trial before committing to one brand. He pointedly recalled one camera model having “major software issues” until the company’s CEO traveled to Santa Barbara and replaced all of the faulty cameras with newer versions.</p>\n<p>A flawed camera was a hassle then, but during interactions between police officers and civilians, a flaw could mean losing crucial evidence.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking for something that can handle rain, can handle dust, can handle jarring,” Linver said. “If I’ve got a deputy who’s rolling around — unfortunately — with someone on the ground or involved in a fight, I don’t want the camera to just stop. That’s really when I need it.”</p>\n<p>Linver said the cameras range from about $200 for the TASER brand to nearly $500 for the VidMic, but that the greatest expense is in storing recorded video.</p>\n<p>The department estimates that each camera will produce, on average, slightly less than two terabytes of data per year, roughly equivalent to half a million songs in an iTunes library. Linver said in December that he had just purchased a 72 TB server for $24,000 to store video from car and body-worn cameras.</p>\n<p>Linver said he had looked into federal grants — which almost exclusively apply to the hardware, rather than storage expenses — and also plans to explore other means of funding, such as drawing from the department’s general fund or requesting funds from the county Board of Supervisors or Police Foundation.</p>\n<p>Matthew West, a deputy at the IVFP station, voluntarily purchased his own body camera in November of 2014 and said he uses it as an aid to write detailed reports and protect himself from potentially unfounded claims of excessive force.</p>\n<p>“With everything that’s been going on in the media, obviously I know what I’m doing is right, but I want to protect myself,” West said. “I don’t want it to be my word against their word. Times have changed, and if I have video and it clearly shows something, that’s what happened, it’s on the video.”</p>\n<p>West said he thought officers in the foot patrol office were generally supportive of implementing body cameras, and said he “highly recommends” using them in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“Especially out here is where they’re needed, because [IVFP has] one car with a video camera, but 90 percent of the time, we’re walking around,” West said.</p>\n<p>The IVFP office comprises the largest group of deputies in the county who spend the majority of their time on bicycle or on foot, according to Linver.</p>\n<p>Linver said deputies are increasingly seeing cameras as an “important, helpful tool,” and deputies in places like Goleta and Carpinteria have purchased their own cameras as well.</p>\n<p>“Ten or 12 years ago … you had some deputies who wanted to drive the car where the camera didn’t work,” Linver said. “Now they’re all like, ‘Hey, my camera doesn’t work, I don’t want to go out there in the field,’ because our deputies nowadays realize the benefit of having video.”</p>\n<p>West said his body camera, made by Wolfcom, allows him to pay more attention to people rather than being buried in his notepad.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to take such accurate notes because ultimately you’re going to have everything on video,” West said. “If it’s a pretty complex case or investigation, you can get specific quotes from people when you’re writing your report.”</p>\n<p>Section 450.9 of the department’s policy manual, parts of which were obtained through a public records request by the<em> Daily Nexus</em>, states members of the sheriff’s office “should review their recordings as a resource” when preparing written reports.</p>\n<p>“With perception, sometimes you look at a video and you say, ‘oh, that’s what happened,’” Linver said. “When there is a complaint filed against an officer or deputy, [recordings are] a tool that we can look at.”</p>\n<p>“There are also times where officers will do things wrong,” Linver said. “Sometimes they don’t know the things they’re doing are wrong, and we work with training and things to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”</p>\n<p>The department’s policy manual also says, “Uniformed members should wear the recorder in a conspicuous manner or otherwise notify persons that they are being recorded, whenever possible.”</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Jeffrey Greene said that citizens’ behavior can change when they know they are being recorded.</p>\n<p>“You tell them, ‘I’m recording you, so keep up what you’re doing and let the judge or your parents see that,’ and immediately, their behavior changes,” Greene said, adding that this tactic is not as effective in I.V., where unruly students are often “already drunk and typically beyond caring mode.”</p>\n<p>Whether a body camera is a deputy’s personal device or part of the pilot program, the recordings are uploaded to the department’s server and could potentially be used in investigations.</p>\n<p>Greene said video recordings are retained by the department for three years, unless they are “deemed necessary for some type of criminal [investigation] or tagged for evidence in a crime.”</p>\n<p>Linver said he had already used body camera footage from the pilot program in a “use of force” investigation in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Joyce Dudley, Santa Barbara County’s district attorney, said she always welcomes more evidence, but that body cameras may not be as conclusive as some expect.</p>\n<p>“Whether [body cameras] would further justice or not is yet to be seen,” Dudley said. “Think about filmmakers — filmmakers choose their angle, filmmakers choose what they want to portray, and I think it’s the same thing for cell phone video and body cameras.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said she has seen juries perceive video to be an infallible piece of evidence, when it may not tell the whole story.</p>\n<p>“Because I’ve seen the other part — that is, [footage] only from a certain angle and for a certain amount of time — I’ve seen injustice,” Dudley said. “I’m very frustrated with body cams because with witnesses,  juries could sit there and watch people as they describe what happened and judge their credibility, and now juries are more likely to just believe the videotape and not judge what they saw.”</p>\n<p>For this reason, Dudley said, it’s important that any witnesses with footage of a controversial event make their video accessible.</p>\n<p>“The more tapes we have, the better,” Dudley said. “Get those tapes in.”</p>\n<p>A version of

UCSB Library — totaling 150,000 square feet — opened on Monday.</p>\n<p>The “Addition and Renovation Project,” which began in August 2013, made the building more fire and earthquake safe, added computers, created new faculty and graduate student study rooms and increased study space by 20 percent. Students were able to walk through the new paseo entrance Monday and explore 60,000 square feet and three stories of brand new space, which students hope will alleviate library traffic, especially during finals week.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Metzger, assistant university librarian for outreach and academic collaboration, said plans for the renovation had been “in the works for almost two decades,” due partially to rising enrollment.</p>\n<p>“If you have spent any time in the library, you have seen that it’s really packed with students all the time,” Metzger said. “By the time we began [construction], the library hadn’t been touched in 35 years.”</p>\n<p>The project was largely made possible by an approximately $80 million state grant, and Metzger said the library is “continuing to raise money for furnishings, technology, collections and other initiatives.”</p>\n<p>The construction appeared to be ahead of schedule in the summer, and school officials estimated the library would open earlier than expected, but the construction was completed in line with the initial timeframe.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67162\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67162\" data-attachment-id=\"67162\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-05/renovated-library-portions/newlibrary_eric-swenson-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1451912299\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"140\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"New Library Opening\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67162\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=650%2C434\" alt=\"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus\" width=\"650\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NewLibrary_Eric-Swenson-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Metzger said the first few students in the building Monday encountered some surprises, and she warned students to expect some kinks that will be worked out in the coming days.</p>\n<p>“There were definitely some hiccups on opening day morning,” Metzger said. “There were some alarms going off, some doors opening that shouldn’t be opening. People should be a little bit patient with coming back.”</p>\n<p>Students in the library Monday evening said they were enjoying the new library, though, and praised its new design and spaces.</p>\n<p>“I love it. It’s a shocking difference from the old library; the new spaces are so nice,” third-year political science major Cristina Hernandez said. “I use the computers in the library all the time, so having all these new options of where to do that is going to be good.”</p>\n<p>Hernandez lives on Sabado Tarde Road in Isla Vista, which she said has led her to rely on the library for a quiet study space.</p>\n<p>“I can’t study in my apartment,” Hernandez said. “I just will never get homework done there. If I want to get anything done, I’m always at the library.”</p>\n<p>The University of California system plans to enroll 5,000 additional in-state students among its nine campuses next year, and 5,000 more over the subsequent two years. Hernandez said she thought the renovations were necessary to keep up with the new students.</p>\n<p>“Within my last couple of years, I could already tell the library was getting more and more packed every year, so it definitely came at a good time,” Hernandez said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Ian Davis works at the circulation desk and said he was enjoying his first shift in the new library.</p>\n<p>“The old space, we worked at circulation over there and it was a lot more cramped,” Davis said. “Here, we obviously have this huge area, which is pretty nice.”</p>\n<p>Davis said he was most excited for the ability to reserve study areas online, “so you don’t have to have someone in your group get there at 8 a.m. and kind of post up. You can do it on your own time which is more convenient for everyone.”</p>\n<p>Third-year electrical engineering major Chris Claycomb was reading a book in one of the study areas in the new library Monday evening, and said he liked being able to “kill some time” before making the commute home to downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Claycomb left UCSB after his sophomore year to study at the United States Naval Academy and is returning this year to complete his degree. He said he remembered a much busier library before the addition.</p>\n<p>“I just remember you would go to the old library and, at least during finals and midterms, you would have to wander three floors to find a room, especially if you were with a group of people,” Claycomb said.</p>\n<p>For this reason, Claycomb said he “only used the library a few times” before the addition, but thought he would “give it a shot” after seeing the addition and renovations.</p>\n<p>There will be a formal opening for the library on Jan. 13, when Chancellor Henry T. Yang will speak and A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal will announce that the senior class gift will be designated for the library, according to Metzger.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Later on Thursday, a spokesperson from the UC Office of the President (UCOP) confirmed the University’s shares in private prisons, which were part of a broader portfolio, had been sold on Dec. 1.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCOP’s Director of Media Relations Dianne Klein said after <a href=\"http://afrikanblackcoalition.org/2015/11/30/university-of-california-has-millions-invested-in-private-prisons/\" target=\"_blank\">ABC announced in November that UC had $25 million invested in private prisons</a>, the University decided to sell its shares in the companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students brought this to our attention, and based on that, we looked at our investments in private prisons, which total less than $30 million, and we decided to sell them — they are gone,” Klein said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klein said UC does not issue statements on divestments, but does routinely review its investments, totaling $91 billion, to see if they are financially sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We see the issue of private prisons as: Is that really sustainable? Is that going to make us money in the long term? And we don’t think so for these social reasons,” Klein said. “From a risk perspective, it didn’t make sense to hold on to these assets.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB alumnus and Political Director of ABC Yoel Haile said UC’s investments in private prisons supported a system that disproportionately harms poor people and people of color.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The investments were] a practical example of how the UC system doesn’t value black lives or immigrant lives or poor lives because it is underwriting an enterprise that is systematically targeting our people,” Haile said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haile said there is a contradiction between UC’s public stance and the corporations in which it is invested financially.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the UC system is the largest public institution in the country and is investing millions of dollars into [private prisons] … the message is obviously that you support this because, even if you say rhetorically that you don’t, your money is speaking,” Haile said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haile said ABC members have been speaking with UCOP Chief Investment Officer of the Regents Jagdeep Singh Bachher since August, and are hopeful that his office continues to work with the coalition on its additional demands, which include issuing quarterly investment reports and divesting $425 million from Wells Fargo, which owns shares in private prisons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Bachher] has stated that he wants to partner with us, and we hope that he becomes a good partner in this matter,” Haile said. “We really hope that the UC does the right thing. And if it doesn’t, then it’s going to have to deal with black students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he was looking forward to discussing the issue more with students in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I appreciate the Afrikan Black Coalition and the Black Student Union bringing up this current issue, and we look forward to having more dialogue and discussion with our ABC and BSU students … at upcoming Regents meetings,” Yang said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Black Student Union Political Chair and fourth-year environmental studies major Nia Mitchell said she sees this as one step toward a larger goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re getting the ball rolling,” Mitchell said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this is just the beginning of seeing what black unity and solidarity among people of color can do for the equity of all of our people.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-66805\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">John Clow/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative held a public meeting Tuesday in the Isla Vista Clinic building to discuss which services should be the first to receive funding if I.V. becomes a Community Service District (CSD) in the Nov. 2016 county elections.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday’s meeting was the fifth of 11 meetings the Initiate organized for community members to discuss the framework and specific services that may be offered in a CSD. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the meeting, the group of about 15 attendees made provisional plans to spend $119,000 out of the $255,000 they expect to have after the CSD’s administration costs.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The CSD’s budget for funding services would come from revenue from a Utility User Tax (UUT), as stipulated in Assemblymember Das Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group tentatively decided to ask the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to approve the following budget: $50,000 for hiring a grant writer, $30,000 to begin developing a new parking program, $25,000 for a tenant-landlord mediation program, $8,000 for a Municipal Advisory Council (M.A.C.) and $6,000 to remove graffiti, possibly by painting murals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy CEO of Santa Barbara County Martin Erickson said forming a CSD in I.V. through AB 3 might lead to more cooperation between the university, county and I.V. governance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think part of AB 3’s existence is going to have the County and UCSB look at this area differently and [result in] more partnerships,” Erickson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Organizer for Williams’ office Darcel Elliott said although the CSD will have a relatively small budget, it will be able to make significant improvements in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing about the CSD is it’s going to do things and those things are going to have an impact on Isla Vista,” Elliott said. “These things are not going to cost very much, but they’re going to do a lot for the community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elliott said the group’s tentative planning served an important purpose, even though it did not result in an official budget.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not just all out here running around like crazy … we are figuring it out now, we do have plans already in process; we are ready for governance; we can do this,” Elliott said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB professor of economics Lanny Ebenstein said spending $50,000 on a grant writer would be a good decision because it could yield a positive return.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It seems like a very good idea because that’s a position that could generate several times its cost,” Ebenstein said.</span></p>\n<div

it.”</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group plans to discuss funding for a new police program and increased lighting of public parks and sidewalks in I.V. at future meetings, the next

The most common method of ingesting 25I-NBOMe is orally. The most prevalent street names for this drug are ‘25I’ or ‘N-Bomb.’ Although 25I-NBOMe has been around for more than 12 years, recreational abuse rates for the drug have increased dramatically in the past few years, resulting in a significant number of hospitalizations for overdoses, as well as deaths. Ingestion of 25I-NBOMe can result in seizures, aggression, self-harm and agitation, distortions in space and time, psychosis-like symptoms, an abnormally rapid heart rate, increased body temperature, and rapid breakdown of muscle tissue. Existing case reports of 25I-NBOMe abuse indicates that there is a substantial risk of toxicity after ingesting limited quantities of this hallucinogenic substance. Ketamine is an anesthetic, with hallucinogenic properties. Common street names for ketamine, include ‘K’ and ‘Vitamin K,’ among many others. Although it was developed in the early 1960’s as an anesthetic, its popularity as a recreational hallucinogenic drug has increased dramatically in the past ten years as result of its association with “rave” dances. Misuse of ketamine can result in hallucinations, delirium, irrational behavior and progress into cardiovascular and respiratory irregularities.</em></p>\n<p>Sanchez was also under the influence of marijuana at the time of his death, according to the statement.</p>\n<p>Read the full press release below:</p>\n<p style=\" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;

through UC Santa Barbara’s campus on Thursday, joining more than 100 campuses nationwide in the Million Student March, a movement demanding free tuition, the elimination of student debt and a $15 minimum wage.</p>\n<p>The march was the largest protest on UCSB’s campus in recent memory and stoked the embers of other activist movements: many students wore black to show solidarity with University of Missouri protesters, sported Bernie Sanders pins or held up Black Lives Matter signs. Approximately a dozen organizers labored to direct the larger-than-expected crowd as they marched from Storke Tower to Cheadle Hall and back while documenting the march on social media.

Yang said he supports students and sees the need for a “vital dialogue” on how to make public higher education accessible.</p>\n<p>“We will continue to send a strong message to our elected officials about the value of the University of California and the need to keep higher education accessible and affordable to all Californians,” Yang said in the statement.</p>\n<p>A.S. vice president for statewide affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Mohsin Mirza said organizers were nervous about how many people would attend the protest until hundreds of students arrived on the steps of Storke Tower at noon.</p>\n<p>“We were all nervous about how many students we could get to turn out to make this statement,” Mirza said. “It was all about making the loudest statement possible that we, as a generation, agree with these three demands.”</p>\n<p>Once a few hundred students gathered, organizers led the march across campus as administrators and students looked on.

Hannah-Beth Jackson recently asked her if she will attend law school, and Garcia replied she was unsure if she can afford it.</p>\n<p>“I have two younger brothers who also have dreams that I have to think about,” Garcia said. “My father’s a gardener and my mother’s a housekeeper — they don’t make a lot of money. I’m in a position where I have to think about other people’s futures as well and determine how much I can invest in mine.”</p>\n<p>The march demonstrated a re-emergence of student mobilization that has historically driven fundamental change in society, according to Jones.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps the stark realities of being priced out of higher education or being saddled with five or six-figure debt is enough to motivate more people to say ‘this is not right’ and to do something about it,” Jones said.</p>\n<p><em>Assistant News Editor Juliet Bachtel and Reporter Olivia Pla contributed

White said. “Many of our students in our elementary schools are taught with rose-colored glasses and dumbed down . . . they don’t understand the real history of the United States.”</p>\n<p>White said it is important for faculty to show support for student movements.</p>\n<p>“This is many students’ first foray into resistance and I need to support that,” White said. “It’s about having an ethical conversation around resisting anti-blackness.”</p>\n<p>Multiple attendees, including BSU member and first-year psychology major Lauryn Westbrook, voiced concern with a common phrase used against the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>“When you say ‘all lives matter,’ you can say that, and yes that’s true, but it’s the fact that my black body is threatened just because it’s black,” Westbrook said. “All lives are not being targeted — colored people’s lives are being targeted.”</p>\n<p>As members of the church began to clean up Woodstock’s Pizza boxes, Cox explained the importance of <span

met.</p>\n<p>“That’s what it’s about,” Cox said. “It’s about making a one-on-one connection, because if you make a one-on-one connection, suddenly the other person isn’t the other, it’s Randy, Melissa, Kayla.”</p>\n<p>Third-year art history major Abraham Lizama said there is a disconnect between Isla Vista’s perceived diversity and its actual representation of students of color.</p>\n<p>“As a resident of this community for my entire life, I’ve seen a lot change,” Lizama said. “How democratic, liberal and diverse this community claims to be, it’s just a façade. <span class=\"aBn\"

California’s postdoctoral scholars voted overwhelmingly to ratify a one-year agreement with the University between Oct. 19 and 27, ending long and sometimes tense negotiations between the UC postdoc union (UAW 5810) and the UC.</p>\n<p>The agreement, which instates yearly raises, increases health care coverage and loosens restrictions on international postdocs, was ratified by 98.8 percent of postdocs in a count of 3,471 to 42. Negotiations came down to the last hour on Oct. 1, with postdocs threatening to strike. After having to extend the previous contract to Oct. 9, the two sides reached a new one-year contract which the union ultimately ratified Oct. 27.</p>\n<p>The union, which represents more than 6,000 postdocs at all UC campuses, charged the University with “bad faith bargaining” and “refusing to provide the Union with information” necessary for negotiations in a document submitted Sept. 18 to California’s Public Employment Relations Board.</p>\n<p>Although the union never actually went on strike, president of the postdoc union Anke Schennink said she believes the threat of a strike led to concessions from UC negotiators who were “definitely aware” of the strike.</p>\n<p>“[The strike] was not mentioned at the bargaining table itself, but it came up in conversations in the hallway,” Schennink said. “We were willing to go on strike, and we were willing to prepare for that if the University hadn’t made any moves towards us.”</p>\n<p>Director of the UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program Mark Lawson said the agreement is an “accomplishment” for both sides.</p>\n<p>“I think it is important to look at the big picture and be happy that the UC and the postdoc representation are able to come to an agreement,” Lawson said in an email.</p>\n<p>The previous deal had run for three years, and Schennink said the new one-year contract means the union is already preparing for next year’s negotiations.</p>\n<p>“We have already started making plans and are already working on our strategy for next year,” Schennink said. “There is really no plan to relax.”</p>\n<p>The one-year time frame also allows the University and the union to get right to work on issues where there is common ground, according to Schennink.</p>\n<p>“We made some improvements and they are important, but there are also some other improvements that both sides wanted to see, definitely in terms of gender equity and childcare reimbursements,” Schennink said. “With a one-year contract, more post-docs will have more opportunity to participate and express their views and say what’s important.”</p>\n<p>Schennink said female postdocs face additional difficulties, referring to a UC Berkeley professor who was accused of kissing and groping female students against their will.</p>\n<p>“As a postdoc, you are in a lot of ways dependent on your professor,” Schennink said. “A professor in your postdoc can make or break your career.”</p>\n<p>In October, Schennink said members of the negotiating team “don’t respect postdocs.” When asked if that is still the case, she said the new contract would not immediately change that feeling.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that changes in a month or in a couple of months,” Schennink said. “I think this takes years, given how lengthy the process was for bargaining … and how ridiculous and absurd the University’s comments were.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara unit chair for the union and postdoctoral fellow in UCSB’s materials department Patrick Callahan said he voted for the deal and expected it to pass.</p>\n<p>“I did expect [the vote] to be about as overwhelming as it was,” Callahan said. “We didn’t really lose anything so I’m not really surprised.”</p>\n<p>Callahan said while other postdocs would benefit from the contract, his job would not change much, if at all.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we were really fighting for was protections for international postdocs, but I’m not an international postdoc so that doesn’t really affect me,” Callahan said. “I don’t expect things to change for me, but for other people I’m sure it will make some difference.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

“With Justice for All in a Changing America” Wednesday night at Campbell Hall.</p>\n<p>The lecture, hosted by the Walter H. Capps Center for the Study of Ethics, Religion and Public Life, highlighted recent social justice issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement, student activism and two of Dees’ most notable lawsuits against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Dees earned a law degree from the University of Alabama in 1960, after which he founded the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, a nonprofit legal advocacy specializing in civil rights and combating hate and intolerance. In 2006, the National Law Journal included Dees in its list of the top 100 most influential lawyers in America.</p>\n<p>Dees said some people feel threatened by the increase of diversity in American in recent years.</p>\n<p>“It seems like America’s changed a lot in 15 years. This changing demographics and what it portends for the next 20, 30 years, it’s creating an enormous fear — a fear for those people who felt that they were privileged,” Dees said.</p>\n<p>According to Dees, “xenophobia” becomes more prevalent as cultures mix. Providing an example of this, Dees said he once represented Vietnamese fishermen after white fishermen mistreated them in Houston, Texas in 1981.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t long before they were out-fishing the American fishermen,” Dees said. “There’s no other way to put it but the American fishermen got jealous.”</p>\n<p>Dees said the white fishermen enlisted the help of the KKK, but he won the case on behalf of the Vietnamese one day before the shrimping season began, at which time the United States Marshals began protecting the Vietnamese fishermen.</p>\n<p>Dees said a television network that “starts with the letter F” spreads distorted information in order to create a reactionary response that spreads hate and intolerance.</p>\n<p>“We have mainstream hate in America and it’s because of these changing demographics,” Dees said. “America is great because of its diversity, not in spite of it.”</p>\n<p>Dees said he is disappointed by how popular Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has become and disapproves of his plan to deport millions of immigrants.</p>\n<p>“It’s saddening that the American public would buy into this,” Dees said. “Facts don’t seem to matter when you have a demigod leading the pack.”</p>\n<p>According to Dees, “98 percent of police officers” in the United States are good people, but Americans, especially racial minorities, are being victimized by the remaining two percent.</p>\n<p>“Innocent African-Americans and others are being shot by trigger-happy police officers,” Dees said.</p>\n<p>Walter H. Capps Center Public Service Intern and fourth-year global studies major Lindsay Apperson said Dees’ activism is inspiring, especially given his continued work at the age of 78.</p>\n<p>“He has done so much incredible social work and empowered a lot of marginalized populations,” Apperson said. “He’s … still fighting court cases against injustices. It’s pretty incredible.”</p>\n<p>Apperson said she was surprised when she saw the majority of the audience was not students, but rather older attendees.</p>\n<p>“It was a lot of more elderly members of the greater Santa Barbara community than students, which I thought was a little disappointing,” Apperson said.</p>\n<p>Dees said students have a chance to participate in the ongoing movement for tolerance and civil rights.</p>\n<p>“To the students here tonight: you have a front-row seat on that march for justice,” Dees said. “You can either sit on that seat or become involved.”</p><div

According to the new policy, any University employee who is not a “confidential resource” — including resident assistants, teaching assistants and any other student employees</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who hears about possible sexual assault must notify the Title IX office.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a draft of the policy sent to UC campuses, University of California Office of the President (UCOP) has asked faculty, staff and students from all UC campuses to review the 25-page policy and submit comments by the end of October, after which UC’s Policy Work Group will review the suggestions and complete a final draft by January 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UConsent Coordinator, Take Back the Night Co-Chair and fourth-year global and feminist studies double-major Ashley Morgan helped organize the forum and said it was important to hold an event during which a variety of people could have their voices heard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted different perspectives from all different groups and backgrounds,” Morgan said. “Because we are educated on [the policy], we might not be able to come up with questions or not be able to get out of a certain tunnel vision, so it’s great to have all these different perspectives telling us what their concerns are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assistant Director of C.A.R.E. Briana Conway said organizations need to hear specific student needs in order to best serve them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best of intentions — through policy and administration — if [they are] not speaking to the population who we’re trying to serve, then we’re failing,” Conway said. “I love opportunities like this where we can bridge administration’s best efforts with what really speaks to our student population.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Graduate Student Association Vice President of Committees and Planning Timothy Irvine</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who helped organize the event, the new policy would mean that survivors who do not wish to report an incident would have fewer options for confidants, seeing as many people are now required to report such information to Title IX.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It reduces the amount of people who the survivor can confide in because they know if they do confide in this person, they’re putting them in a terribly awkward position,” Irvine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Jennifer Selvidge said it creates a unique problem for graduate students and teaching assistants who may be friends with their undergraduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as graduate students and we as TAs should not be mandatory reporters so that students do have an option to confide in their friends and people they may view as their friends, like their TAs,” Selvidge said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title IX coordinator Ricardo Alcaíno said the policy would not automatically lead the Title IX office to pursue the case if, for example, more damage would be caused to the survivor by launching an investigation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not like if someone is a responsible employee and they report it, we’re off to the races,” Alcaíno said. “It’s so no students on campus feel like there’s nothing to do. That’s the most important thing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Morgan, one of the “largest weaknesses” of the proposal is the absence of a mandatory minimum suspension for perpetrators. During a 13-hour sit-in in May, #NowUCSB campaigned for a four-quarter minimum suspension of students convicted of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irvine said the document should include mandatory minimum suspensions to warn students that there will be serious actions taken against perpetrators of sexual violence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of this is that people would know there will be consequences, because, so often, there are no consequences,” Irvine said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcaíno</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said that a mandatory suspension may impact whether or not survivors choose to report an incident.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most survivors want to know what’s going to happen to the respondent,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcaíno</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said. “That may determine if they’re going to come forward or how much they’re going to tell us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said the efforts of students, including the #NowUCSB sit-in, are resulting in more progressive policies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am so proud and honored to be a part of UCSB,” Conway said. “Students are at the center of all of this. I think student activism is what’s driving change at a large university.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The forum’s organizers plan to set up a public Google Doc where anyone can suggest changes to the policy draft. These suggestions will then be submitted to UC’s Policy Work Group, which is currently drafting the final policy for the president’s approval in January.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Google Doc is viewable <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UAWatvwkdamAuSIr85HLvsj52rd-n1AYufUnba281fM/edit\">here.</a></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76497ac51e6bc87edbcf761dd3f32dd6?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nicholas-bogel-burroughs/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>test description</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:sdjklfh@kjasdn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65578\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65578\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-20/new-draft-for-sexual-violence-policies-to-accept-community-input/","id":2661,"author":{"id":113,"name":"Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"},"related":[2660,2659,2658],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/113"}},"__N_SSG":true}
