<em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The decision to replace Nicoletti’s with Starbucks this fall was made largely due to concern about the finances of the University Center, which is running a near $750,000 deficit since July 2015.</p>\n<p>The UCen’s Governance Board heard presentations from three coffee companies — The Coffee Bean, Peet’s and Starbucks — for the purpose of converting Nicoletti’s into “a national brand,” according to meeting minutes.</p>\n<p>“The UCen is struggling financially,” Travis Taylor, a fourth-year sociology major and voting member of the Governance Board, said, adding that replacing Nicoletti’s is part of an effort by the UCen to reduce its $745,753 deficit.</p>\n<p>“The main factor was the revenue,” Taylor said. “That’s why we even looked into changing Nicoletti’s into a different store in the first place.”</p>\n<p>Nicoletti’s will close at the end of July, leaving at least a three-month gap until Starbucks is scheduled to open on Nov. 10, according to minutes from a Governance Board meeting in April.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70517\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a

id=\"caption-attachment-70517\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Starbucks in Isla Vista (above) will be joined by a Starbucks on campus in the fall. <em>Alex Nagase / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Jillian Stout-Blackman, third-year sociology and global studies double major and barista at Nicoletti’s, said she first found out about Starbucks in the UCen by reading the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>“I was just kind of shocked and confused and I still am because no one really knows what’s going on,” Stout-Blackman said. “It’s just weird that the employees aren’t being told what’s going on.”</p>\n<p>While Stout-Blackman said she rarely drinks Starbucks coffee, she said she would be excited to work at Starbucks because she has heard good things from her friends who work at other Starbucks locations.</p>\n<p>UCen officials say current Nicoletti’s workers will have priority in applying to work at the new Starbucks location, although they will need to go through Starbucks training.</p>\n<p>Peerless, the coffee roast served at Nicoletti’s, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will still be available at other coffee locations like The Arbor, and UCen Dining Services Director Sue Hawkins said coffee carts at the Student Resource Building and Humanities and Social Sciences Building will still be branded as “Nic’s.”</span></p>\n<p>The UCen will have to pay to renovate the new Starbucks location, but Samantha Moon, fourth-year statistics major who also votes on the board, said Starbucks is poised to make substantially more money than Nicoletti’s, although she and other officials declined to specify Nicoletti’s yearly revenue.</p>\n<p>“I don’t agree with commercialization,” Moon said. “But what it comes down to is we need to fix the financial situation of the UCen and this is the best way to do it.”</p>\n<p>Taylor said Starbucks generates, on average, about $1.1 million in revenue per store on California campuses, which he said is “hundreds of thousands of dollars” higher than the other companies’ proposals.</p>\n<p>Taylor and Moon are hopeful this money will help turn around the UCen’s declining financial situation, which they say is partially the result of services like Amazon which have vastly reduced the UCSB Bookstore’s textbook revenue.</p>\n<p>“The UCen should get a lot more foot traffic,” Taylor said. “People should come here more often and Starbucks is a great move in that direction.”</p>\n<p>Taylor said he has worked as a student employee since his first year at UCSB and is personally invested in the success of the UCen.</p>\n<p>“I want to see this building do well because I’m attached to it,” Taylor said. “This is a huge part of the UCSB campus and I think it’s not utilized as best as it could be by students. I hope Starbucks changes that.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, May 5, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

believe noise, drugs and alcohol are problems in Isla Vista. <em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Middle school and high school students convened Tuesday in Isla Vista, asking community leaders to acknowledge the need for a safe, peaceful community conducive to their busy schedules.</p>\n<p>About 35 teenage students from schools throughout Santa Barbara County presented findings from their survey of 200 I.V. residents indicating that Isla Vistans are overwhelmingly concerned about alcohol, drugs and noise in the community.</p>\n<p>For several weeks, the students split into groups and canvassed I.V., asking 200 residents — almost half of which were college students — what they found problematic in the area.</p>\n<p>Of the 200 residents surveyed, 88.5 percent said alcohol is a problem in I.V., 84 percent said drugs are a problem and 85 percent said noise is an issue on the weekends.</p>\n<p>“Some of my nights when I’m in Isla Vista doing my homework, it can be really noisy,” said one 15-year-old who presented some of the findings Tuesday. “I am a student, too.”</p>\n<p>Named “I’m a Student, Too!,” the event sought to remind UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students that there are younger students in I.V. who attend middle schools and high schools in the county.</p>\n<p>In addition to the 200 residents surveyed, the students also asked 100 locals for their favorite thing about I.V., recording responses including the beach, the warm weather, Freebirds and the Children’s Park. Nearly 80 percent of participants said they love living in I.V.</p>\n<p>The students spoke to a crowd of about 45 in the St. George Family Youth Center (formerly the I.V.

She said the noise is the most difficult part of living in I.V., adding that she often sees people smoking and drinking at a park near her house, although the problem is improving.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I’m not able to go outside to enjoy the park,” she said. “I hope it gets better. It’s gotten way better in the last few years.”</p>\n<p>Maria, a 13-year-old student at Goleta Valley Junior High, said she enjoys the beaches and getting food with friends in I.V., but gets annoyed by the noise from parties.</p>\n<p>“On weekends or holidays — Halloween or Deltopia — it gets really loud, but other days I like living here,” she said, adding that the noise “is frustrating and sometimes keeps me from sleeping.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, April 28, 2016 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div

This year, the conglomerate of volunteers hopes to register 8,000 people by May 23, the California registration deadline.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is a place of transition in people’s lives,” said Jacob Lebell, a UCSB alumnus who is registering voters. “They come here to learn, to find themselves, to let other things go and become the people that they’re going to leave as. One of the things we really hope they become going forward is voters engaged in the political process.”</p>\n<p>Lebell is on staff for Joan Hartmann’s third district supervisor campaign, but he stressed that the voter registration effort itself is completely nonpartisan and said they do not ask for whom someone plans to vote.</p>\n<p>“Our biggest priority and value — far beyond partisanship — is that people are able to access their rights if they want,” Lebell said. “A person’s vote goes much further here than it goes back home. This is going to benefit I.V. beyond them.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70079\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70079\" data-attachment-id=\"70079\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-19/local-group-registers-more-than-2000-to-vote/voter-registration-april-18/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Voter Registration April 18\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70079\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Voter-Registration_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Jacob Lebell explains the registration process to Kevin Surnip.

Even Lebell’s aunt stopped by to help register voters.</p>\n<p>Abboud said people are eager to register because of the excitement surrounding the presidential race, but that the goal of the registration is to increase turnout for the third district supervisor elections.</p>\n<p>“The main purpose of this voting registration drive is not the president at all, but it’s the county supervisor election,” Abboud said, adding that the third district is “a swing district and the students have a major say.”</p>\n<p>Elijah Ettenger, a UCSB alumnus, is working with the conglomerate as a voter register for the county’s Democratic Party. He said encouraging people, especially students, to vote by mail is important, but that simply letting voters know the primary election is during finals week is most vital.</p>\n<p>“The vote-by-mail is a component but really it’s about letting [people] know that [the primary is] Tuesday during finals week and letting them make that decision, asking them what works for them as far as getting to the polls,” Ettenger said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College students, for example, will be out of school by the June 7 primary, meaning that many of them need to prepare to mail in their vote.</p>\n<p>The registration group is hoping that between 4,000 and 5,000 vote this year, nearly half of which they expect to vote by mail.</p>\n<p>After the June 7 primaries, many Isla Vistans will be changing their addresses, meaning that they will need to register again, likely under a different polling center.</p>\n<p>“Here, almost everyone moves every year,” Abboud said. “We start from zero on July 1, in our minds, and start again.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>Not sure if you’re registered? <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ucsbcanivote\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to check your

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Pescadero Lofts, built in 2014 at 761 Camino Pescadero for nearly $10 million, brought 35 homeless Isla Vistans off the street. Managers are planning to house several more this year. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>A new count and survey shows a slight increase in the number of homeless in Isla Vista from last year but a decrease of nearly 50 percent since 2013.</p>\n<p>The survey by the Central Coast Collaborative on Homelessness (C3H) was conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the Pescadero Lofts, a nearly $10 million complex that opened in 2014 to bring 35 homeless Isla Vistans off the streets.</p>\n<p>Volunteers, many of whom were UC Santa Barbara students, counted 19 homeless people in I.V. this April using a smartphone app to determine their “vulnerability score” based on questions about income, health, substance abuse and duration of homelessness.</p>\n<p>This year’s count is up slightly from 13 in January 2015 — a month after the lofts opened — but is a significant decrease from 34 in 2013.</p>\n<p>One reason the number of homeless may have increased from last year is that all of the previous year’s surveys (2011, 2013, 2015) were conducted in January when it is colder, while this year’s survey took place in April.</p>\n<p>The most recent survey, however, was conducted over a smaller area than in past years, spanning from UCSB to the Devereux Lagoon and from El Colegio Road to the beach, omitting the Ellwood area in Goleta for the first time.</p>\n<p>After signing a confidentiality agreement, volunteers were instructed to approach people they believed were homeless, report the person’s current location and ask where they had slept the previous night. People who said they slept outside of I.V. were not counted in the survey.</p>\n<p>“For us to really be able to help people, we need to know who they are, where they are and what they need,” said Luke Barrett, the regional coordinator for C3H in South Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>C3H will select up to 10 of I.V.’s most vulnerable homeless and move them into permanent housing, either in the Pescadero Lofts or at other locations such as Friendship Manor or veteran housing.</p>\n<p>Chuck Flacks, executive editor of C3H, said I.V. poses unique obstacles to organizations helping the homeless because some people come to I.V. with little more than the clothes on their back.</p>\n<p>“I.V. has historically been a community of openness — almost an experimental community,” Flacks said. “Since the ‘60s and before, I.V. was a kind of utopian place. There are plenty of people who kind of come to Isla Vista to just be in this utopian environment.”</p>\n<p>Jennifer Ferraez, on-site resident manager for the Pescadero Lofts, said that I.V. has a “unique chronic homeless population,” noting that I.V. is 15 miles from the nearest shelter despite the fact that I.V.’s homeless are more likely to have mental health issues than those in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“There are people living [in the lofts] or on the waiting list who truly don’t want to live downtown and don’t feel supported downtown,” Ferraez said. “They are isolated from all supportive services besides the I.V. Clinic.”</p>\n<p>Ferraez said there is an “overrepresentation of chronic alcoholism” in I.V.’s homeless population, something she said may be due to the “high accessibility of alcohol in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>The smartphone survey allows C3H to help I.V.’s unique homeless population by quantifying the vulnerability of each homeless person in I.V. Barrett said this “evidence-based” approach gives the homeless “leverage against the system and the bureaucratic nightmare of low-income housing.”</p>\n<p>Many of the initial 35 people placed in the lofts in 2014 were chronic drug users, Barrett said, and are now doing “tremendously better.” He attributes this to the housing itself, but also the access to food, social care, health care and mental health services that the lofts provide.</p>\n<p>Barrett said the fact that the homeless population is still far below its 2013 level is evidence against the idea that if you build services like the Pescadero Lofts, homeless people will come to the area. However, Barrett said there is still much to be done to make sure all homeless people in I.V. have access to the services they need.</p>\n<p>“We know there are some people out there for sure and we have got to figure out how to help them,” Barrett said. “We need to know their names, to know what they look like, to know their needs.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kaitlyn Tang contributed

Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) showed its support Thursday for 10 new receptacles in the I.V. business district and at beach access points, voting 4-0 to recommend their installation.

the new receptacles would be located at beach access points on Del Playa Dr., four would be around the business district loop and one would be at the end of Pardall Road by the tunnel between I.V. and UCSB.</p>\n<p>All four IVRPD members were enthusiastic about the receptacles (Director Dave Hubbard was absent), and IVRPD Chair Pegeen Soutar said she thought they were “so necessary.”</p>\n<p>“I’m amazed how many people just thoughtlessly [throw their cigarettes on the ground],” Soutar said. “Even smart, intelligent people I know do that.”</p>\n<p>Jeremy Levine, a first-year economics major and the volunteer chair for the Environmental Affairs Board, remained skeptical about the receptacles’ impact on littering students.</p>\n<p>“The fact that it’s so much of a problem means that a few receptacles in nice places might make a little difference, but overall I don’t think people will even be aware of them,” Levine said. “I think the receptacles will have a positive impact and it’s unfortunate that it won’t be more.”</p>\n<p>But Porté said trash in I.V. has been “steadily declining” over the last two years, and that the new receptacles are a way to continue that trend for the “most littered item in the world.”</p>\n<p>“It feels like the culture in Isla Vista is changing a little bit, and this is another way.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Organizers of UC Santa Barbara’s second Million Student March expect a large turnout Thursday, when they plan to march across campus and show support for four demands, including a $15 minimum wage for all campus workers and free tuition at public colleges and universities.</p>\n<p>This year’s march will respond directly to controversial <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/controversial-trump-markings-surface-around-campus/\" target=\"_blank\">chalk writings</a> on campus in the last two weeks that have shown support for Donald Trump and disparaged immigrants and Muslims.</p>\n<p>“At various locations along the path where chalkings were more specific, we will stop in order to have a speaker from those communities address the crowd, and march participants will write positive messages on chalk walls,” the organizers said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The group had three demands in their November 2015 march at UCSB, which

id=\"caption-attachment-69841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Isla Vista, pictured here during Deltopia 2014, is in the middle of a historic push toward self-governance.</p></div>\n<p>Isla Vista, currently an unincorporated area, is leaping toward self-governance in a historic push that could give residents a say in how the area is run.</p>\n<p>The effort toward self-governance is confusing, however, and this confusion is compounded by an alphabet soup of acronyms: CSD, UUT and MAC, to name a few.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud and Cameron Schunk co-authored the Isla Vista Plan of Service, which is a tentative plan for how the area would be run if the measures are passed by Isla Vista voters in November.</p>\n<p>Residents have been pushing for self-governance for nearly 50 years, as Abboud outlined in a <em>Nexus </em>op-ed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/history-in-the-making-isla-vista/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier in April</a>. To get students and I.V. residents up to speed, the<em> Nexus</em> spoke with Abboud and Schunk and asked them some of the most pressing questions about I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>You can click on a question below or scroll through the full guide.</p>\n<p><strong>1. <a id=\"top\" href=\"#1\">What is a community service district and how is it different than a city?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>2. <a href=\"#2\">What are I.V. residents voting on in November?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>3. <a href=\"#3\">Who will be in charge of the CSD?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>4. <a href=\"#4\">What powers will the CSD have?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>5. <a href=\"#5\">How will the CSD pay for these services?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>6. <a href=\"#6\">What is AB 3?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>7. <a href=\"#7\">Why can’t the county provide these services with the county tax?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>8. <a href=\"#8\">How will the CSD change the average Isla Vistan’s day-to-day life?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>9. <a href=\"#9\">Is the I.V. Plan of Service final?</a><br>\n</strong><strong>10. <a href=\"#10\">Where can I get more information?</a></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong id=\"1\" style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">1. What is a community service district and how is it different than a city?</strong></h2>\n<p>Arguably the most important difference between a community service district (CSD) and a city is that cities can make laws while CSDs cannot.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, co-author of the I.V. Plan, said the size of I.V. and the fact that many residents spend their money outside of the area are also factors.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to afford a city with the tax base I.V. has,” Abboud said. “Our sales tax revenues in I.V. are very low. We really only have Pardall [businesses], and a lot of people spend their money in downtown Santa Barbara and Goleta. It’s hard to have a city because we don’t have a tax base for it.”</p>\n<p>Both cities and CSDs are required to do certain things, but cities have more responsibilities. For example, a city is required by law to provide police and jail services.</p>\n<p>Cameron Schunk, co-author of the I.V. Plan and a field representative for Assemblymember Das Williams, said that Goleta spends half of its annual budget on policing. While Goleta residents are generally more comfortable with law enforcement, Schunk said, I.V. residents may be less willing to spend a substantial amount of money on policing.</p>\n<p>“We could never, ever, ever provide police services at all, and even though we have that authority, we’re not required to do it,” Schunk said. “The city has a lot of things that it not only has the authority to do, but the requirement to do.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"2\">2. What are I.V. residents voting on in November?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Nov. 8, Isla Vistans will vote on three measures. The first two measures require a simple majority, while the third measure requires a two-thirds majority.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A vote on whether or not to establish an Isla Vista CSD.</li>\n<li>A vote selecting five of the directors who will govern the district (see <a href=\"#3\">question 3</a>).</li>\n<li>A vote on whether or not to establish an 8 percent utility users tax (see <a href=\"#4\">question 4</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If passed, all three measures would go into effect on March 1, 2017.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"3\">3. Who will be in charge of the CSD?</strong></h2>\n<p>Seven directors will govern the CSD. When I.V. residents vote in November on whether or not to establish the CSD, they will also elect five members to sit on a new Board of Directors. In addition, one director will be appointed by the county and one director will be appointed by UCSB.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69844\" style=\"width: 245px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69844\" data-attachment-id=\"69844\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-13/10-questions-about-isla-vista-self-governance/jonathan-abboud_by-spencer-brandt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Jonathan Abboud_by Spencer Brandt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69844\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=235%2C156\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"235\" height=\"156\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&amp;ssl=1 980w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jonathan-Abboud_by-Spencer-Brandt.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jonathan Abboud, co-author of the I.V. Plan. <em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“The directors are responsible for everything the CSD does,” Abboud said. “They are responsible for making sure it’s fiscally responsible. They’re the ones who vote on policy and make sure the policy is implemented.”</p>\n<p>These directors would also hire a general manager to oversee the day-to-day activities that keep the district running.</p>\n<p>Four of the five elected directors and both appointed directors would have four-year terms. The other elected director would have a two-year term. There are no term limits for the directors, which Schunk said could work to the Board’s advantage.</p>\n<p>“We are very interested in having long-term representation on that board,” Schunk said. “That is helpful for a lot of districts because if there is a question of how they did something 40 years ago, there’s a guy who can answer that.”</p>\n<p>Candidates for the Board will have to register to run by Aug. 8.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"4\">4. What powers will the CSD have?</strong></h2>\n<p>The I.V. Plan outlines eight powers the CSD is prioritizing:</p>\n<p><strong>• Municipal Advisory Council (MAC):</strong> The MAC would be purely advisory, giving input to the Board of Directors based on feedback from I.V. residents. It is possible that the MAC would include directors from the Board.</p>\n<p><strong>• Area Planning Commission (APC):</strong> The APC would essentially be a zoning board that would “oversee all new development proposals that are submitted within the Isla Vista area,” according to the I.V. Plan.</p>\n<p><strong>• Graffiti abatement:</strong> The I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District is currently in charge of washing away graffiti, but the I.V. Plan says finding funding for this program is a “constant struggle.” The Plan proposes a $10,000 annual budget to keep graffiti abatement up and running.</p>\n<p><strong>• Parking district</strong>: The I.V. Plan proposes funding comprehensive parking studies that will allow the Board of Directors, with the survey data, to establish a parking district specific to I.V.’s needs.</p>\n<p><strong>• Landlord-tenant mediation services:</strong> UCSB students currently have access to tenant mediation services through the UCSB Community Housing Office, but the I.V. Plan proposes a contract between the CSD and the Santa Barbara Rental Housing Mediation Program specifically aimed toward non-UCSB students in I.V., half of which are Hispanic families, according to the Plan.</p>\n<p><strong>• Community policing:</strong> The I.V. Plan proposes a “cadet program” run through I.V. Foot Patrol, employing five cadets that would work part-time, especially during weekend nights when UCSB is in session.</p>\n<p><strong>• Gutter, street tree and sidewalk infrastructure improvement: </strong>A proposed $5,000 would go toward “enhancements to public space” such as trees next to streets, art on sidewalks and benches, according to the I.V. Plan.</p>\n<p><strong>• Maintenance and management of community facilities: </strong>The I.V. Plan proposes hiring a half-time grant writer whose job would be ascertaining funding for the I.V. Community Center at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"5\">5. How will the CSD pay for these services?</strong></h2>\n<p>The simple answer is federal grants, UCSB funding and a tax on I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>When Isla Vistans vote in November, they will vote on whether to enact a utility users tax (UUT), which will tax I.V. residents’ electricity, water, gas and trash services at a rate of 8 percent. If passed, the tax would go into effect on March 1, 2017, when the CSD is officially established.</p>\n<p>Schunk said that, as of now, almost everybody’s services would be taxed equally at 8 percent, although there would be exemptions for low-income residents and families and potentially a difference between residential and commercial properties.</p>\n<p>“My hope is that the Board of Directors do a series of public engagement workshops,” Schunk said, “where they meet with stakeholders from the business community, students, community members and say, ‘Here is your expected burden; is that acceptable? Yes or no.’”</p>\n<p>UCSB has pledged an annual $200,000 to the CSD for seven years, and backers of the CSD also hope to get additional money by applying for federal grants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"6\">6. What is AB 3?</strong></h2>\n<p>Assembly Bill 3, authored by Assemblymember Das Williams and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown on Oct. 7, 2015, gives I.V. the power to do things that no other CSD is allowed to do if it is passed by voters. These services include running a parking district, establishing a tenant mediation program and creating the Area Planning Commission.</p>\n<p>“No other CSD in the entire state of California has ever been able to provide a tenant mediation program. No CSD has ever been able to provide code enforcement,” Schunk said. “When we talk about how unique AB 3 and the CSD is, it goes deeper …  There are so many things here that no other district has.”</p>\n<p>Abboud and Schunk emphasized that, because the I.V. CSD would be the first of its kind to implement several programs, it is vital that passionate people serve on the Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>“There is no precedent for how a CSD runs a tenant mediation program, which is why it’s really important [that the Board includes] people who are critical thinkers who are really looking at the big picture,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"7\">7.

Plan. <em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“People in the City of Santa Barbara chose to form a city and tax themselves for services,” Schunk said. “A similar thing is happening here in Isla Vista. You’re seeing residents saying we want these services this way and we’ll pay for them.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said that, currently, in order for I.V. to get funding for various projects, it needs the support of supervisors who have no attachment to the area.</p>\n<p>“To get funding from the county for things, you need four supervisors to vote in your favor,” Abboud said. “[Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr can be the best supervisor anyone’s been, but if the other supervisors, or even two supervisors, don’t want the funding to go to I.V. for a small service, it won’t happen.”</p>\n<p>“The best thing I.V. voters can do is vote for our supervisor,” Abboud said. “We can’t influence what the other districts are doing.”</p>\n<p>The CSD would change that and give Isla Vistans representatives who would serve the area directly, according to Abboud and Schunk.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p>\n<h2><strong id=\"8\">8.

“unfortunate.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“It’s a sad irony in the fact that [faculty] are creating a marginalized and isolated community, and as opposed to reaching out to them … they were treating the people in the same manner that they were trying to protect the community from,” Morse said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69712\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption

class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">“This is not the ending, this is just the beginning,” Yang said. “We will continue the dialogue, the discussion, the discourse and reaffirm our commitment to having a diverse campus community that fosters an inclusive, respectful and supportive environment.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Some students have already responded to the initial chalking,

A second “Million Student March” is planned for Thursday and organizers have chosen a theme of “reclaiming” UCSB from the anonymous chalk writers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The event description encourages students to join the march “in an effort to RECLAIM our campus after heinous, racist chalk statements targeted at many marginalized communities at UCSB.” The group says it

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo courtesy of YouTube channel The Public</em></p></div>\n<p>Goodman has hosted “Democracy Now!” since 1996, and for most of that time it has run on KCSB-FM, the UCSB radio station that is presenting Goodman’s talk and book signing. Goodman’s book, <em>Democracy Now!: Twenty Years Covering the Movements Changing America</em>, written with contributors David Goodman and Denis Moynihan, will be released on April 12.</p>\n<p>“One of our first stops is Santa Barbara and a fundraiser for KCSB,” Goodman said in a phone interview Tuesday. “I’ll be talking about independent media in a time of war and elections and how important it is to have the media, when we cover war, that’s not brought to you by these weapons manufacturers.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said her new book explores “the idea that it’s movements that make history,” rather than individual politicians.</p>\n<p>“Instead of hearing the same small circle of pundits, who know so little about so much, explaining the world to us and getting it so wrong, you hear people [on “Democracy Now!”] at the grassroots, closest to the story, telling their own stories,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>When the show began, “Democracy Now!” was broadcast on nine community radio stations. Twenty years later, the program is broadcast on more than 1,400 television and radio stations internationally.</p>\n<p>Goodman said she wanted to make college campuses a major part of her 100-city tour because universities and student activism are central to her show’s purpose.</p>\n<p>“We have a young, diverse audience and there’s so much happening on college campuses around the country, so it’s a critical part of what we do,” Goodman said, mentioning the Black Lives Matter movements last year at the University of Missouri, Ithaca College and more. “It is astounding how students’ voices are a key part of these movements.”</p>\n<p>When asked about the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-01/controversial-trump-markings-surface-around-campus/\" target=\"_blank\">recent chalk markings around UCSB</a> supporting Donald Trump and disparaging immigrants and Muslims, Goodman called the slogans “extremely insulting.”</p>\n<p>“What Donald Trump has done is really open Pandora’s box with his hate-filled rhetoric; his islamophobic, sexist, racist language; his outright encouraging violence at his rallies,” Goodman said, adding that the students’ reaction was vital to maintaining a welcoming environment.</p>\n<p>“I think students’ reaction—banding together and saying they won’t tolerate hate on campus—is a very important one and it’s a part of a whole coalescing of student activism,” Goodman said. “I think there’s a lot of energy on campus and a lot of commitment to making change, and that’s critical to the functioning of the democratic society.”</p>\n<p>The Daily Nexus is named after a quotation attributed to educator Robert Maynard Hutchins: “A free press is the nexus of any democracy.”</p>\n<p>Goodman said Hutchins’ words are “absolutely” as true today as they were in 1970 when the <em>Nexus</em> was renamed.</p>\n<p>“I think independent media is the oxygen of a democracy, whether on campuses or off campuses,” Goodman said. “There is a reason why our profession — journalism — is the only one explicitly protected by the U.S. Constitution, because we’re supposed to be the check and balance.”</p>\n<p>Goodman will be speaking at Corwin Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday. The event is free for students and $10 for non-students.

With the new space, Metzger said, they will be able to check into a physical office.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69621\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69621\" data-attachment-id=\"69621\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/ucpd-to-create-new-office-in-library/police-substation_by-jenny-luo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Police Substation_by Jenny Luo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69621 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"Police Substation_by Jenny Luo-1\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Police-Substation_by-Jenny-Luo-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69621\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCPD officers will not work in the substation on a regular schedule, but will be able to stop by and write reports, conduct interviews or store their radios and other equipment. It also allows UCPD to extend their reach across campus.</p>\n<p>“This is just one substation they have as part of that broader goal to break down those barriers in the communities they serve,” Metzger said.</p>\n<p>Olson said the office will also allow the department to extend its reach to the east area of campus. Much of UCPD’s focus is dedicated to the center of campus and the west side, which borders Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>The substation “definitely extends ourselves to that east campus because we don’t have a large presence unless we’re mobile, driving in that area,” Olson said, adding that the new office is “a place where we can literally hang our hat.”</p>\n<p>Heather Vest, fourth-year biology major who was walking out of the library Monday afternoon, said she had mixed feelings about the new substation.<br>\n“I’ve been here late at night and I’ve seen CSOs walking around, but it’s not like a lot of security really,” Vest said. “I feel pretty secure in the library — everything’s closed at night and there’s only one door open — but maybe other people don’t.”</p>\n<p>While Vest said she thought the new substation was a “cool” idea, she said seeing police on campus makes her think someone has committed a crime.</p>\n<p>“I feel like in the past I’ve seen UCPD on campus and it kind of makes people feel uncomfortable,” Vest said. “If someone’s driving around in a UCPD car, I know that something’s going on on campus or something’s wrong.”</p>\n<p>That view is one that Olson hopes will change with the new station. He said officers should be “accessible to the community, a visible presence” and that the new substation will help officers interact casually with students.</p>\n<p>Nicholas O’Dea, first-year physics major, was studying on a bench outside of the library on Monday. He said “knowing that [the new substation] is there makes me feel a bit more comfortable, knowing that there’s a CSO presence.”</p>\n<p>O’Dea said he understood that others might not want UCPD officers to continually patrol the library, but that the office itself adds a level of security.</p>\n<p>“I might feel a little uncomfortable if they had been patrolling around the library, something of that nature,” O’Dea said. “But that fact that there’s a room there, I don’t feel uncomfortable with that. If something happens in the library, I know I can turn to them.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 3 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

Two members will be appointed rather than elected, one from the county Board of Supervisors and one by UCSB’s chancellor.</p>\n<p>While the approval from the commissioners is a key milestone in I.V.’s road to self-governance, the UUT requires a two-thirds majority, meaning that proponents of the CSD will likely have to campaign heavily in I.V. through November to convince residents to vote for the tax.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69632\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69632\" data-attachment-id=\"69632\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/isla-vista-to-vote-on-csd-tax-in-november/lafco-spencerbrandt-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69632 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4-1024x683.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFCO-SpencerBrandt-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69632\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>If passed, the eight-percent UUT would apply to I.V.’s water, gas, electricity and trash services.

id=\"caption-attachment-69457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Joyce Dudley, Santa Barbara’s district attorney, is founder and chair of the Isla Vista Safe Committee. <em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Dudley proposed two ideas Tuesday that would change Isla Vista’s judicial process: A prosecutor who would have an office in Isla Vista and exclusively try crimes committed in I.V., and a neighborhood court that would bring “restorative justice” to the area.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to workshops around campus like the Green Dot bystander intervention program, the report said UCSB </span>also employs a UCPD<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> officer whose purpose is to investigate sexual assaults using a “trauma-informed approach when working with survivors,” funded via a three-year grant from the Federal Office on Violence Against Women.</span></p>\n<p>The report welcomed the decreasing attendance and crime during party weekends such as Halloween and Deltopia, saying a combination of deterrents and on-campus events contributed to the decline.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“While clearly we’ve made a lot of progress, the work’s not done.” – Doreen Farr.</p></blockquote>\n<p>UCSB sends letters to officials of other universities whose students are arrested in I.V. during Deltopia or Halloween weekends, and Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students who are arrested during these party weekends are required to meet with an SBCC dean.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thousands of students attended Fitz and the Tantrums and Snoop Dogg concerts during Halloween weekend last year, which the report says UCSB spent more than $300,000 to host. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grouplove played in UCSB’s Thunderdome on Saturday during Deltopia, drawing an estimated 3,500 students, roughly the same number who attended the unsanctioned festivities in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Most of us agree, to feel that we have confidence in a real culture change and in the improved safety of the community, we would like to see the Halloween and Deltopia events down to the level that they were this past year for a couple more years,” Farr said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69456\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img

we’ve made a lot of progress, the work’s not done,” she continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several people made it clear in the public comment period Tuesday that they did not agree with all aspects of the report.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Alternative events are lauded in the report, and I would like to say it is not necessarily the case that they are supported in the community,” said Andrew Gabriel Pragin, a UCSB alumnus who focuses on issues affecting I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pragin noted that although arrests and citations declined this year, the numbers increased as a percentage of those who attended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Adams, chair of the board and fourth district supervisor, said the people who attended Deltopia 2016 must have been the ones who were causing problems in past years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though you had less people attending, those are the people that were the problem in the first place,” Adams said, adding that those people will not learn to “conduct themselves in an adult fashion” until they “get arrested a few more times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Maybe they’ll learn their lesson at some point, I know I did,” Adams said. “I just think that this number will go down if we keep chipping away at that culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jay Freeman, an Isla Vista resident running for third district supervisor, was very critical of the report, and said I.V. Safe acts as if Isla Vista is “a dangerous infestation” and “a problem to be solved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freeman unfurled large posters of what he said were previous advertising campaigns by I.V. Safe. He said the committee “truly crossed a line” when it ran a picture of inside a medical tent with the caption, “Throwback Thursday to people having a blast at Deltopia last year.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The message of I.V. Safe is one of a totalitarian police state trying to scare people into compliance,” Freeman said, adding that the group’s “rebranding” commercial “comes off as a campaign advertisement for a handful of politicians.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69454\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69454\" data-attachment-id=\"69454\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/isla-vista-crime-down-25-over-two-years-da-reports/board-of-supervisors-meeting-4-5-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Board of Supervisors Meeting 4-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69454\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Board-of-Supervisors-Meeting-4-5_by-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Spencer Brandt / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second District Supervisor Janet Wolf disagreed, saying the advertisement campaign might help others realize that there are consequences to drinking heavily in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pictures of the kids in the tent who were getting medical treatment, it was horrible to me,” Wolf said. “It just kind of struck home to me that this could happen.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board members were very supportive of the campaign, thanking the report’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributors extensively, and were hopeful for what they see as an improved I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First District Supervisor Salud Carbajal said I.V.
