UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa led the discussion, and four other officers attended to answer students’ questions in smaller groups. Deputies from Isla Vista Foot Patrol were initially expected to attend, but did not make an appearance. Questions about the I.V. noise ordinance, parking restrictions and roadblocks and the high number of cops brought in for Deltopia dominated the event.</p>\n<p>Signa opened the event by detailing the parking restrictions on Del Playa and Sabado Tarde, and encouraged students to buy on-campus parking permits and said the event’s purpose was to foster open dialogue.</p>\n<p>“The whole point of tonight is really just an opportunity for me to talk to you about Deltopia and what we are doing there,” Signa said. “It’s also — more importantly — for me to be available to you to answer any questioning.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and UCPD officer Alexis Dougherty said Pizza with Police is good way to educate students on Deltopia and other law enforcement matters.</p>\n<p>“If they have any questions about what’s going to go on this weekend, they can feel free to come up to us and ask openly,” Dougherty said.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Oliveira, a first-year global studies major, said she came to the event to better understand what Deltopia will be like.</p>\n<p>“This is my first year here, so I don’t really know what to expect at Deltopia,” Oliveira said. “I’m hoping this will give me more information on what is going to happen and on how I can make it safe.”</p>\n<p>Shiva Mozaffarian, a fourth-year biology major who had an involved discussion with Signa during the event, said she wrote a list of questions beforehand to ensure she could express her concerns.</p>\n<p>“I wrote them up because I wanted to make sure that I could rationally say all my frustrations about the police department,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian said she attended the event primarily to understand the perspective of police officers on Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that these cops are the police officers that I have problems with, so I just wanted to see if they shared that same issues that we have as the community,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>According to Mozaffarian, some students resist the cops only because they want to party freely, but others, like those who attend events like Pizza with Police, want to offer useful criticism.</p>\n<p>“Some people have problems with the cops because they stop them from partying and drinking, but I think a lot of people are genuinely looking out for the well-being of our community,” Mozaffarian said.</p>\n<p>Many attendees had questions about the special noise ordinance in I.V. for Deltopia weekend. The ordinance states I.V. residents playing music that can be heard from the street can be cited and given a $500 fine. Signa said the ordinance is meant to limit the size of gathering in I.V. residences.</p>\n<p>“As long as the music can’t be heard from outside, it’s no issue, and we’re not looking for that,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Jake Gorham, a third-year political science major, and Duncan Calvert, a third-year political science and history double major, organized the event in their roles as public safety coordinators for the Office of the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA). They started a volunteer force called UCIV Safety Coalition that will consist of 30 volunteers patrolling I.V. during Deltopia handing our water and warning students who may be at risk of citation or arrest.</p>\n<p>Gorham said he hopes that, if the UCIV program is successful, he and Calvert can turn it into a more permanent establishment to contribute to community policing in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We are really trying to advocate for community policing in Isla Vista, and we are hoping the volunteer program brings that out,” Gorham said. “It’s not going to happen overnight, but we are hoping for gradual change.”</p>\n<p>According to Calvert, the volunteer force will mainly focus on preventing noise-related citations and said they will help relay information about parking restrictions, but obeying the law is ultimately the individual student’s responsibility.</p>\n<p>“The volunteer force is hopefully going to mitigate all of the noise ordinance violations,” Calvert said. “We really don’t want students having misdemeanors on their records and having that bad experience.”</p>\n<p>Calvert said he hopes that the volunteer force will show UCPD and the IVFP that there are students actively seeking solutions for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The majority of police officers are dealing with our population at its worst,” Calvert said. “We are trying to create a good dialogue between the student body and officers who care and are committed.”</p>\n<p>Signa also said he supports Gorham and Clavert’s endeavor.</p>\n<p>“It’s better that students talk to students than that the cops talk to them,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa said he hopes arrests will be minimal, but warned that there will be no drunk tank in I.V. and all students will be processed and sent to Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p>“If arrests do happen, we will be very strict as far as if you are drinking and publicly intoxicated,” Signa said. “With all the cops out there, there will be zero tolerance.”</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian however said she thinks the cops focus too much on arresting students for public drunkenness.</p>\n<p>“My biggest concern is that — after everything we’ve undergone — I think it’s been proven that the problems of I.V. are not due to the parties or the drunk students walking around minding their own business,” Mozaffarian said. “The problem is bigger than that.”</p>\n<p>Gorham said he hopes UCIV will help warn students that they are at risk for arrest for public drunkenness before they come in contact with the police.</p>\n<p>“The police have said it’s technically a no-tolerance policy during Detlopia,” Gorham said. “Our goal is to be able to give out warnings and give people a heads up.”</p>\n<p>A central concern among students at the event was the increase of police presence planned for Deltopia, but Signa said this increase is proven to correlate with lower crime rates.</p>\n<p>“The whole idea is we want to saturate the place and just be visible,” Signa said. “They are looking for people who might be causing problems that might be dangerous.”</p>\n<p>Despite this, Signa said he believes the solution to I.V.’s fundamental problems do not lie in increased police presence.</p>\n<p>“As much as the police department and the sheriff’s department put in effort as far as having cops here, bringing in a horse team, and all this extra equipment, that’s only a band aid that doesn’t fix the problem,” Signa said. “The problem has to be fixed from within the community.”</p>\n<p>Mozaffarian said she understands the crime-prevention intention of increased police presence but said she is not convinced of its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>“I don’t really understand why we bring extra law enforcement, but still go after drunk students just sitting on a curb,” Mozaffarian said. “If the cops are here to protect and serve, they shouldn’t be victimizing the students.”</p>\n<p>After the event, Mozaffarian said Signa was clearly being “diplomatic” when he answered her questions and she said she appreciated his effort to work with students.</p>\n<p>“Mark is such an amazing guy,” Mozaffarian said. “He is one of the cops that prove that there are good cops out there with good intentions who are looking out for the best of our community.”</p>\n<p>Signa said he hopes the dialogue between students and police can extend beyond Pizza with Police and special circumstances like Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“We need to represent you,” Signa said. “You need to be able to come to us and ask your questions — not just at Pizza with the Cops.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A CSD is a form of local self-government, in which a given area can levy taxes to pay for certain municipal services through a locally elected board. The primary questions facing the group included the size and makeup of the governance board, how it would be formed and how members would be elected. Attendees split up into small groups and debated the finer points of these and other aspects of a governing board for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Options for governance board selection included discussions on whether or not the CSD governing board would be composed of at-large members, representatives elected by the entire district to represent the entire district, or district members representing certain geographic portions of the CSD and elected by residents of those portions. Other contentious issues involved the ratio of elected-to-appointed members of the board, with significant disagreements regarding the ratio of appointed or elected board members, as well as the boundaries of the would-be CSD.</p>\n<p>Williams began the meeting with a brief introduction on the goals of AB 3 and the public meetings occurring to flesh out the specifics of the bill language. The bill as it stands, according to Williams in a prior interview, should include language that provides powers for a CSD to contract for additional public safety services such as community service officers; a rental housing mediation task force; a municipal advisory council, which would allow the CSD to advise the county on additional policy for I.V.; and an area planning commission. The bill has until mid-March before it enters legislative committees in Sacramento, at which point it can still be modified.</p>\n<p>Groups primarily disagreed on the makeup of the board by numbers, with boards as large as 11 members and as small as five proposed by several of the working groups. A group led by Associated Students Senators third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez and second-year physics major Liam Stanton proposed a six member governing board with three ex officio non-voting members, possibly representing Santa Barbara City College, the university and the I.V. Property Owners Association, a majority of which would be elected by a margin of at least two members.</p>\n<p>“As far as the composition of the board goes, we felt that having the majority of the board be elected was absolutely essential to democratic ideals,” Stanton said. “There should be two more elected members than appointed members at least.”</p>\n<p>Stanton also said SBCC should be ex-officio but not voting because the college does not generate tax revenue for the would-be CSD. Lopez said the CSD board should be apportioned into voting districts with elected members ideally coming from different stakeholder groups in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If possible we would like the districts to be formed around the idea of one district more likely to represent a long term homeowner, one group more likely to represent a long term homeowner, a renter, perhaps a Latino renter, or both, one group more likely to do a student representative … and other two groups to be divided based on the areas that aren’t already in those groups,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and Open People’s Party chair Andre Theus said his group proposed a seven member board of four elected and three appointed representatives and favored an at-large basis for board representation and district boundaries including portions of West Campus and family housing.</p>\n<p>“We don’t think there should be people elected from certain districts, whatever the geographical terms would be,” Theus said. “There’s a lot of talk only including the box or square of Isla Vista; I personally thought we should include … the housing of those students, West Campus and faculty, because a major portion of students in the next 3-5 years will be living and centered near Santa Catalina.”</p>\n<p>One topic of debate at the meeting was the extent to which the university should participate in the CSD. Alumnus Alex Rodriguez, who graduated in December with a degree in political science, said the CSD does not need to include the university at all. Rodriguez said the last time I.V. residents proposed a CSD, the university opted not to participate in the process.</p>\n<p>“My problem is that UCSB has never cared about I.V.,” Rodriguez said. “They just bought up property so they can collect taxes in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Sasha Bates, a first-year history major and OPP candidate for off-campus senator, said although OPP does not take a stance on the CSD as a whole, he does believe the university should be part of the conversation.</p>\n<p>“I thinks it’s completely absurd to say UCSB doesn’t care about Isla Vista,” Bates said. “Isla Vista gets its heart and soul from the student population.”</p>\n<p>Bates said if I.V. does become a CSD, it should include the university as a stakeholder.</p>\n<p>“I think UCSB should have some role,” Bates said. “UCSB is an integral part of the Isla Vista community, be it faculty or students.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said he is personally in favor of involving the university in the CSD. According to him, incorporating the campus would help the CSD financially.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the talks we’ve been having have UCSB being included in our CSD, and that would be a big income,” Lopez said. “In the last few years they have definitely picked up on the amount they are interested in helping the community.”</p>\n<p>But Rodriguez said the university’s tendency to continue “pushing students off campus” has only lead to a housing crisis for I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“UCSB and the property owners got us here in the first place,” Rodriguez said</p>\n<p>Molasses Jones, who lives in the Pescadero Lofts, said she is skeptical about involving the university within the CSD.</p>\n<p>“Adding UCSB to the fold is a bad deal,” Jones said. “They’re going to take over this little area that has opportunities to self-govern and create the environment that it wants to create.”</p>\n<p>Stanton said he favors elections by district divisions, and wants all members to be democratically elected rather than appointed.</p>\n<p>“I’m personally opposed to having any appointed members on the board at all,” Stanton said. “I think one appointee, but if we’re going to have to have one, it should be a student or someone from the administration of UCSB or SBCC.”</p>\n<p>Lopez said the district-based voting has the potential to represent different interests in I.V. and that different groups of residents, such as long-term, home-owning, low-income or student residents, tend to live in different parts of I.V.</p>\n<p>“UCSB students live certain places, SBCC students live certain places, and they have different needs,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Stanton, however, said he thinks there will be appointees on the CSD board due to pressure from the university and property holders or business owners who do not live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s inevitable we’re going to end up with one or two, because that’s the consensus,” Stanton said. “But I don’t like it.”</p>\n<p>Bates said he hopes to see an increase in student involvement with the CSD process than he has seen so far, based on an observation that very few students were present at the meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s always better to have more students involved in the community,” Bates said. “Whenever students turn up I think more can be achieved.”</p>\n<p>Another issue groups discussed at the meeting was how the CSD would represent I.V. property owners. Rodriguez and Stanton both opposed property owner involvement, but Lopez said it is necessary to include in the CSD.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t include them, they could use their money and resources to oppose our efforts,” Lopez said. “If we don’t include them and the CSD does go through, we could pass all the ordinances we want. But if the property owners don’t consent to something on their property, it could really damper what we can actually do.”</p>\n<p>Jones said she does not want companies who own property in I.V. to have control in the CSD.</p>\n<p>“The way Isla Vista has been in the past few years, I don’t think anyone who doesn’t live in I.V. should be involved,” Jones said. “They’re just collecting rent.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, including appointed positions to the CSD from university or property representatives take away from the idea of I.V. “self-governance.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t like the idea of giving control up to other people,” Jones said. “It’s called self-governance for a reason.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61709\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61709\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/town-hall-talks-representation/","id":4754,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[4753,4752,4751],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Form New Campus Party","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"Third-year political science majors Jason Garshfield and Brandon Morse formed a new campus political party last week, the Free Thinking Patriots (FTP), and plan to compete in the upcoming Associated S...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Third-year political science majors Jason Garshfield and Brandon Morse formed a new campus political party last week, the Free Thinking Patriots (FTP), and plan to compete in the upcoming Associated Students elections this coming April.</p>\n<p>Garshfield is considering running for A.S. President and Morse for A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) under the FTP platform, and both will make an official announcement at the Declaration of Candidacy meeting on March 5. The idea for FTP, which will be the first new party formed since 2010, came from a campus club Morse began in Fall 2013 while a student at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC).</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, FTP aims to preserve the freedoms of individual students.</p>\n<p>“We’re about preserving the basic rights of the students, allowing people who are doing their own thing, minding their own business, to live life,” Garshfield said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said a major component of the FTP platform will be trimming down the A.S. budget to focus on essential services, stating that the library is an example of misaligned budgetary priorities.</p>\n<p>“It’s going through this three-year renovation and that’s going to be going on almost until I graduate,” Garshfield said. “Before either using taxpayer dollars or student funds on these grand projects, we should be focusing on preserving the rights of the students, and that’s what we’re about.”</p>\n<p>Morse said A.S. should not impose funds through lock-in fees, especially considering the low election turnout during fee initiative elections. According to him, FTP will instead give students the option to pay for activities and services separately.</p>\n<p>“You’re voting with your dollar at that point,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Official People’s Party (OPP) Chair and fourth-year political science major Elijah Ettenger said in a statement that eliminating lock-in fees is not the solution to increase fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<p>“We feel the solution is instead to have a more strict process for the enactment of new lock-in fees so that only the most critical are approved,” Ettenger said.</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, one of FTP’s main concerns is “police occupation” in Isla Vista, and he criticized OPP for not addressing this alleged issue.</p>\n<p>“We’re very concerned about the police occupation,” Garshfield said. “The fact that our only elected representatives haven’t been dealing with it is something we definitely feel needs to be corrected.”</p>\n<p>Garshfield said while he believes FTP’s goal to address police behavior will be “fairly noncontroversial” among students, the party’s views on how to address the issue may face opposition.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the students are fed up with the police presence,” Garshfield said. “So that at least is something a lot of students will get behind. What I think might be controversial is that we’re willing to choose freedom over safety … There are some people who believe that without the increased police presence, we are not going to be able to maintain order.”</p>\n<p>Morse said A.S. should view police relations through a framework of “community-based solutions.”</p>\n<p>“I think that there are definitely ways that we can self-regulate,” Morse said, “We don’t need this sort of martial law.”</p>\n<p>According to Ettenger however, OPP has already taken steps toward improving community and police relations.</p>\n<p>“In order to achieve this we must first bring everyone to the table,” Ettenger stated. “OPP has already begun this process by organizing programs such as Pizza with Police and Coffee with the Cops.”</p>\n<p>I.V. Foot Patrol Lieutenant Robert Plastino said he agrees that there needs to be increased efforts made to improve police relations with the student community.</p>\n<p>“Positions like a Community Resource Deputy are sorely needed in Isla Vista, yet budget and staffing issues prevent such outreach,” Plastino said in an email.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said the process he underwent to register FTP as an official party was unnecessarily complicated and could potentially discourage other student political participation.</p>\n<p>“There’s also this very complex set of rules and regulations, and I think a lot of it is designed to stop ordinary students from getting involved,” Garshfield said. “That’s something that’s concerning to me and I’d like to see the elections code made … a little simpler for students to get involved with.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science, black studies major and former Democratic Process (DP) party candidate Mohsin Mirza said he agrees the process involves many barriers. According to him, the DP party has not announced any candidates for the upcoming election.</p>\n<p>“The process is difficult, but more than just rules and regulations,” Mirza said. “If you don’t have the money, if you don’t have the time, if you’re a working-class student — it’s very difficult to be in those positions.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair and second-year political science major Fiona Hayman however said starting a political party is a very accessible process for students.</p>\n<p>“Anyone can start their own party if they fill out the necessary form and appoint a party liaison, who will be the point of communication between the party and the Elections Committee,” Hayman said. “I see this as beneficial for the UCSB community, as the accessibility of the processes of forming a party and running for office is essential to the efficacy of democracy.</p>\n<p>Morse said he and Garshfield decided to register a party for this spring’s election in part to ensure there is a party to compete against OPP.</p>\n<p>“It seems like the OPP party is the only one that is running, so we thought that it was important just to have a competition of different ideas,” Morse said.</p>\n<p>Garshfield said he is worried OPP is gaining complete control of the campus’ political conversations.</p>\n<p>“Over time, I’m worried that it will become more and more of a political machine that simply turns out candidates for the sake of winning,” Garshfield said. “Someone needs to challenge the status quo, and we were the ones to stand up and do it.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, multi-sided political party competition is important to represent the variety of student voices that exist on campus.</p>\n<p>“I believe we need to have multiple parties,” Mirza said. “The fact that there’s just two parties I think is a failure, because I think students think in more than two different ways.”</p>\n<p>But Ettenger said OPP is committed to representing each and every student on campus.</p>\n<p>“Every year our party brings together a diversified group of students that provide a consistent influx of new and innovative ideas to best represent all students,” Ettenger said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to Morse, FTP has gathered support and would like to run more candidates in the upcoming A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>“We’ve found some other people who are interested in running with us,” Morse said. “Generally, we have gained a lot of support.”</p>\n<p>Morse said while FTP’s conservative ideas may face challenges, he hopes the party will be seen as a vehicle for representing common student interests.</p>\n<p>“The Free Thinking Patriots is not about representing one party as a whole,” Morse said. “Its specific mandate is to rise above that and come up with common ground solutions.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, the rising cost of education makes collective funding for student groups vital in order to ensure student empowerment and diversity.</p>\n<p>“At a time when education is so expensive, we need well-funded organizations advocating for us,” Mirza said. “The idea of having students pay for things themselves, out of pocket, undermines the idea that we are stronger when we act together and pull all our resources together.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he runs the A.S. Lobby Corps, which uses A.S. funding to take students to Sacramento to meet with California legislators and lobby on student-related issue like affordability of education. Mirza said he thus feels A.S. funding for particular student activities is important.</p>\n<p>“That money is used for very important things that help students,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Mirza also said the A.S. budget could be made more efficient without having to reduce collective student funding.</p>\n<p>“Do I think that we could be doing more with the resources we have? Yes,” Mirza said. “But I think it’s absurd to say the solution is to weaken our own power by taking away our ability to fund ourselves and our projects.”</p>\n<p>According to Morse, although he does not “think that it’s a secret that [he is] a conservative,” he said he hopes FTP will be seen as a vehicle for representing common student interests, not as a platform for his and Garshfield’s politics.</p>\n<p>“The Free Thinking Patriots is not about representing one party as a whole,” Morse said. “Its specific mandate is to rise above that and come up with common ground solutions.”</p>\n<p>While Garshfield called FTP an “underdog,” he said believes in its ideals and is ready to compete with OPP.</p>\n<p>“If I didn’t believe in shooting high I wouldn’t be doing this,” Garshfield said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Pakistan Marc Grossman visited campus this past Friday to speak to students at the global studies department about his 30-year career with the U.S. Foreign Service.</p>\n<p>As a former diplomat and government official, Grossman also worked as the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, which is the State Department’s third ranking official. As Under Secretary, Grossman assembled diplomatic support for the U.S. after the September 11 attacks, and as U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan he supported the Afghan peace process and worked to improve U.S.-Pakistan relations.</p>\n<p>Grossman, who was born in Los Angeles, received a degree in political science from UCSB, and said one of his professors saw his potential after two years at the university.</p>\n<p>“He arranged for me to go on the Education Abroad Program,” Grossman said. “I’d never left the state of California before, and hours later we landed in London.”</p>\n<p>Grossman then got his master’s degree in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science before returning to Santa Barbara. Grossman said after returning and working in Santa Barbara for several years, he sought a career that would cater to his passion.</p>\n<p>“I came back to Santa Barbara, where I worked for three years — a year in politics and a couple years selling things door to door, which turned out to be great experience,” Grossman said. “One day I said to myself, I have got to find a profession that is going to pay me to live abroad and be curious about how other people live.”</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, he passed the Foreign Service exam at UCSB, then the oral exam at the Federal Building in Los Angeles, and in March of 1976 joined the Foreign Service and moved to the East Coast.</p>\n<p>Grossman said one of his biggest accomplishments during his time in the Foreign Service was working to dissuade the Turkish government from using torture when handling prisoners.</p>\n<p>“We were able to convince Turks that this kind of abuse — the systematic abuse of people — was just wrong,” Grossman said.</p>\n<p>According to Grossman, diplomacy is always changing, and he is excited to see college students majoring in fields like global studies and considering international careers.</p>\n<p>“The world is changing so fast, and these interactions are changing so fast,” Grossman said. “I teach to a lot of brand new American diplomats, and I envy them. They are really going to lead our engagement in the world for a very long time to come.”</p>\n<p>Grossman said students today are lucky to have more opportunities in the international field than he had when he started his career.</p>\n<p>“If you wanted to live that kind of life, diplomacy was basically the only way to do it,” Grossman said. “The choices that you all now have with non-governmental organizations, with charities, with multilateral organizations, with businesses, with more ways that people are today employed abroad, are very exciting prospects.”</p>\n<p>Grossman also said he hopes some students will consider a career in diplomacy for the United States.</p>\n<p>“I hope you really will consider representing the United States,” Grossman said. “There’s no substitute for working in an office where you have the American flag flying.”</p>\n<p>Global Studies Professor Eve Darian-Smith said Grossman gave students insight into a career path many global studies students are considering to pursue.</p>\n<p>“The visit from former Ambassador Marc Grossman was very exciting and granted our Global Studies students a glimpse into the life of a leading diplomat working at the frontlines of U.S. foreign policy in extremely difficult political contexts,” Darian-Smith said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and psychology double major Edixon Puglisi said it is important that those who are “experts of their craft” convey their experiences to students.</p>\n<p>“It is very important to pass down to new generations the keys to success in each field of study, as well as the experiences of success and failure in each field, in such a way so that we may learn from our mistakes and become more efficient and effective individuals in society,” Puglisi said.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Harrison Marshall said listening Grossman’s talk actually helped him finalize his decision to apply to work for the U.S.</p>\n<p>“For me personally it gave me a lot of perspective on what I want to be pursuing with my life,” Marshall said. “Because of the visit I’m most definitely going to be applying for the State, which is something I had only considered before.”</p>\n<p>According to Darian-Smith, the Q&amp;A session following Grossman’s talk gave many students insight into the nuances of a career in foreign diplomacy.</p>\n<p>“It was a unique opportunity for students to ask the Ambassador direct questions, which he answered with candor, grace and humor,” Darian-Smith said. “Students’ minds were opened up to the contradictions and unpredictability of navigating foreign relations across different cultures, religions and worldviews, and the visit provided an invaluable ‘real-life’ teaching moment.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into underground rock in order to force it open and extract oil or gas. Mason specializes in Environmental and Resource Economics and is an associate editor of the <em>European Economic Review</em>, co-editor of the <em>Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists</em> and joint editor-in-chief of <em>Strategic Behavior in the Environment.</em></p>\n<p>Mason began his lecture by addressing the economic advantages behind fracking such as increased employment from fracking-related jobs as well as an increase in the supply of natural gas for consumers worldwide.</p>\n<p>“With this kind of expansion in production you have a large increase in supply,” Mason said. “That generally means two things to people who use natural gas — greater ability and lower prices. This is the kind of thing that politicians would naturally glom onto.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, another advantage brought on by fracking includes a decrease in carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>“This big increase in the production of natural gas has lead to a displacement of coal as a source for producing electricity, which in turn means a reduction of carbon emissions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>However, Mason said the potential water contamination caused by hydraulic reinjection is a major concern regarding fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“A particular amount of the angst about fracking, I think, has to do with the potential for groundwater contamination,” Mason said. “The contaminated water that comes from the frack job is the larger consideration.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61006\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61006\" data-attachment-id=\"61006\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-18/prof-discusses-pros-cons-of-fracking/mason-fracking-talk_paris-cullen-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=2567%2C3470&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2567,3470\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424178408\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"36\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mason Fracking Talk\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=758%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61006\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2-758x1024.jpg?resize=350%2C473\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=758%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 758w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=185%2C250&amp;ssl=1 185w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mason-Fracking-Talk_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-61006\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to Mason, research on the exact environmental costs of fracking has been hindered by the incomplete record keeping on the part of natural gas companies.</p>\n<p>“Until relatively recently, there was considerable lack of transparency about what was being done,” Mason said. “We don’t know what’s in the chemical compounds that are being used as part of the frack job, we don’t know how dangerous it is … we don’t know whether or not we should worry about this getting into our groundwater.”</p>\n<p>Mason also said his research on water contamination, which is his focus regarding his studies on fracking in Sublette County, Wyoming, has shown him the extent of companies’ inadequacy in reporting fracking practices.</p>\n<p>“There’s asymmetric information,” Mason said. “The firms that are undertaking these jobs know exactly what they’re injecting, but we know nothing.”</p>\n<p>According to Mason, he uses company reports to research the consequences of fracking, and his findings have shown that some potentially toxic ingredients of the fracking process are left out as “trade secrets.”</p>\n<p>“They do have specific information of the ingredients that were used, subject to trade secrets exceptions,” Mason said.</p>\n<p>First-year student in the Bren School master’s program Leah Fine said Mason’s lecture reinforced material she has learned in her environmental policy classes.</p>\n<p>“Especially since being at Bren, I’ve become more interested in the production of groundwater resources,” Fine said. “It was a cool tie-in with some of the curriculum here at the Bren School, and I thought it was really interesting to hear how different companies disclose information.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year student in the Bren School master’s program Hye Min Park, it was useful to hear about the practical applications of fracking outside of the classroom.</p>\n<p>“This is a really specific issue that I don’t always get to learn about in lectures,” Park said, “I thought it was really interesting to see how it is applied in the real world.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

said the shooting is a manifestation of recent Islamophobic sentiments in the U.S.</p>\n<p>“This comes at a time when Islamophobia had become all too clear in the way conversations are held and how the media reports the news,” Jishi said.</p>\n<p>According to Jishi, the incident highlights discriminatory treatment of Muslims purported by some mass media outlets.</p>\n<p>“A Muslim-American Human Rights lawyer was asked on CNN whether he supported ISIS,” Jishi said. “This creates an atmosphere where hatred towards Muslims can become prevalent for no other reason than the God they worship or the attire they choose.”</p>\n<p>Jishi also said the MSA views the three students “as our brothers and sisters in faith,” and that the candlelight vigil aimed to bring attention to the Islamophobic sentiment that pervades even college campuses.</p>\n<p>Whitney Triplett, a third-year psychology major who attended the event, said the vigil helped create a space in which students could be informed about what happened in Chapel Hill as well as be supportive of the victim’s families.</p>\n<p>“It’s important for these types of stories to get out and be made public,” Triplett said. “It’s important to come out and make a statement and let these peoples’ families know that even from here in California we mourn with them.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biochemistry major Yasmin Sallak said students living in Isla Vista last Spring can relate the incident at Chapel Hill.</p>\n<p>“Here at UCSB we know what it’s like to lose students,” Sallak said.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman from Santa Barbara Hillel was present at the vigil and said he attended in order to mourn with a fellow religious community on campus.</p>\n<p>“I’m very sensitive to both the trauma of these kind of horrible murders at a college campus,” Goodman said. “Especially when it involves a religious community.”</p>\n<p>According to Goodman, solidarity among religious communities is especially vital in the midst of instances of hate crime.</p>\n<p>“If there was even a hint of this being a bias or hate crime then we need to stand together,” Goodman said.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_60874\" style=\"width: 610px\"

Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents California’s 19th district including Santa Barbara, introduced Senate Bill 186 on Monday, which would authorize California community colleges to discipline students with suspension or expulsion for off-campus conduct.</p>\n<p>The bill would allow individual community colleges to develop criteria for when to exercise their new authority and would enable them to discipline students alongside the law enforcement for sexual assault, physical abuse, threats of violence, arson-related offenses, sexual harassment, stalking and hazing. SB 186 amends Section 76034 of the California Education Code, which currently states that on community college campuses, “No student shall be removed, suspended, or expelled unless the conduct for which the student is disciplined is related to college activity or college attendance.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said her bill is a response to concerns voiced by community college students and representatives, who she continuously consulted while writing SB 186.</p>\n<p>“In doing this bill, I was listening carefully to concerns that were expressed by, particularly, our own community colleges both in Santa Barbara and in the other parts of the district, which were very concerned about the limited scope of their ability to discipline,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>SBCC President Lori Gaskin said the bill would provide an important resource for the college to police its student body.</p>\n<p>“Senator Jackson and I have talked about areas that provide options for California community colleges to ensure the standards of student conduct are understood and honored,” Gaskin said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the bill would hold Isla Vista residents who attend SBCC to the same behavioral standards already enforced on UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We have students who live in Isla Vista who are given a pass for behavior that subjects our university students to some kind of disciplinary action,” Jackson said. “There’s really no excuse in my opinion for allowing a pass to someone for this kind of egregious behavior while other students are subject to discipline.”</p>\n<p>However, Gaskin also said while she is glad Jackson authored the bill, it is “bittersweet” that the legislation is necessary to maintain student discipline and that there are better ways to encourage good behavior.</p>\n<p>“I don’t like engaging my students in a negative way,” Gaskin said. “I like engaging them in a positive way — making them aware of our expectation that they’re scholars first and foremost and that they are pursuing this gift of higher education.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lieutenant Robert Plastino said SB 186 would help law enforcement maintain safety in areas surrounding campuses by including community colleges in that process.</p>\n<p>“I believe that extended jurisdiction can have positive outcomes when it is used appropriately,” Plastino said. “I believe that the bill is a good start to empowering community colleges in their efforts to keep their students and neighboring communities safe.”</p>\n<p>Second-year SBCC undeclared major Daniela Hunt said she agrees with the general idea behind the bill, but expressed concerns about its potential for overreaches of authority.</p>\n<p>“If the student was in trouble for something drinking-related, it should not be the school’s concern and the student has a right to privacy,” Hunt said.</p>\n<p>Second-year SBCC engineering major Colin Andrews said he agrees with the idea of holding college students living in the same community to the same standard, even if they attend different schools.</p>\n<p>“I think the bill is good in that it will hold SBCC student[s] living in Isla Vista accountable to their school in the same way as their neighboring UCSB students,” Andrews said. “I just hope that authority would really only be used for serious crimes with victims.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said she recognizes the need for discipline but hopes students take the time to consider the consequences of their actions before the disciplinary process becomes necessary.</p>\n<p>“I like to ensure students recognize — from the get-go as freshman — that this is an important time of life,” Gaskin said. “There are reasonable expectations and standards of conduct that a reasonable person is expected to abide by in a college setting.”</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Students Debbie Fleming said it would be good for SBCC and UCSB students living in I.V. to have consistent rules.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista, where we have both UC and SBCC students living and socializing together, this new bill will help to create more consistent accountability and level the expectations and consequences for student residents,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>According to Fleming, the university strictly adheres to a code of conduct that is very similar to what SBCC would likely adopt similar policies if SB 186 is passed.</p>\n<p>“Our code of conduct allows us to exercise off-campus jurisdiction over physical abuse, sexual assault and sexual harassment, threats of violence or other conduct that threatens the health or safety of any persons,” Fleming said. “When serious and concerning behavior is brought to our attention, either by community members or law enforcement, we will investigate and pursue a conduct case that could be forwarded to the appropriate Conduct Committee for a hearing.”</p>\n<p>Jackson, who co-authored California’s recent “Yes Means Yes” bill with Senator Kevin de Leon, said this bill is part of her long-standing commitment to addressing sexual assault on college campuses.</p>\n<p>“It identifies certain behaviors that are deemed to be egregious, and sexual assault is one of them,” Jackson said. “I have talked to some women’s groups who have also been supportive of the concept.”</p>\n<p>Hunt said she thinks SB 186 would increase accountability for perpetrators of sexual assault, creating a sense of security for students.</p>\n<p>“If the school is notified of those students it will definitely add a layer of protection because the community will feel safer knowing that the perpetrator is punished or under investigation,” Hunt said. “The school should investigate in that case and make sure that the student is guilty, and if so the school should be notified and take necessary actions.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

politics and economics, held its opening ceremony Monday in McCune Hall.</p>\n<p>The Confucius Institute, one of about 400 installments located around the world, will operate out of HSSB 2220 in partnership with Shandong University in China. Representatives from the university, Shandong University, the City of Santa Barbara and the Consulate General of the Peoples Republic of China in Los Angeles were all present at the ceremony. The Institute is funded by the Office of Hanban, located in Beijing, China, with UCSB matching funds.</p>\n<p>Religious Studies professor and Cultural Studies Director of the Confucius Institute Mayfair Yang said she began the process of starting the Confucius Institute in 2010.</p>\n<p>“We are very happy to see that everything is finally in place,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Yang said the Confucius Institute would aid graduate students and faculty whose research involves Chinese Studies.</p>\n<p>“Our Confucius Institute will place a special emphasis not only on language teaching, but on research,” Yang said. “We will put a lot of the Confucius Institute’s energies and funds into promoting China Studies on this campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, more than half of the university’s international students come from China, and the new Confucius Institute will facilitate interaction between Chinese and American students.</p>\n<p>“We also hope to increase the synergy between International Students Studying at UCSB and our own students who have an interest in China,” Yang said. “We will try to hold social activities and scholarly lectures where we bring these two constituencies together.”</p>\n<p>Yang said collaboration between countries like China and the United States is necessary in order to take on global issues such as climate change, terrorism and economic inequality.</p>\n<p>“We have so many global problems that no country can solve,” said Yang. “We all have to come together and deal with our differences — graciously, politely, but persistently — and at the same time try to make stronger bridges so that we can understand each other better and ultimately work together to address these global issues.”</p>\n<p>Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in Los Angeles Jian Liu said the Confucius Institute will teach students Chinese languages in order to facilitate communication between China and the U.S.</p>\n<p>“Language is a bridge connecting different countries and peoples,” Liu said. “Confucius Institute has become this for promoting the beautiful Chinese language.”</p>\n<p>Yang also spoke at the ceremony and said the Confucius Institute illustrates the university’s dedication to a global education.</p>\n<p>“Today as we watch the Confucius Institute on campus, we are creating another opportunity for UC Santa Barbara to facilitate cultural exchange, expand our commitment to global education, and extend new learning and research options to our students,” Yang said. “We feel very, very honored to be able to sign this agreement with Shandong University.”</p>\n<p>Chairman of the University Council for Shandong University Shouxin Li said the Confucius Institute on campus is distinct from others in the U.S. due to its academic collaboration with Shandong University in China.</p>\n<p>“Although there are many Confucius Institutes located around the United States, I can assure you that the University of California, Santa Barbara Confucius Institute is unique because it is established through the cooperation between UCSB and Shandong University — a University near the hometown of Confucius,” Li said.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall said he takes pride in the university’s strengths “in Chinese Language, history, living art, culture and society.”</p>\n<p>“We really hope in partnership with Hanban and our distinguished colleagues at Shandong University to build on these strengths and advance study, education and research in these areas for many years to come,” Marshall said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mayor pro tempore Gregg Hart said Santa Barbara has honored its Spanish history and is happy to see that it is now focusing on the knowledge of Chinese history.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to say that we’ve come to a place where we’re going to respect both historical traditions,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Third-year physics major Matt Share, who is in his second year of studying Chinese, said he hopes the Confucius Institute will mean more Chinese language classes will be offered at the university.</p>\n<p>“Right now, the intro Chinese language courses are offered in a one-year sequence, so if you want to take Chinese and you’re at a certain level, but you miss that course because of a course conflict, you have to wait a whole year,” said Share.</p>\n<p>Second-year Chinese international student majoring in economics Xiaoke Ma performed at the ceremony on a Hulusi, a traditional instrument of the Yunnan province in southern China. She said the Confucius Institute would give her the opportunity to share her culture the campus community.</p>\n<p>“I could let my foreign friends know what the Confucius Institute is and I could show them some of my music, like what I did today,” Ma said. “The way I speak, the way I think — it’s really different from what you guys [American students] think.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice Dean of the Advanced Institute of Confucian Studies at Shandong University and editor-in-chief of China’s <em>Journal of Literature, History and Philosophy</em>, Professor Xuedian Wang said the institute is representative of “a great opportunity to make a commitment” to cultural enrichment.</p>\n<p>“I believe there is huge potential for our inter-cooperation,” Wang said, “So let’s work together.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60446\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60446\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-03/ucsb-hosts-distinguished-guests-for-opening-of-confucius-institute/","id":2903,"author":{"id":130,"name":"Beth Lebens"},"related":[2902,2901,2900],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVTU Holds Campaign For Evicted I.V.

According to former tenant Maria Hernandez, she was not notified of the eviction until two days before the deadline. <em>Anna Kodelashvili/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) hosted a housing forum titled “Tenants Reclaiming Isla Vista” at the Pardall Center in I.V. yesterday in order to gather attention and support for households evicted from their homes at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>The forum was the first event in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/\">a three-day campaign</a> to fight for relocation benefits of six long-term, low income residents who were evicted without justification from their apartments at Abrego Villas on Abrego Rd. in late August 2014. The forum included a presentation from IVTU representatives and a Q&amp;A session with the evicted tenants.</p>\n<p>According to Santa Barbara County Ordinance No. 4444, if five or more residencies are evicted from a property within 90 days, the management company is required to provide financial support in the form of “relocation benefits.”</p>\n<p>Following their evictions, the apartments were allegedly renovated and the rent price increased by 50 percent. The tenants then contacted IVTU and an Associated Students Legal Resource Center and IVTU sponsored lawyer who then informed the tenants of the Ordinance 4444 violation potentially made by property owner Majestic Asset Management, LLC, entitling them to benefits under county law. When the tenants presented their case to Majestic, the property managers refused to grant them benefits and the tenants then challenged the landowner over the amount in small claims court, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors. In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day. – IVTU adviser and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones</p></blockquote>\n<p>Subsequent evictions have taken place over 90 days after the initial six evictions, which IVTU believe is part of an effort to avoid further requests for relocation benefits.</p>\n<p>Brian Lezak of Majestic Asset Management, LLC said the company is not directly responsible for the evictions, and that the property owner did not break any rules.</p>\n<p>“Majestic Asset Management, Inc. is not the owner of Abrego Villas, only the management company,” Lezak said. “The ownership complied with the rules and regulations as outlined in Ordinance 4444 and therefore did not violate any laws.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said the facts have not been plainly presented, and that Majestic is prepared to defend the owner of Abrego Villas.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, the facts that have been publicized have been significantly distorted and are not an accurate reflection of each individual’s situation, and we intend to discuss these facts openly when given the opportunity to do so in the proper forum,” Lezak said. “We will defend their position in court, which is the proper place and one which will ensure that both sides are given an opportunity to present all of the facts.”</p>\n<p>Lezak said Majestic supports IVTU’s purpose, but maintains the company did not violate any regulations.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the Isla Vista Tenants Union, and support them in their desire to defend the claims of those tenant’s in Isla Vista whose situation is in direct violation of this ordinance,” Lezak said. “In the meantime, we are hopeful that any future activities taken by the Isla Vista Tenants Union are done in a peaceful and safe manner.”</p>\n<p>IVTU advisor and Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said the event represents an “opportunity for truly engaged community dialogue” on issues relevant to students and I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“Tonight, we’re going to have an opportunity to hear from some of our neighbors,” said Jones. “In hopes that, in the sharing of stories, we collectively can come away from this with a little bit greater understanding of what’s going on in the lives of the people that we see every day.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, while there are laws in place to protect renters, the law does not require property owners to provide any justification for evictions.</p>\n<p>“The laws do not protect folks from just being evicted,” said Jones. “The property owners have a right, if you will, to evict without any just cause.”</p>\n<p>Third-year economics major and IVTU president Andrey Bogdanov said issues affecting some I.V. residents should be minded by every student who lives in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We believe that fair housing opportunities are for all, and all residents of Isla Vista should unite together to fight for this,” Bogdanov said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60267\" style=\"width: 610px\"

case will go to small claims court, where the tenants will ask that a superior court judge hear the case in order to bring more attention to their allegedly unjustified evictions.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista Tenants Union has sponsored and proved the tenants with a very qualified lawyer who has decided to take on their case,” Bogdanov said. “They have not broken any clauses in their lease in order to be served that eviction notice.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said in a series of <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/tenants-removed-from-isla-vista-apartment-building-in-mass-eviction/\">2013 evictions from 781 Embaradero Del Norte</a>, the tenants were served eviction documents in English, which they were then pressured to sign, despite some tenants’ inability to understand English.</p>\n<p>“Some of the tenants were tricked into waiving their rights,” Bogdanov said. “Some of the tenants were only Spanish speaking and some of the landlords tricked them into signing waivers of their rights which were in English.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said the tenants most recently evicted in October were not offered any justification for their evictions.</p>\n<p>“The tenants were

id=\"caption-attachment-60180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Courtesy of WorldCulture.org</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Senior Associate Dean of Enrollment and Student Academic Programs and Wellness Services Mary Jacob will begin serving as acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs on Feb. 2 following former Vice Chancellor Michael Young’s retirement, in which Young will be leaving behind his 25-year career as Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>Jacob’s career with the Division of Student Affairs began in 1996, where she has began as Director of the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) and then later became the Senior Associate Dean and Executive Director of Student Academic Support Services. During her recently previously held position as Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services, she oversaw admissions, registrar, financial aid and early academic outreach.</p>\n<p>During Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s campus announcement on Jacob’s appointment last week, Yang said Jacob is well versed in the nuances and challenges of working within education and has received numerous campus recognitions during her career.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate Dr. Jacob’s longstanding dedication to our campus and especially our students,” Yang said. “Dr. Jacob has been deeply engaged in education-related activities at the national and international levels as well. She has been recognized with a UCSB Staff Citation for Excellence Award, and a Margaret T. Getman Service to Students Award.”</p>\n<p>OISS Director Simran Singh said he has worked with Jacob since 2002 and that her past work with the university has demonstrated that she is an excellent administrator.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen her in action,” Singh said. “She’s … able to keep many different sets of needs in mind as she makes decisions.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position. – Former Vice Chancellor Michael Young</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob said her time with OISS introduced her to a broad range of operations on campus that have prepared her to assume the duties involved with leading the Student Affairs Division.</p>\n<p>“During that time I got to understand how the Graduate Division operates and how Student Affairs operates, so that gave me a very broad training,” said Jacob.</p>\n<p>Jacob also said her time with the Student Academic Support Services and Enrollment Services gave her the necessary skillset and experience she will need to take on the position.</p>\n<p>“I got greater in-depth experience within the division and on budget processes … through my work as the Executive Director and Associate Dean for Student Academic Support Services and in my current role as the Senior Associate Dean for Enrollment Services,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young, who first met Jacob when she was a candidate for the position of Director of the OISS 19 years ago, said her career thus far at the university makes her an ideal fit for the position.</p>\n<p>“She’s had departmental experience as the department head, she’s had responsibility as a patrol point, she’s a senior administrator in the leadership of the Division and has been so for a number of years,” Young said. “I think she is an ideal choice for the interim position.”</p>\n<p>While her work with Young has helped prepare her to receive the chancellor’s offer to serve as Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Jacob said she was still surprised when she got the call to take on Young’s position.</p>\n<p>“[Young] has an executive group that works with him, and I’ve been a part of that group for a number of years, so I knew that he felt I was prepared if I was asked to be in this position on an interim basis,” Jacob said. “I was prepared if I were asked, but on another level I was surprised when I got a call from the chancellor.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students. – Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mary Jacob</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jacob also said Young has been an extraordinary leader and will be a hard act to follow.</p>\n<p>“He’s leaving enormous shoes behind to fill, and I’m going to do my best to fill them as much as I can in the time that I’m in the position,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>According to Jacob, she will continue to promote the “inclusive” campus climate and support services available to students during Young’s career.</p>\n<p>“I want to maintain the vision that Michael has had — that we have an inclusive community that is supportive and challenging for our students in productive ways – and to provide the best possible services and programs to our students,” Jacob said.</p>\n<p>Young said he trusts Jacob to take on his role, but will be available with his expertise if she needs it.</p>\n<p>“I’ve told her that I won’t be around to interfere or meddle in her affairs, but I’m a phone call way or an email away for a point of view or more likely information — some detail that would be helpful to her,” Young said.</p>\n<p>According to Young, the campus community has a good future ahead of it with Jacob as its Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>“I’m prepared to be helpful in any way that she needs, but I can tell you that the campus — particularly the staff in Division of Students Affairs and the students that we serve through our programs and our initiatives — are well served with Mary Jacob as the Acting Vice Chancellor.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

During the march, over 100 demonstrators walked from Little Acorn Park to Del Playa, then proceeded to walk up and down Del Playa chanting “End rape culture!” and “Consent is an enthusiastic yes!”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think most women who live in Isla Vista can relate to the discomfort and unease that can occur from any kind of sexual harassment. – Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Audrey Westerlund said Bhavnani, who is also Chair of the Academic Senate, prompted her students to organize an event that addressed what they felt were the most prevalent issues in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Immediately, rape culture surfaced as the biggest issue for all of us. Professor Bhavnani prompted us a little and we decided to do something about it,” said Westerlund. “The rest is history.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year anthropology and psychology double major Alexandra Ballinger, event participants felt that Friday’s demonstration was vital in order to bring attention to what many students see as an increase of sexual violence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It was rewarding to be able to say publicly that there are actually people who care about this problem [and] so many people who know it’s unacceptable,” Ballinger said. “In a community where rape happens all the time, we don’t get a chances to say that enough.”</p>\n<p>Westerlund said the event helped shed light on issues regarding safety for women in I.V. and that turnout exceeded organizers’ expectations by amassing twice predicted amount of attendees.</p>\n<p>“I think most women who live in Isla Vista can relate to the discomfort and unease that can occur from any kind of sexual harassment,” Westerlund said. “The fact that this happens in Isla Vista makes this event really relevant to our community.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59842\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59842\" data-attachment-id=\"59842\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end “rape culture.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-59842 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5-1024x681.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-5.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>Participants walked the one-mile stretch while holding posters and passing out flyers that read “No excuse for rape.

We wanted to bring the problem to light in its own arena.”</p>\n<p>During the demonstration, many students and I.V. residents cheered and clapped from their Del Playa balconies, high-fived participants or took videos of the passing crowd.</p>\n<p>Organizers invited students to participate in the demonstration via Facebook in order to facilitate discussion on rape culture in I.V., third-year sociology major and event coordinator Zoe Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<p>“This is an interactive event to help make known that there does exist in Isla Vista a rape culture and this we hope will provide a space where students can comfortably confront rape culture,” Monty-Montalvo said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.]. To end the, ‘Well what was she wearing?’ and ‘Was she drunk?’ questions, and to end the society that makes these questions okay. – Third-year global studies major Claire Breen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Third-year biology major Patrice Trowbridge said gender roles in I.V. play a large part in shaping the presence of rape culture in I.V.</p>\n<p>“To me rape culture is every person that feels entitled to sex and every person that feels obligated to give it. And that’s so pervasive in I.V. The way we look at gender leads to rape but people don’t see that,” Trowbridge said. “Hopefully if we make it hard to ignore it will start some conversations.”</p>\n<p>According to Jonathan Gonzalez, a fourth-year political science major and Vice President of Sigma Lambda Beta fraternity’s local chapter, rape is just as much a male issue as it is a female issue and should be addressed equally by both sexes.</p>\n<p>“Instead of teaching girls to be careful and to watch their backs, we should be teaching the boys to not rape. Our current generation is the next generation of parents so it’s up to us to get educated and educate our boys and girls,” said Gonzalez. “Boys and girls were stopping their normal weekend partying to cheer and chant with us.”</p>\n<p>Alumnus and Nu Alpha Kappa fraternity member Carlos Maldonado said rape culture is a topic that needs to be given immediate attention, especially within organizations that face controversy regarding sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“As a fraternity member, it is essential to be present at these important events so that we may raise awareness and establish accountability within our own organizations so that we do not perpetuate this culture,” said Maldonado.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59843\" style=\"width: 263px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59843\" data-attachment-id=\"59843\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-20/march-decries-rape-culture-in-isla-vista/lorenzo-basiliodaily-nexus-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=4256%2C2832&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4256,2832\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end \\\"rape culture.\\\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421503699\",\"copyright\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Students and locals marched down Del Playa Drive to end “rape culture.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-59843\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4-1024x681.jpg?resize=253%2C168\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"253\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rape-Culture-March_Lorenzo-Basilio-4.jpg?w=2664 2664w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-59843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><i>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</i></p></div>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major Claire Breen, event attendees marched in order to empower others to participate in the local and nationwide movement toward ending rape culture.</p>\n<p>“I think that rape culture is horrifically prevalent not only in Isla Vista, but on all college campuses in the United States,” said Breen. “I was marching to end the cat-calling that occurs [in I.V.].
