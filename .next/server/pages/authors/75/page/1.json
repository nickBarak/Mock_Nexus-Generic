The remaining applications were then scrutinized, with interviews of the applicants being conducted throughout winter and spring quarters.</p>\n<p>“We then passed all that info to the CEOs and co-founders of this company called Social Native. My brother is one of the CEOs and his partner was a judge at the USC chapter’s TAMID Tank, so we felt they could help us with this and they went ahead and chose the three for us. Obviously no names of the applicants were involved to bias the process,” Shadpour said.</p>\n<p>The three finalists included Garpie, an on-foot navigation service that allows users to easily and privately locate and meet with up with their friends in real time; Nectir, an education app that better facilitates classroom participation and study groups; and Crypto For Charity, a service that allows for direct donations of digital currencies to charities.</p>\n<p>At the end of the event, the three judges chose Garpie as the winner of the competition.</p>\n<p>“When we won, it kind of showed that it wasn’t just us thinking that this was a good idea, but also that the public really does like it as well,” said Isaac Golberg, a third-year financial mathematics and statistics major and the vice president of strategic development of Garpie.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83207\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83207\" data-attachment-id=\"83207\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-21/on-foot-navigation-app-wins-new-venture-competition/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83207\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/33139001_10217045154900482_3733345827502948352_n.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83207\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The three judges chose Garpie as the winner of the competition. <em>Courtesy of Mordi Shadpour</em></p></div>\n<p>Golberg said that the win meant a lot to him, as he and the team behind the project put their “blood, sweat, and tears” into Garpie and have “become really one with the product.”</p>\n<p>“The feedback I got from after the event from people was just incredible. Having people come up to me and say things like, ‘This is exactly what I need,’ and, ‘I need this now,’ was incredible to hear,” Golberg said.</p>\n<p>Golberg said what he believed sold the judges on Garpie was the increased accuracy of the geolocation services that the application has, which allows users to precisely locate their friends even in large crowds or huge spaces.</p>\n<p>“Garpie is significantly more accurate than anything on the market right now,” Golberg said. “When you’re using Google Maps or any other big navigation service, they can have up to a 50-foot discrepancy. When it comes to Garpie, it has about a two-to-five-foot accuracy.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golberg said this increased accuracy also allows for the usage of an augmented reality feature within the app.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With Garpie, the augmented reality comes into play with the camera view,” Golberg said. “When you see your friend on a map and you try to go to them, once you start getting close to their location, you can turn on your camera view, as if you were taking a picture, and a virtual marker is displayed above the person’s head. This virtual marker can be an emoji or any virtual content that you want.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you’re in a crowded space like a music festival, that 50 foot discrepancy I mentioned earlier in other services doesn’t help you locate your friend with the virtual marker at all. You need that marker right above your friend’s head,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p>Golberg plans on using the $2,300 cash prize money on travel expenses incurred when meeting with investors in order to raise the seed money needed to get Garpie out into the market by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to accomplish something that nobody else has been able to do,” Golberg said. “The fact is that these major companies, like Apple, Google and Snapchat, would love to optimize their geolocation services … and they have the vast resources to do it, but they haven’t been able to figure out how to do it. So the fact that we have been able to get around this obstacle shows the appeal behind the product.”</p>\n<p>Golberg said that the app is currently in alpha testing while further refinements are made to Garpie, but said that beta testing will soon commence.</p>\n<p>“There will definitely be people on campus testing it,” Golberg said. “After [the beta] cycle we’ll move into our full launch.”</p>\n<p>Shadpour was pleased with the initial response and ultimate turnout to the event. He said several professional groups he approached were enthusiastic about TAMID and sent many of their members to the event.</p>\n<p>“I thought there would be about 330 people who would come, so we only put 330 seats out … There were a lot of people standing in the back. It looked like ultimately there was about 400 people who came throughout the night,” Shadpour said.</p>\n<p>Shadpour said that the event went “amazing” and the highlight of the night for him was just seeing all the people in the back “supporting the students and coming to check out TAMID.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

sandwiches and tater tots. Founder Dave Danhi hopes to host community events at the new store. <em>Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The store will offer a wide variety of grilled cheese sandwiches and tater tots.</p>\n<p>Founder and Chief Creative Officer Dave Danhi said that he has wanted to open up a physical location for some time and that the location in I.V. “kind of fell onto our lap.”</p>\n<p>“The [I.V.] location came to us through a friend, who actually now has become our partner because he was so happy with the concept,” Danhi said.</p>\n<p>“The prior owners of the place just didn’t do well and wanted out, so they left and it became available. When I came up and looked at it, I automatically saw ourselves there,” he added.</p>\n<p>The Grilled Cheese Truck began serving Los Angeles in 2009 in a single truck. The business has since expanded to include three trucks that serve customers from Santa Barbara to Long Beach.</p>\n<p>Following the opening of the I.V. location, Danhi plans to expand truck services to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and open a second physical location in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Danhi also hopes to sell franchises in the distant future.</p>\n<p>Despite the location itself having been previously occupied by short-lived tenants such as a Korean BBQ restaurant and a burrito place, Danhi said that the universality of grilled cheese will attract customers to the store.</p>\n<p>“Grilled cheese is something that I feel everybody has a connection to, usually from their childhoods,” he said. “It’s the epitome of comfort food … so it always brings back good memories.”</p>\n<p>Danhi also noted the enthusiastic responses in I.V. he has received so far as a reason to believe in the store’s success.</p>\n<p>“As we’re setting up the location, we have people stopping by every half-hour asking if they can order already,” Danhi said.</p>\n<p>He plans on getting the community involved in various ways, such as holding a variety of contests and special events.</p>\n<p>“We had our first training session recently, and some of the kids had some great ideas for special nights that we might do, like Pajama Night or Greek Night,” Danhi said.</p>\n<p>Other proposed ideas Danhi mentioned include featuring a sandwich made by a customer as a special on the menu and naming the sandwich after them.</p>\n<p>He also wants to hold fundraisers and raise awareness for different causes for the clubs and organizations of UCSB.</p>\n<p>The new store will be located at 956 Embarcadero del Norte.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of

Wang</em></p></div>\n<p>Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice came to speak at the Arlington Theatre last Thursday, discussing domestic politics, Donald Trump and modern rights movements.</p>\n<p>Rice is a controversial figure due to her role in the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq while working under the Bush administration. Critics accuse her of advocating for the war, despite doubts about the credibility of the intelligence regarding the building of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein.</p>\n<p>This dissension caused the debut of a protest group called the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective.<br>\nMembers of the newly formed organization greeted attendees with chants such as “Lock her up” and “Arrest the war criminal.”</p>\n<p>While Rice avoided the topic of the demonstrators, she made an effort to justify her decisions in the 2003 invasion.</p>\n<p>Rice explained that Iraq was difficult to predict. As the National Security Advisor at the time, she believed that data concluded that Saddam Hussein was working toward weapons of mass destruction.<br>\nThough the invasion showed this presumption was incorrect, Rice felt she had reacted appropriately under the precarious circumstances.</p>\n<p>Despite this argument, demonstrators continued to voice their disapproval.</p>\n<p>“I’m upset that they’re bringing in Condi Rice to speak at UCSB as if she was a legitimate authority on anything,” Howard Winant, UCSB professor of sociology, said. “She used her academic credentials to manipulate and murder and torture and commit war crimes.”</p>\n<p>Cara Yoshizumi, one of the founders of the Santa Barbara Anti War Collective, protested due to a more general anti-war sentiment.</p>\n<p>“So much of our country’s resources go into war and killing and environmental destruction,” Yoshizumi said. “The U.S. is an advanced and rich country, and yet we don’t have things like free education and free health care, like most advanced countries do. All of that is because of misplaced priorities, like the war in Iraq.”</p>\n<p>Some of the audience attended not in support, but instead to critique and gain perspective on Rice.<br>\n“We are not here in support of her, we just want an abstract of what she’s about,” audience member Jeff Smith said.</p>\n<p>“She was definitely a part of it… she’s guilty,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Inside, Rice talked identity politics, criticizing Donald Trump’s “America First” slogan.<br>\nShe contested that a “confident country” is focused on an international level of “larger good,” not just the success of Americans. Rice defined this as spreading democracy and balancing trade.</p>\n<p>In her Q&amp;A session, Rice voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movement, but referred to kneeling for the National Anthem as divisive symbolism.</p>\n<p>The self-proclaimed feminist also criticized the #MeToo movement. She said that though she overall supported and praised the purpose it served, she warned against oversensitivity of followers.</p>\n<p>Rice voiced concern that young women wouldn’t be equipped for the real world, stating she hoped the movement didn’t teach that “women can’t take care of themselves, because they can.”</p>\n<p>On immigration policy, Rice took a positive approach, stating, “immigration has been the lifeblood of this country.”</p>\n<p>Rice reproached Trump’s decision to build a wall between the Mexico and United States border, stating that “a wall doesn’t have to be a physical thing.”</p>\n<p>She backed this argument by claiming that net immigration from Mexico is zero. Rice said that Central America is the source of criminal immigrants, making the wall ineffective.</p>\n<p>Though Rice called the past year’s number of 40,000 refugees under the Trump administration lacking, she did suggest capping the number at 70,000.</p>\n<p>She broke down the modern system for integrating immigrants through private charities. She explained that a number above 70,000 would be too strenuous on the system, potentially causing it to collapse.</p>\n<p>Despite protests and critics, a large number of attendees showed support for Rice by reflecting on her accomplishments.</p>\n<p>“Her education, she was a pianist, she was considered to be a position in the football commission, and she’s a woman… this shows she’s a well-rounded leadership type,” Santa Barbara resident Grace Johnson said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80762\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80762\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/condoleezza-rice-comes-to-santa-barbara-protests-ensue/","id":3927,"author":{"id":75,"name":"Eric Moon"},"related":[3926,3925,3924],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Juice It Up!

The new store opened next to HiWi Tropical Fusion on 6555 Pardall Road as part of a franchise partnership between the two stores.</p>\n<p>The juice bar will sell blended smoothies, açaí and pitaya bowls and pressed and raw juices.</p>\n<p>The Friday grand opening included live music, prize giveaways and local vendor product samplings.</p>\n<p>Monica Martinez, president of HiWi Inc. and the new Juice It Up! location, said the company wanted to bring the juice bar to I.V. to offer a healthy food option to the UC Santa Barbara campus and community.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! will not serve beer or wine, Martinez said, because “there’s already enough alcohol in I.V.”</p>\n<p>“We know that it’s really good for profit, but we’re not here just for profit. We’re really here to try to be a sustainable business,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! is one of many raw juice bar companies HiWi Fusion considered partnering with before making their final decision. Other candidates for the juice locale included Jamba Juice and Maui Wowi.</p>\n<p>Martinez said she chose to partner with Juice It Up! because of its high quality products.</p>\n<p>“They actually have a full-time food scientist who does hours and hours of testing to make sure that it’s the best and healthiest product out there,” she said.</p>\n<p>Juice It Up!’s notability as a brand was also a factor in the final decision, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“People would be more familiar with something that they’re used to,” said Martinez. “There are a lot of students at UCSB that are from Southern California, and Juice It Up! is originally from Southern California.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said she hopes the option to order Juice It Up! online will be helpful for students that do not have time to eat breakfast. Customers can place an order online and pick it up on their way to class, Martinez said.</p>\n<p>“Most students do not have time to stop and eat breakfast, so a smoothie or a bowl or a protein shake or raw juice is often a quick breakfast for them,” she said. “They’ll have their drink ready to go and they can have their breakfast on their way to class.”</p>\n<p>Juice It Up! takes online orders through their website <em>hiwifusion.com/menu</em> and offers pick-up and delivery through SBmenus and UberEATS.</p>\n<p>The new store will be open between 7 a.m. and 10:00 p.m Monday through Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79846\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79846\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-21/juice-it-up-celebrates-opening-in-isla-vista/","id":4372,"author":{"id":75,"name":"Eric Moon"},"related":[4371,4370,4369],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/75"}},"__N_SSG":true}
