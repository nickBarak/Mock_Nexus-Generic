Both Shofet and Shahaf are working together to address food insecurity, specifically for those who only eat halal and kosher food, by providing them with food that fits their dietary needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Halal and Kosher Program creates weekly grocery bags for low income students who follow Halal and Kosher dietary restrictions,” Shahaf said in an email. “Every week the bags have a breakfast option, a set of instant lunches, potential snacks, and a dinner option.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Shahaf, the program is currently funded through the UCSB Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce; it also partners with the Isla Vista Food Cooperative (I.V. Co-op), which provides the food at discount prices and assists with transportation. Shahaf and the I.V. Co-op communicate through weekly emails and occasional meetings to plan what food items will be in the bags for that week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know how we would be running this program without the Isla Vista Food Cooperative’s charitable nature and the discounted pricing they offer us,” Shahaf stated. “Their amazing team, as well as the food bank employees, help me load all the food into a van headed to the food bank, where we assemble and place the bags.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf explained that the Associated Students Food Bank also plays an integral role in the program running smoothly, as its employees assist in picking up bulk orders, assemble bags and help sign in Halal and Kosher Program participants. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shahaf said she constantly communicates with leading members of campus organizations such as the I.V. Co-op and the UCSB Sustainability to ensure everything is running smoothly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also check in and receive feedback from other leaders on campus like the Middle Eastern Resource Center, and the Muslim Student Association for new ideas and to see how we can improve or better serve our joint Muslim and Jewish Community,” Shahaf added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to Shahaf, the importance of the program extends beyond its day-to-day operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Keeping Kosher is how I keep my ancestors and my cultural past close to my heart, and it is one of the only aspects of Judaism in my daily life,” she explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I imagine it is similar for many Muslim students who keep Halal, as they are reminded of Islamic persecution around the world. I want to make it possible for every Jewish and Muslim student to keep their religious dietary restrictions, and to feel seen and supported by this campus.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this

The town hall is the third of four scheduled meetings, the next to be held on Feb. 4 at UC San Diego. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall began with an introduction from Regent Gareth Elliott, who explained that the purpose of the special committee is to consider candidates and recommend an individual to succeed President Napolitano.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nathan Brostrom, UC systemwide executive vice president and chief financial officer, initiated the public forum, urging the special committee to “nominate candidates who are deeply committed to the mission of social mobility in the Central Valley and in California.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brostrom said he hopes that this commitment to social mobility will “not just be in underrepresented communities or in socioeconomic status, but also in geography representing the Central Valley,” as well as assist the </span><a href=\"https://excel.ucmerced.edu/first-generation-stem-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70% of students at UC Merced (UCM) who are first-generation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with talking about the UC system as a whole, Brostrom focused specifically on the campus of Merced, urging the committee to look at candidates who understand how much UCM still relies on financial aid and administrative support from central UC offices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As many other speakers — comprised of staff and executive members employed at UCM — came to speak before the board, they expressed concerns over the campus’s financial needs and its capability to fund the needed educational growth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In recent years, as UCM is on the rise and our students and faculty grow, staff hiring has not kept up,” Priya Lakireddy, president of UCM Staff Assembly, said. “Many of the staff are asked to do more and take on additional responsibilities without resources or compensation.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cindi Zimmerman, campus risk manager at UCM, presented a similar financial concern. She discussed the growing pains UCM is experiencing as a young campus, such as “funding constraints [that] create roadblocks for additional full-time employees, which are desperately needed do to the work in order to support the faculty and staff.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from financial considerations, other UCM speakers encouraged the special committee to select a candidate that mirrors Napolitano’s drive and ambition to continue furthering the academic successes of the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hope you will consider President Napolitano’s passion and determination as baseline qualities when choosing candidates to succeed her,” Chris Abrescy, executive director of Alumni Relations, said. “At UCM, we need a president who will understand the Central Valley and its desperate needs for teaching, research and public service that uplifts this economy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The next President should consider how, in the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/us/university-california-merced-latino-students.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">words of New York Times</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, UC Merced is and should be the future face of the UC,” Abrescy said. </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92562\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-05/uc-merced-urges-uc-regents-special-committee-at-town-hall-meeting-to-consider-their-needs-in-selecting-next-uc-president/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92562\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-05/uc-merced-urges-uc-regents-special-committee-at-town-hall-meeting-to-consider-their-needs-in-selecting-next-uc-president/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-05/uc-merced-urges-uc-regents-special-committee-at-town-hall-meeting-to-consider-their-needs-in-selecting-next-uc-president/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-05/uc-merced-urges-uc-regents-special-committee-at-town-hall-meeting-to-consider-their-needs-in-selecting-next-uc-president/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-05/uc-merced-urges-uc-regents-special-committee-at-town-hall-meeting-to-consider-their-needs-in-selecting-next-uc-president/","id":3467,"author":{"id":276,"name":"Daniel Seo"},"related":[3466,3465,3464],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/276"}},"__N_SSG":true}
