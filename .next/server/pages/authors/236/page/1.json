The piano-like instrument is played with fists and feet, rather than fingers. The stronger the batons are pushed, the harder the clapper strikes the bell and thus the greater the volume produced, Arai explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The most important thing I want is for people to realize that it’s a musical instrument … [the hour chime] that part is automated but the music you hear is played by a real person,”  he said. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89703\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-02/let-the-bells-ring-carillon-concert-series-celebrates-towers-50th-anniversary/storke-bells_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-89703\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89703\" data-attachment-id=\"89703\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-02/let-the-bells-ring-carillon-concert-series-celebrates-towers-50th-anniversary/storke-bells_siavash-ghadiri_online_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Storke Bells_Siavash Ghadiri_ONLINE_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89703\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Storke-Bells_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE_2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89703\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 61-bell, 5-octave carillon is the 11th largest in North America, according to Arai. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arai has been playing the instrument since his time at UC Berkeley, where he received his undergraduate degree in mathematics and statistics and later obtained his master’s degree in mathematics at UC Los Angeles.

There are less than 700 carillons in the world, Arai explained, and less than 180 in North America. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a carillion instructor, Arai hosts concerts, plays on the weekends and continues teaching students, three at any given time, how to play. These students get to practice in the tower on the weekends as well as on the practice carillon in the basement of the music department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It can be a hard instrument… No other instrument uses similar motions, except the organ, to a small extent, with the foot pedals,” Arai explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arai’s next formal carillion performance will be for the official 50th anniversary concert for Storke Tower on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019 at 2 p.m.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> He</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be performing several works, including some commissioned specifically for the 50th anniversary of the carillon.
