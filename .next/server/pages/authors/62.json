QLess aims to streamline this process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We see a real surge typically after lunch. I know it’s a challenge to get up in the morning early, but if you want to see advising on a drop-in basis, mornings are great.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This program is available for general and honors advising located at 1117 Cheadle Hall, pre-health admission advising located at 2105 North Hall and pre-law advising located at 2105 North Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple noted that due to an unusually large freshman class this year, there is an increased demand in advising lines. He pointed out that the students coming to academic advising also have more nuanced academic backgrounds to work with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Entering first-year students have more complex records when they get here. They have AP classes, a lot of them did IB, a lot more students are doing dual enrollment, we have more international students who have complicated records,” he said.  “So in order to figure out what they’ve done and what they need to do, there’s more advising necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advising department has also greatly expanded in order to address that need in the last decade, he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As recently as 10 years ago, there were maybe six or eight advisers for the whole college, and now, depending on some variables involving staff turnovers and leaves and things like that, we’re, like, 18, 22 [advisors]. We’ve grown a lot.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stopple also said that he hopes there will be a transition away from physical paperwork to digital alternatives in terms of petitions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’d like to get rid of paper petitions. That’s obviously insane in the 21st century to be carrying pieces of paper around and standing in line, and that’s something we’re moving toward as well.”</span></p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-84595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AFSCME workers went on strike from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The October strikes saw thousands of participants statewide, according to a press release sent out by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 spokesperson, John de los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Protestors were joined by students, faculty and members of supporting unions.</p>\n<p>Several politicians, including California State Assembly Member Monique Limón, also came to speak in solidarity.</p>\n<p>“We’re here today because UC has not been able to negotiate a fair contract,” Babe Gonzalez, a medical assistant at UCSB Student Health, said.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez said workers have no protection against emergency layoffs in their contracts, which Gonzales believes is a bigger issue than wage increases.</p>\n<p>“What good is a raise today if they’re not going to guarantee that we would have no emergency layoffs, [that] they won’t be outsourcing our jobs and our job security? You can give us a raise today, and if that’s not in our contract, you can fire us tomorrow,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>The workers who went on strike also expressed concern for their wages in relation to the high cost of living in the Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p>Francisco Garcias, a facilities department worker who has been with UC for 22 years, said the cost of living is a huge issue UC workers face.</p>\n<p>“People have to drive an hour away from their jobs at the university to be able to make rent, to have a home … Our pay does not cover cost of living,” Garcias said.</p>\n<p>University of California Office of the President (UCOP) sent a statement to the Nexus on Wednesday that countered AFSCME demands for increased pay.</p>\n<p>“AFSCME patient care and service workers are already compensated at or above market rates, along with affordable health insurance and generous retirement benefits,” Danielle Smith, UCOP media communications specialist, said in an email.</p>\n<p>“An 8 percent pay increase for each of four years is not possible for taxpayer-supported institutions. The union wants more money – more than any other group at the university. This is why they are striking, plain and simple. AFSCME leaders have done little to truly help their union members.”</p>\n<p>The statement also said AFSCME leaders are hypocritical because AFSCME increased its membership fees in January, raising the monthly dues from $78 to $120.</p>\n<p>“AFSCME leadership has no qualms pointing a finger at UC while choosing to take a larger portion of their members’ paychecks.”</p>\n<p>A Supreme Court decision made in June of this year, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1466_2b3j.pdf\"><em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em></a><em>,</em> made membership dues for California public employee unions optional. The decision barred union collection of fair share fees, meaning that the union’s members are paying voluntarily.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCOP said AFSCME leaders are “spreading false information” about employee displacement.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, the number of patient care employees has increased by 18.9 percent and service workers by 14.4 percent, which is “consistent” with the growth of all union workers by 9.9 percent, Smith said in the UCOP statement.</p>\n<p>“UC hopes AFSCME leaders, given their wasted efforts, will now engage in productive, sensible negotiations, rather than blindly declare victory for a demonstration that moved them no closer to a better deal.”</p>\n<p>Students are also oftentimes confused about whether raising workers’ wages would affect tuition costs, according to Melissa Perez, an on-campus senator for Associated Students (A.S.)</p>\n<p>“I think one of the most common misconceptions about this strike, or why students oppose it, is that they believe that if the workers’ wages go up our tuition has to go up as well,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>“Realistically, the funding to pay for workers’ wages comes from the state’s budget, and our tuition is determined by the Board of Regents. They stand with us when we lobby and strike against tuition hikes, and so we have to stand with them when they’re trying to get a living wage.”</p>\n<p>While the strike did not result in resolved demands, it brought attention to the issues that UC workers face, lead groundskeeper Juan Donato said.</p>\n<p>“The purpose is to voice our concerns and that’s why we [strike],” Donato said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/afscme-strikes-come-to-an-end-ucop-states-afscme-strikes-were-wasted-efforts/","id":2200,"author":{"id":62,"name":"Emily Komessar"},"related":[2199,2198,2197],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/62"}},"__N_SSG":true}
