The goal of the proposal is to make transitioning to a four-year university more feasible for students. The bill would allow for the application of AP credit to college units at community colleges throughout California.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the bill will save low-income students time and money by transferring college credits from AP exams to community college.</p>\n<p>“AB 1985 not only builds a uniform policy to improve students’ time to degree and transfer, ultimately saving tuition costs for students and their families, but it will also prevent discrepancies on AP scores between CCCs,” Williams said in a news release.</p>\n<p>According to Lourdes Jimenez, Williams’ chief of staff, there are currently 24 community colleges that require an AP score of 4 for college credit, six community colleges that require a score of 5 and 10 community colleges that have no policies, out of the 113 California Community Colleges.</p>\n<p>“This inconsistency creates confusion and is an unnecessary barrier to students entering the community colleges in our state who have earned college credit,” Jimenez said. “Assemblymember William believes it’s important to have uniform policies that are clear to students.”</p>\n<p>Jimenez said the office has communicated with administration and officials from the UC, California State University and College Board to maintain the students’ interest when implementing the bill.</p>\n<p>“We have focused on making sure this bill does not affect the work that has already been achieved by the college segments dealing with transferability to make sure a student’s transition in and out of college happens sooner,” Jimenez said.</p>\n<p>Luz Reyes-Martin, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) public information officer, said she supports the bill because there is currently no standardized policy for awarding AP credits across all community colleges.</p>\n<p>“I think what is very positive about the assemblyman’s proposed bill is that it would create a uniform policy across the 113 California Community Colleges,” Reyes-Martin said. “It’s part of our mission to facilitate and support students who want to transfer on to a UC or another four-year university.”</p>\n<p>According to Reyes-Martin, SBCC currently has its own comprehensive AP credit transfer system in which students are awarded general education units for passing an exam with a score of 3 or higher.</p>\n<p>“We have a very good relationship with the assemblymember and his office, so we are definitely looking forward to talking with them and … helping give them any advice or any best practices to offer with that policy,” Reyes-Martin said. “We’ll definitely be looking at the bill and checking it to see how it will affect our existing system.”</p>\n<p>According to Spencer Barr, Santa Barbara High School college and career counselor, close to 50 percent of Santa Barbara High School’s senior class enroll at SBCC for community college.</p>\n<p>“Out of those students, we don’t have a ton of them that are taking multiple AP classes,” Barr said. “It’s usually a couple of classes, maybe as many as four classes that students are trying to get credits for.”</p>\n<p>Barr said although SBCC offers students in Santa Barbara two years of free tuition, he supports the plan to alleviate the financial challenges of all students attending community college.</p>\n<p>“[SBCC] has just introduced a new plan where any local high school student in Santa Barbara, assuming you graduated from a local high school, can go to SBCC completely free for two full years,” Barr said. “That financial hardship is not as much of a financial hardship anymore because everything is paid for.”</p>\n<p>Barr said he supports a uniform AP credit system across all community colleges because it would decrease the time required for students to transfer into a four-year university.</p>\n<p>“It would be great if there is a standardized platform for the California Community Colleges in terms of accepting credits,” Barr said. “That would speed up the transfer process for any students who are looking to go that road with two years at community college and transferring to a four-year university.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>The Office of the A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) is now asking for feedback from UCSB students on the content of UC Board of Regents’ first “Principles Against Intolerance,” which is currently being developed by a working group within the Board.</p>\n<p>The Principles Against Intolerance is a statement first drafted by the working group July 2015 stating what it considers to be “intolerable” acts, including acts of discrimination and racism. The Office of the EVPSA asks students to share what they consider to be hate speech and to share their experiences with acts of hate via welisten@sa.ucsb.edu by Jan. 30. The feedback will then be sent to the Board, who will not see names of students who participate.</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, EVPSA and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major, said the Principles Against Intolerance aim to address all types of hate students might face on campus.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the statement against intolerance is to better understand the kind of challenges students are facing, not only in regards to anti-Semitism,” Mirza said, “but also in regards to anti-black, homophobia, racism and hate, which is unfortunately much more prevalent than people realize on the UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>Mirza said he encourages students to submit feedback in order to “take advantage of that opportunity” to communicate their experiences to the Regents.</p>\n<p>“I really want to encourage students who are affected by this issue and who are passionate about it to take the time to fill out their feelings and send it in to the email address provided, because it’s not often that the UC Regents takes this much student input in the crafting of policy,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>According to Aaron Jones, Graduate Student Association president, the Board will use feedback they receive to identify the main issues students face that should be addressed in the Principles Against Intolerance.</p>\n<p>“[The Board] will use the information by looking at the issues and challenges to address in the statement,” Jones said. “How to phrase the statement in a way that respects freedom of speech but also acknowledges the problems that people are facing and fully cover the broad scope of the issue.”</p>\n<p>Jones said Student Regent Avi Oved and Student Regent Designate Marcela Ramirez drafted a more “holistic” statement against hate speech despite requests from several Board members to tailor the statement to the issue of anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p>“It put the current student regent, who is Jewish, in a precarious position, because he essentially informed us that although it is important to him to fight anti-Semitism, he didn’t feel as though it was the only form of intolerance that needed to be identified,” Jones said. “We have to include intolerance against people of color, the LGBT community, women; it needed to be more inclusive.”</p>\n<p>Akshaya Natarajan, off-campus senator and second-year Asian American studies and political science double major, said the student regents, Oved and Ramirez, want to improve student representation at the Board through this opportunity to collect feedback.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s not often that the UC Regents takes this much student input in the crafting of policy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>“What the student regents this year wanted to do was to really increase the amount of student input on the statement of principles against intolerance,” Natarajan said. “I think it’s very much towards increasing student input and making sure students feel like they have the ability to give input on policy and official UC stances about free speeches.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan said she attended an open forum on the Principles at UCLA and witnessed many students with “charged” opinions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of it seemed to focus on the issue of divestment and general conversations of anti-Semitism and free speech on campus,” Natarajan said. “I think that’s the larger picture that we should be looking at: Perhaps not so much one conversation that happens, but perhaps the scope of all sorts of controversial discussions that happen on campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, some have expressed concerns that the Principles Against Intolerance will infringe upon the First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p>“I think that whole particular argument needs to be flushed out more because it’s just a way of pigeonholing the conversation to say, ‘I have the ability to say anything I want to’ and not have to face repercussions when that is legally is not the case,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jones said the statement would not affect classroom discussions between students and faculty.</p>\n<p>“The entity responsible for classroom experience is academic senate, it’s the faculty,” Jones said. “There may be the statement. There may be broader parameters that are put forth as ideals. But in terms of the academic environment, that is the sole responsibility of the faculty.”</p>\n<p>Jones said the discussion of hate speech and intolerance will still continue after the statement is complete.</p>\n<p>“My hope with the ongoing conversation is that something can be agreed upon now,” Jones said. Maybe it’s not the end-all, be-all, but we can continue working on it. So it’s not something that is static.”</p>\n<p>Natarajan said the statement is still very broad and could lead to interpretations that suggest violations of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pretty short statement, it’s not really all inclusive,” Natarajan said. “So it does leave a lot up to interpretation, and as a result of that, there is a lot of perhaps confusion on what these principles could mean.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, January 21, 2016 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67543\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67543\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-21/evpsa-principles-draft-calls-for-student-input/","id":2579,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2578,2577,2576],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

It’s been six years that my mom hasn’t been able to return to her home that my parents have worked for after so many years.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Salazar said many undocumented students are currently living in fear after news of the I.C.E. raids and deportations. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“A lot of people started celebrating New Years, but we started our year with fear,” Salazar said. “We think coming back to school would be a safe space because back at home, it’s not a safe space because our families and friends are in danger of being deported”. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Mariel Islas, second-year history of public policy major, said recent news of I.C.E. raids coupled with border patrol recruiters attending the career fair may trigger fear and panic in undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“When customs and border patrol comes to the career fair, C.A.P.S. should be on hand with more psychologists and therapists,” Islas said. “That way, students who do feel triggered have the ability and the means to contact someone in C.A.P.S. who are able to help them.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Islas said she collaborated with A.S. senators Alejandra Melgoza and Jose Magana, who proposed that she write a resolution.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Alejandra Melgoza, an off-campus senator and third-year Chican@ studies major, said she supports the resolution because of the stress and pressure undocumented students have to face while pursuing their education. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“There have been a lot of raids in our community,” Melgoza said. “There are articles that state they are continuing in Santa Barbara county, so this presents a lot of mental health stress not only on these students here in this community, but they also worry about their families back home, friends, community members.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In the fall of 2013, the 64th A.S Senate voted against passing “A Resolution in Support of Undocumented Student and Immigrant Communities,” which requested A.S. express no confidence toward former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, who is now president of the University of California.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Salazar said it is important for Senate to repair its relationship with the undocumented student population at UCSB in order to fully represent the student body. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Two years after, A.S. Senate voted down the previous resolution, Salazar said, “Now we’re back in the same place. We’re coming here for the 66th Senate to amend those actions and to really support undocumented students right now because undocumented students are facing really difficult times.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">“A Bill to Amend Lobby Corps Legal Code” and “A Bill to Update CFF By-Laws” were sent to Campus Affairs. “A Bill to Amend the Legal Code of the OSA Bill” and “A Resolution Requesting Immediate Action in Support of the Undocumented Community” were passed unanimously. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\n</p><p class=\"p4\">[Correction: This story originally read  “a resolution asking for ‘immediate’ action in support of those who immigrated to the country illegally.” The wording was changed to “those without legal status” to more accurately describe the purpose of the resolution.]</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

(IRS) after filing IRS Form 990 for three consecutive years, having failed to do so for 12 years prior.</p>\n<p>IRS Form 990 is a tax form for tax-exempt organizations which outlines organization activities and finances. By law, the University of California is exempt from filing an IRS Form 990 because it is recognized as a government affiliated organization under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 115 and IRC 501(c)(3). The IRS is currently deciding whether Associated Students is exempt from filing IRS Form 990 based on its affiliation with the UC.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Jimmy Villarreal said the current A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez addressed the IRS non-compliance issue by hiring lawyers to work with A.S. after she was hired in 2008.</p>\n<p>“From 2008 to 2012, that’s when we were in contact with lawyers,” Villarreal said. “Not just UC lawyers but we also brought in outside lawyers just to try to figure out where we were. We contacted the general counselor for the UC, so with their advice, we went to another lawyer who specializes in IRS matters.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) contacted her about the IRS non-compliance issue.</p>\n<p>“I had been working here in my office and UCOP called me up one day asking me why we haven’t been<strong> s</strong>ubmitting our own 990 document for the prior 12 years,” Marquez said. “I researched it and I found out the reason; prior to that there had been an understanding that turned out to be a misunderstanding.”</p>\n<p>According to Villarreal, A.S. did not file the form for 12 years due to confusion about the relationship between the UCen and UC.</p>\n<p>“The reason why we weren’t filing before that was because at the time, we shared the same track ID number with the UCen because technically we are in UCen property,” Villarreal said. “Because the University files for the UCen, the UCen thought the [University was] filing for Associated Students. But they were not.”</p>\n<p>Marquez said it is difficult to categorize the tax status of A.S because it follows policies from UC Regents, A.S. Legal Code and regulations as a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“The mix-up occurred because we are both a department for the campus and system, and we also hold our own tax ID number,” Marquez said. “Students wanting to be independent from the university have maintained both levels of responsibility.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said A.S. is working with lawyers to research whether A.S. should be recognized as a UC-affiliated organization.</p>\n<p>“We’re not even sure if we have to file 990s and that is still something we’re still trying to figure out with our lawyers because we’re under a governmental entity which is the University of California,” Villarreal said. “So even now we’re still working on exactly figuring out if this is something we have to do.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal said because A.S. has an unclear affiliation with the UC, he does not know whether A.S. will incur penalties from the IRS.</p>\n<p>“It is a possibility that there could be fines incurred, but I’m not really sure how much,” Villarreal said. “But we have the funds that we can use for that and we can take care of it if need be. I don’t expect that to happen, but it could.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year political science major Louis Mariano said the IRS compliance issues are mostly “small technical things” that must be fixed to maintain a nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p>“IRS issues have been present in the Association for the past few years and it is an issue that the A.S Executive Director has been dealing with, informing the president and senate with updates,” Mariano said in an email.</p>\n<p>Mariano said it is unlikely the student body will be affected by the A.S.’s non-compliance with the IRS as long as A.S. continues to communicate with the IRS.</p>\n<p>“Personally, I believe that there isn’t much impact for the student body and student fees as long as the issue is being dealt with, which the Executive Director has been doing as mentioned before,” Mariano said in an email.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66758\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66758\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-24/associated-students-issued-compliance-check-from-irs/","id":2593,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2592,2591,2590],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Latinx Town Hall To Offer Safe Space For Discussion","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MCC_File-Photo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Students will host a “Latinx Town Hall” Monday at 7 p.m. in the Graduate Student Association lounge at the MultiCultural Center to create a safe space for the Latino/a community.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Students will host a “Latinx Town Hall” Monday at 7 p.m. in the Graduate Student Association lounge at the MultiCultural Center to create a safe space for the Latino/a community.</p>\n<p>The town hall is a closed event open only to those who “identify with the Latinx community,” according to the Facebook event page, so that students feel comfortable discussing issues such as policing, safety and accessing resources. UCSB was named by the Hispanic Association of Colleges &amp; Universities in January as a Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI) after reaching 25 percent Hispanic enrollment in undergraduate and graduate programs.</p>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) Student Advocate General and fourth-year global studies and art double major Joseline Garcia, who is organizing the event along with Lorena Alvarez and Cassie Rubio, said the town hall will provide a space for students to voice their struggles and find ways to address them.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the town hall is to create a space where individuals who identify with the Latinx community can discuss issues that are pertinent to them,” Garcia said in an email. “Those issues can range from constant racial profiling, insufficient resources, displacement of Latinx families in I.V., etc.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said UCSB being an HSI does not necessarily mean Latino/a students are sufficiently represented on campus.</p>\n<p>“The number doesn’t show the retention percentage of the Latinx that are able to graduate,” Garcia said in an email. “It’s very rare to see a Latinx professor and graduate students on campus. This alone is one of the many reasons the town hall is essential. It is important to spark common conversation pertaining to how we want to be represented as a student body on campus.”</p>\n<p>Garcia said Latino/a students face discrimination that surfaces in many ways which are not “isolated” from one another.</p>\n<p>“It is important that all individuals understand that the terror faced by the 43 students in Ayotzinapa about a year ago, the racist remarks made by presidential candidates, the criminalization of brown bodies, inaccessibility of higher education to undocumented students, the cultural appropriation of Latinx culture in Halloween … are all interconnected,” Garcia said in an email.</p>\n<p>First-year Chican@ studies major Mara Tinajero said safe spaces allow students to connect with their community.</p>\n<p>“Classes like Chicano studies, spaces like El Congreso and spaces for people of color is something our campus needs to pay more attention to and possibly get more funding [for],” Tinajero said. “Those spaces are crucial because our students go to those and feel at home.”</p>\n<p>Tinajero said she thinks Latino/a students are represented better at UCSB than on most campuses, but there is still progress to be made.</p>\n<p>“I definitely feel that we have more representation on our campus than others because we are a Hispanic-serving institute,” Tinajero said. “I feel like our voices are heard louder than others, but I feel like it’s not enough. I feel like our voices need to be heard even more.”</p>\n<p>Tinajero said her experience attending this year’s Students of Color Conference at UC Berkeley allowed her to connect and draw strength from others in her community.</p>\n<p>“It was really comforting to see that some of the struggles I’ve been through, I haven’t been through them alone,” Tinajero said. “Seeing how people took those experiences and push through and triumphed helps.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Courtesy of St. George</p></div>\n<p>Independent housing developer Ed St. George of St. George Associates introduced a proposal earlier this year to convert Beach City apartments on Cliff Drive into dorms for Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) students.</p>\n<p>St. George plans to renovate the two-story apartments by adding a third story to accommodate up to 1,500 SBCC students. Existing kitchens will be removed for more space, and a new shared dining commons will be added. The proposal is currently in the second pre-application process under the City of Santa Barbara Planning Division.</p>\n<p>Planning Division Project Planner Daniel Gullett said the Santa Barbara Planning Commission will review the early concept of the project.</p>\n<p>“The applicant will be submitting another pre-application in January because there are so many large issues to address,” Gullett said. “The applicant will get more feedback from city staff and then put together a formal application.”</p>\n<p>Gullett said the Planning Commission is taking special caution with the proposal because the project is a new concept for the city.</p>\n<p>“It’s a unique project for the city. We don’t have any dormitories, and this particular project requires a conditional use permit from the Planning Commission,” Gullett said. “So there is a lot of discretion in the review. It would be the only dormitory in the city.”</p>\n<p>Gullett said the application process may take years to approve because the project is unique to Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“City council would have to approve the zone change and land use designation change to allow for the height, and Coastal Commission would have to certify,” Gullett said. “The design would also have to be approved by the Architectural Board of Review.”</p>\n<p>Suzanne Elledge Planning and Permitting Services Principal Planner Laurel Perez said the firm is currently developing the second pre-application package, which they will submit in early January.</p>\n<p>“We’ve engaged traffic and parking consultants, a project biologist and project archeologist that will look at the cultural resources that might be present on site,” Perez said. “We’re completing those technical studies that will help address many of the questions that the city has identified in relationship to this project.”</p>\n<p>According to Perez, the project is still in its early stages and will continue to address concerns such as parking issues, noise and neighborhood compatibility.</p>\n<p>“Ed St. George’s primary objective for this project is to create a student environment that positively interacts with the local community,” Perez said. “Hopefully together we can come up with a project that addresses community concerns and help to meet a long overdue student housing need.”</p>\n<p>Perez said many other community colleges in the nation are facing similar housing issues because of increasing enrollment.</p>\n<p>“I was surprised to learn that this is not a unique situation that SBCC is facing,” Perez said. “We are seeing an increase in the number of students who are attending a community college that provide excellent education.”</p>\n<p>According to SBCC President Lori Gaskin, less than 15 of the 113 colleges in the California Community College system have dormitories.</p>\n<p>“Dormitories are not funded by the state for community colleges and are not part of the mission,” Gaskin said. “Those [community colleges with dorms] tend to be in locations that are very remote or are servicing remote geographic regions.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said Beach City Apartments are close to campus but unaffiliated with the college.</p>\n<p>“It existed for a long time, but this particular developer bought it a couple of years ago and is seeking to increase the capacity of living apartments,” Gaskin said.<br>\nGaskin said the proposal might help with low vacancy rates and high rental fees in Santa Barbara, which have impacted student enrollment rates at SBCC since 2009.</p>\n<p>“This fall semester we are down in enrollment by over four percent. When we reached out to potential students on why they applied but chose not to enroll, they talked about the cost of living,” Gaskin said. “The cost of living competes with the cost of going to school, so it’s really hard on our students.”</p>\n<p>SBCC student and third-year communication major Allie Trice said it was easy for her to find housing in Isla Vista because she had friends from UCSB living in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I chose to live here because all of my friends lived here since they went to UCSB. I didn’t really have any friends at SBCC,” Trice said. “It was convenient. It was nice already knowing people living here.”</p>\n<p>Trice said housing in I.V. and the Santa Barbara area is expensive because of its proximity to the beach.</p>\n<p>“When I first moved down here, I was like, ‘Wow. I’m paying for living in a double as much as you’d pay for a whole apartment where I’m from,’” Trice said. “I understand that it’s expensive because we live right down the street from the beach.”</p>\n<p>Trice said the proposal would be a convenient option for SBCC students struggling to find affordable housing near campus.</p>\n<p>“I would never personally do it because I like living [in I.V.],” Trice said. “But I know that would be a really good option for many students, because I know that at city college, there is a struggle to get housing there, and it’s expensive as well.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, November 19, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Halloweens, during which videos of rowdy street parties, car wrecks and police riots emerged on social media. UC Berkeley students and administrators attribute the rowdy crowds to both Halloween and the UC Berkeley vs. University of Southern California (USC) football game at Memorial Stadium on Saturday.</p>\n<p>With the absence of signature Halloween festivities in I.V., which were replaced by university-sponsored concerts and events and the emergence of Berkeley as a new hotspot, students are questioning if UCSB lives up to its status as a Halloween destination and its Princeton Review ranking of sixth best party school in the nation.</p>\n<p>Communications Manager for Student Affairs at UC Berkeley Adam Michael Ratliff said campus law enforcement is still investigating the cause of the parties and rioting.</p>\n<p>“Student Affairs leaders are planning to gather the facts about this weekend’s incident to better understand what occurred, who was involved,” Ratliff said in an email. “They will continue to work with all of our various student organizations to promote safe events for the Berkeley community.”</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley Police Department Lieutenant Marc DeCoulode said the presence of USC students at the football game and tailgating may have contributed to the rowdy crowds in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>“I think what contributed to it was that Halloween fell on a Saturday, which doesn’t happen really often and the fact that we had the USC football game so there was some extra people along fraternity row,” DeCoulode said. “Both some of our people and USC people [were] outside, so it was a little more crowded than usual.”</p>\n<p>UC Berkeley student and second-year environmental economics and public policy major Alyssa Nguyen said last year’s Halloween weekend ended early in the evening due to stricter law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“This year I think [police] were more lenient; this year it seems that the parties were shut down later than last year,” Nguyen said. “Last year, there were a lot of incidents of college student deaths in parties. The parties were dead silent at 10 p.m. to 11p.m., and all the parties were not big. It wasn’t like anything where everyone was allowed in and having fun.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said party-goers on Channing Way playing loud music and vandalizing cars were later constrained by Berkeley police department at the scene.</p>\n<p>“I heard that there was an individual’s party so crazy they brought it out to the streets. Everyone was jumping on a car, and dancing on the car,” Nguyen said. “Apparently a guy dressed up as Jesus was also dancing on the car and everyone was yelling ‘Jesus! Jesus!’ But the windows cracked and everything. The police pretty much blockaded everyone inside on the street.”</p>\n<p>Berkeley resident Nina Krishnan said the weekend was an outlier compared to what typically happens in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>“The last Halloween at Cal was on a Friday, and it was quite disappointing. I can definitely say compared to last year, there were far more people on the streets at Berkeley — especially Frat Row,” Krishnan said “More people, bigger crowds — it was lit. It was definitely lit on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Krishnan said she witnessed a street party that escalated into car vandalism and then chaotic running from the center of the party. Krishnan said she did not witness any police or security at the scene and didn’t know what motivated people to run.</p>\n<p>“It was more of a general party on the street at first. It wasn’t dangerous or violent — it wasn’t a riot — that’s not what I would call the first part. But then something snapped — in a flash, things got very messy as people started smashing cars and jumping on cars,” Krishnan said. “They definitely cracked the window and windshield and then in a few minutes, there was straight-out mayhem. People started running in all directions.”</p>\n<p>The unprecedented Halloween party scene in Berkeley drew a sharp contrast to the quieter-than-ever weekend in I.V.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Sheriff Department Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover said based on low turnout this Halloween, UCSB students are beginning to realize the danger of inviting out-of-towners and having open-door policies for parties.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had huge crowds for Halloween especially, on a weekend. We were prepared for a large turnout; however, the last several years we’ve noticed a significant decrease every year in turnout for Halloween,” Hoover said. “The fact that there is heavy law enforcement, there was no music, parking was very strict and the students aren’t inviting out-of-towners — we are seeing it reflect in the number.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year environmental studies and Chican@ studies double-major Carmen Mares said her freshman year Halloween weekend was surrounded by “negative vibes” due to many out-of-towner-induced safety concerns.</p>\n<p>“DP was filled with people. Everybody dressed up, some people getting a little too crazy. We’d walk a block, and in the next block, there are, like, cops having to get people on the sidewalk because they were too drunk,” Mares said. “It was intense because it was a playground for a lot of people to come.”</p>\n<p>Mares said she enjoyed her Halloween weekend this year because of the safety and the lack of worry over out-of-towners.</p>\n<p>“Halloween in I.V. was really exciting in the sense that we’re all dressed up, we all have fun and we don’t have to worry about school for a couple of days. Even if you’re not partying and you’re just walking down the streets in I.V., everybody’s just happy,” Mares said.</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President and fourth-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian also said Halloween this year was significantly different from her freshman year.</p>\n<p>“The first year there was crazy amounts of people, and I think it is the last year before there was super enforcement of police,” Hashemian said. “[This year] there were more volunteers out there than actual people, which shows, like, how great of a job to keep this a local event.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major Jorge Escobar said due to I.V.’s party reputation, many police and security resources are assigned to I.V. during Halloween and Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“Every UC sends a certain amount of allocation of cops to Santa Barbara because they know a certain percentage of their school population will come to Santa Barbara,” Escobar said “That’s why you would see things like ‘UCLA Campus Police’ here in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said she hopes I.V. can reduce police presence in the future if Halloween continues to be a local event.</p>\n<p>“I loved what happened, and I guess it’s one year but if it happens in four or five years, then it becomes a trend,” Hashemian said. “Hopefully we can spend less money on cops coming here and also changing the culture, which is what we really need.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead said she noticed fewer out-of-towners and more community bonding despite heavy law enforcement within the area.</p>\n<p>“I was walking on Del Playa and I saw the police playing Frisbee with students; I saw students taking pictures with the police, chatting with the police,” Armistead said. “But you can tell they were from the area because they weren’t looking to trash the place, they were just looking to be with their community.”<br>\nAccording to Krishnan, this Halloween weekend doesn’t reflect the culture and reputation of UC Berkeley as a university and the community of Berkeley.</p>\n<p>“I personally don’t think you would go to Berkeley for the parties,” Krishnan said. “There are other things that were far more memorable at Berkeley than the parties, such as the food, culture [and] people. That’s the vibe you get from the city.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen said this weekend doesn’t change or increase Berkeley’s party reputation because they typically experience the same amount of parties as other colleges in the nation.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we’re known to be work hard, play really hard. I think for [party] reputation, we don’t really have a matter of say in it,” Nguyen said. “I think for us we don’t care about the reputation — I have a feeling that it’s just Berkeley always has something going on every weekend where we really enjoy ourselves.”<br>\nHashemian said she is glad UCSB is losing its party school reputation.</p>\n<p>“It’s unfortunate that Berkeley had an insane [Halloween weekend], but insane as in having 3,000 people when, like, we have 16,000. I’m glad that we’re losing that reputation because it’s a reputation that doesn’t really represent us.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said UCSB’s party reputation is irrelevant compared to the university’s quality of education and on-campus diversity.</p>\n<p>“I think, ultimately, our reputation defines the quality of our degree,” Armistead said. “I think bringing Halloween down to a manageable fun time is the best thing for our community and education.”</p>\n<p>Mares said UCSB’s party reputation will not change just because this year’s Halloween was safer and more local.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it has that big of an impact in our SB party scene or reputation because people still party. It’s just for that specific event nobody wants that to happen. Nobody wants riots or [to feel] unsafe,” Mares said. “I think it was a community agreement — ‘Okay, we’re a party school — we party all the time. But hey, this is our school. A lot of the locals want to feel safe. We still party but we’ll party in a different way.’”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Yang said the university’s efforts to preserve I.V. have been effectual.</p>\n<p>“As evidenced by the calm Halloween weekend, our combined efforts are making a cultural change in Isla Vista and helping to create a surrounding community that complements the preeminent academic stature of our university,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 and 4 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

seminar titled “Citizen Engagement (and Disengagement) in Response to Climate Change” to discuss the communication of climate change at Bren Hall Thursday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Levine presented research on how personalizing information about environmental issues affects people’s attitudes. Levine’s research is based on an experiment in which he gave sheets presenting the issue of climate change to different subject groups with varying degrees of urgency and observed which participants chose to sign a petition in support of political action on climate change. He found those who received more personalized, urgent information were less likely to want to engage in a solution.</p>\n<p>Levine said people become less willing to conserve resources when climate change is presented as an urgent, personalized issue.</p>\n<p>“It might have cognitive consequences which might decrease the belief that because the really important goal is difficult to achieve, perhaps what I need to do is conserve my resources to focus on those goals,” Levine said. “What we are finding is that seemingly helpful rhetoric can backfire in [a] really important and consequential way, and that it is important to highlight that,” Levine said.</p>\n<p>Bren Environmental Science and Management (EMS) graduate student Michelle Graff said Levine’s research contradicted her preexisting ideas.</p>\n<p>“It is a belief that you should make things more personal because somebody can find those connections,” Graff said. “So I did think it was really interesting that sometimes that actually does the exact opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to Graff, using fear tactics to motivate people to act on environmental issues is ineffective.</p>\n<p>“There has generally been a shift in climate change communication to it being a doomsday kind of thing,” Graff said. “It will be difficult, but there are ways to approach it in a manageable way — more of focusing on people’s ability of what they can get done.”</p>\n<p>Bren EMS graduate student Tova Handelman said Levine’s research reveals why people are often pessimistic about environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“Maybe one of the reasons that the messaging against climate change has been so effective [is] because it kind of gives people the option to not do anything about it” Handelman said.</p>\n<p>Sierra Club member Robert Bernstein said Levine’s research is “priceless.”</p>\n<p>“Somebody has actually done evidential research on what it is that motivates people to do environmental action,” Bernstein said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65722\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65722\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-23/adam-seth-levine-hosts-seminar-discussing-presentation-of-climate-change/","id":2645,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2644,2643,2642],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Professor at UCSB To Give T.E.D.

Talks Live in New York City on Nov. 2 in Town Hall Theater to discuss the “Education Revolution.”</p>\n<p>The talk will focus on reforming education curriculums in public schools to better serve marginalized, “at-promise” students. Rios said he was motivated by his personal journey in overcoming adversities to research the education systems within public schools and their effects on marginalized students.</p>\n<p>According to Rios, the T.E.D. Talk will focus on his work in developing a curriculum for high school “push-outs” who have been victimized and criminalized by schools.</p>\n<p>“They get punished overwhelmingly, they get reported to police, they get told ‘you’re not allowed in school’ because they’re truant,” Rios said. “They end up in the streets and become vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>Rios said many struggling high school students receive mostly informational support from teachers and emotional support is largely overlooked.</p>\n<p>“We just see you as a student, an empty container to be filled with knowledge, that doesn’t have anything to offer me as an educator except to sit there and take notes,” Rios said. “Right now, a lot of emotional connection is lost in the educational system.”</p>\n<p>Rios also said he wants to advocate for educational curriculum based on restorative justice rather than punishment.</p>\n<p>“The best way to teach kids a lesson when they mess up is to give them love, connection, emotional support and, of course, holding them accountable,” Rios said. “We need more restorative justice.”</p>\n<p>Last April, Rios spoke at T.E.D.xUCSB, a locally organized T.E.D. event featuring UCSB professors from various departments. In his talk, Rios said the generation currently in higher education is sometimes considered the “dumbest” and most “narcissistic,” but he does not believe this to be true.</p>\n<p>“We got it all wrong — politicians, education systems, the media,” Rios said. “In national surveys and local studies, we’re finding that your generation craves emotional connection — that your generation actually empathizes in a larger, deeper way than former generations.”</p>\n<p>Also at the T.E.D.x event, Rios said educators need to employ a more emotional method when teaching the millennial generation, as it is more focused on personal connection and social impact than generations before.</p>\n<p>“When we teach to the heart, the mind follows,” Rios said. “When we connect with [students] in an emotional way, in a compassionate way, it opens up avenues for them to learn in an academic setting.”</p>\n<p>According to Rios, presenting in New York will be an important opportunity to convey his message about education reform.</p>\n<p>“I have the potential to leave a message to the world about how we could help kids that are on the street corners lost, kids that are abused, kids that society has forgotten about, kids that have been called criminals and thugs,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Second-year undeclared major Navid de Leede said Rios’s sociology class encouraged him to take action to improve the educational achievement gap at his old high school.</p>\n<p>“We went to Professor Rios’s office hours and asked him, because what are you gonna do with a problem that’s been ingrained for years in our specific hometown?” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>Second-year pre-biology student Anthony Lavezzo said Rios helped jump-start the educational program with de Leede at his high school.</p>\n<p>“He was more like guiding us rather than pushing his own philosophy. He gave us recognition after we developed our project,” Lavezzo said.</p>\n<p>According to de Leede, Rios spoke extensively about educational inequality against under-privileged students during his lectures.</p>\n<p>“We learned that he was very passionate about not leaving students behind because of their financial situation or their socioeconomic background,” de Leede said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65681\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65681\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/professor-at-ucsb-to-give-t-e-d-talk-about-reform-of-education/","id":2675,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[2674,2673,2672],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SBCC President to Retire After Four-Year Service","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gaskin_Courtesy-of-SBCC.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gaskin_Courtesy-of-SBCC.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1","description":"Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) President Lori Gaskin announced Monday her decision to retire after the end of the 2015-16 school year.

Gaskin was President of West Valley College for three years prior to her appointment as SBCC’s President in July 2012. Gaskin focused on a variety of issues including fiscal transparency for the college, campus facility modernization and addressing SBCC student concerns in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Gaskin said her decision to retire was partially due to SBCC’s positive accreditation by the Accrediting Commission for the Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.</p>\n<p>According to Gaskin, a major focus during her presidency was to close the student achievement gap between different ethnicities.</p>\n<p>“We’ve received several funds to experiment and launch innovative programs to close that gap or disparity,” Gaskin said. “We’ve also ramped up our academic counseling support. We had one of the higher ratios in the state when it came to student academic counseling ratios.”</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of SBCC Jack Friedlander said Gaskin smoothly transitioned into her role during her first year of presidency.</p>\n<p>“She came in and calmed the waters at the college and in the community and helped reestablish relationships internally and externally,” Friedlander said “She didn’t come in with a preconceived agenda”.</p>\n<p>According to Friedlander, the recruitment process for a new president is in its early stages.</p>\n<p>“We have a profile of what the ideal candidate would bring,” Friedlander said. “Particularly, people who apply write an essay to write about how their experiences and characteristics align with what we’re looking for and how they would deal with the challenges our campus is facing.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Associated Students President and second-year business administration major Isaac Eaves said Gaskin listened to student voices on campus.</p>\n<p>“She always had the time to communicate with students and build a connection,” Eaves said. “She’s been working hard to make sure that we have a voice because in the past — there’s been a lot of micromanaging from the Board of Trustees and down.”</p>\n<p>SBCC Student Trustee and political science and sociology double major Tyler Gibson said Gaskin has addressed issues regarding “Measure S,” a bond proposition authorizing funds to improve campus facilities.</p>\n<p>“In 2014, we tried to improve [SBCC’s] infrastructure,” Gibson said. “[Gaskin] addressed concerns because of Measure S. We’ve tried to strategize ways to continue to be an effective community campus while keeping the faculty and students in mind.”</p>\n<p>Gibson said many students were surprised about Gaskin’s announcement.</p>\n<p>“Most people that I’ve talked to said ‘No way,’ ‘Wait when? Next year? Didn’t she just get here?’” Gibson said. “She’s somebody I look up to, so it was very shocking to see her announcing about retiring.”</p>\n<p>Gaskin said one of the defining moments in her career as president was the events of May 23 last year in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If there was one moment that has been set apart from all the others, it is the tragic loss of lives in Isla Vista,” Gaskin said. “It is the antithesis of what anyone wants from our students. Learning and teaching is a truly special endeavor, and for something like that to happen is an assault to the core of who we are.”<br>\nGaskin said she hopes to travel after her retirement.</p>\n<p>“I want to have the time to travel,” Gaskin said. “I’ve never taken a trip in the 35 years in September or October. It would be so unusual to travel then.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/sbcc-president-to-retire-after-four-year-service/","id":4636,"author":{"id":134,"name":"Neil Yanga"},"related":[4635,4634,4633],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/134"}},"__N_SSG":true}
