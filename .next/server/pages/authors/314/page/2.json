Santa Barbara never looked back as it kept the lead for the remainder of the game.</p>\n<p>Later in the first quarter freshman attacker Natalie Selin doubled the lead for UCSB.</p>\n<p>With over a minute left in the first quarter, the Matadors scored their first goal of the game to make it 2-1 heading into the second quarter of action.</p>\n<p>Two and a half minutes into the second quarter, senior attacker Brenna Thomas brought the lead back to two goals after the Gauchos took advantage of a Matador exclusion.</p>\n<p>Just before the half with only 21 seconds remaining, senior utility Taylor Shore scored her first of four goals in the game. The score was 4-2 at halftime in favor of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB continued to control the game as they outscored CSUN 7-4 in the second half.</p>\n<p>Snyder opened the scoring for the Gauchos in the third quarter followed by goals from Shore and Thomas.</p>\n<p>At the 5:33 mark in the fourth quarter the Matadors fought back to make it 7-5. From that point on, UCSB cemented the victory by going on a 4-1 run to close the game.</p>\n<p>In that run, Shore added two more goals to her total to give her four on the game, Snyder threw in another for her hat trick and freshman center Samantha Rosenberg also scored.</p>\n<p>That win meant UCSB would automatically finish inside the top eight for the tournament.</p>\n<p>The next opponent was No. 6 Michigan, who they faced at the Winter Invitational earlier in the season in a tough defensive battle. The Gauchos were looking for revenge in this one, as they fell 7-4 last time out against the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>The first quarter was one to forget for Santa Barbara as they uncharacteristically found themselves down 4-0.</p>\n<p>“It was too big of a hole that we dug ourselves under,” Head Coach Serela Kay said. “In a game like that where the rest of the game each team is only scoring one goal per quarter, you can’t go down by four.”</p>\n<p>Selin managed to slip a goal in right before the halftime buzzer with 23 seconds remaining to give UCSB a 5-1 lead at halftime.</p>\n<p>Excluding the poor first quarter, the Gauchos were only outscored 3-2 through the final three quarters of the game. With a 7-2 defeat to the Wolverines, UCSB was looking ahead to their next opponent in San Diego State.</p>\n<p>San Diego State was coming off a blowout loss to USC, so they too were looking to bounce back. The winner of this matchup reserved a spot in the fifth-place game later that afternoon.</p>\n<p>Trailing 1-0 in the middle of the first quarter, Thomas of UCSB scored her third goal of the weekend to begin the scoring for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter sophomore utility Sarah Kreiser and senior utility Jenna Solberg scored, resulting in a close 3-2 advantage at halftime over SDSU.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter the Gauchos poured in three unanswered goals from sophomore utility Kate Pipkin, Kreiser and redshirt junior utility Miranda Schrader to give them a 6-3 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>Just 20 seconds into the fourth quarter, Kreiser finished off her hat trick to extend the lead. The final period included goals from Pipkin on a penalty and Snyder, giving UCSB the victory 9-6.</p>\n<p>Several hours later, Santa Barbara faced the Aggies of UC Davis in the fifth-place game at the Triton Invitational.</p>\n<p>UCSB fell behind 2-0 in the first quarter with 2:56 remaining. 30 seconds later, Shore got the Gauchos on the board with her first of three goals in the game.</p>\n<p>UC Davis responded with a goal of their own and closed the half with a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos returned the favor in the second frame, battling back to even the score with goals from Pipkin, Shore and freshman utility Abbey Grosse. It was anyone’s game with the score at 4-4 heading into the halftime break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came away from the third quarter with a 6-5 lead as Kreiser and senior defender Sophie Trabucco lifted the Gauchos ahead of the Aggies.</p>\n<p>Shore struck early in the fourth period followed by Kreiser’s goal three minutes later, which increased the count to 8-5 with 4:12 remaining in the game.</p>\n<p>At the 1:12 mark, the Aggies began to claw back, reducing the deficit to two goals. With 55 seconds left, UC Davis scored again as the comeback looked more and more possible.</p>\n<p>However, it was not enough. UCSB held on the take fifth place at the Triton Invitational. This result was another step in the right direction for this young Gaucho squad.</p>\n<p>“Things are starting to fall into place,” Kay said. “There were a few moments throughout the weekend that the games could’ve gone either way, and we held on and came out with the win.”</p>\n<p>The defense of UCSB showed up yet again throughout this tournament, holding opponents to just 6.5 goals per game in their three wins and one loss.</p>\n<p>“Before every game … our focus is to come out and defense first,” said Kay. “I think the team really bought into that.”</p>\n<p>Freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder had 42 saves for the tournament, including 27 on Sunday as she continues to anchor the defense for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Kenzi Snyder is doing a great job in the cage for us,” Kay said. “She’s a freshman and she’s really stepped into that role right away, and I’m proud of where she’s at.”</p>\n<p>As things start clicking as the Gauchos get closer to Big West conference play, every game seems like a positive growing experience for this young team.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the weekend with every game, because we are a young team, was to learn to play with each other a little bit more,” Kay said. “I think that definitely showed throughout the weekend. We’re a different team leaving after the fourth game than before we arrived.”</p>\n<p>After getting this upcoming weekend off, UCSB will head down to Irvine to participate in the UC Irvine Invitational beginning on Feb. 24.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75682\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75682\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-13/womens-water-polo-nearly-completes-sweep-at-triton-invite/","id":4927,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4926,4925,4924],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 9 UCSB Prepared for Triton Invitational After Week of Rest","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winless through one match on the road thus far, the UCSB women's water polo team will look to change its away game status this weekend at the Triton Invitational.

Since 2011, the Matadors have only beaten the Gauchos three times in 12 matchups.</p>\n<p>“They return all of their starters from last year, so they’re a little bit older of a team,” Kay said. “It’s important that we come out and focus on the defensive end to start, and everything from there will come.”</p>\n<p>The stout defense of UCSB will have to deal with CSUN junior attacker Katelyn Fairchild who has scored a team-high 23 goals this season in just 10 games. This is a Gaucho defense that held the Matadors to only four goals in both matchups last season. It will be a clash of youth and experience on Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Following their matchup versus CSUN, UCSB will play in a rematch against either the No. 7 Wolverines or No. 23 Marist, who it faced during the Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was defeated by Michigan that weekend 7-4, so there is an opportunity to get even after being handed its first loss of the season by the Wolverines.</p>\n<p>“Excited about the possibility of facing either of those teams again,” Kay said. “We played [Michigan] tough the first time around.”</p>\n<p>The youth of the UCSB roster has been a work in progress this year. However, against great competition, they have been able to put together impressive results.</p>\n<p>“Every game that we play we’re learning something new about ourselves as a team,” Kay said. “The freshmen are getting better and better.”</p>\n<p>With all the freshmen on the team, the more experienced players have an expanded role in guiding the newcomers. Kay recently had an important conversation with seniors Sophie Trabucco and Jenna Solberg about this season and about their important roles.</p>\n<p>“Both [Trabucco and Solberg] have a big defensive presence for our team; they’re both very competitive and tough,” Kay said. “You can’t do it without players like that. It was really special to be able to share publicly how important that sort of player is.”</p>\n<p>UCSB is ready to get back in the pool for some more competitive action as they look to continue to improve their chemistry.</p>\n<p>“This weekend, the main objective is to learn how to play together a little bit more and start putting the pieces together,” Kay said. “It’ll be fun once we get a few more games under our belts and things will start clicking.”</p>\n<p>Last season, Santa Barbara finished in eighth place at the Triton Invitational out of 16 teams. This confident bunch is ready to improve upon that result in this year’s event with the help of the young, great freshmen and the reliable seniors.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Cal State Northridge Saturday at 12:30 p.m. in their first match at the Triton Invitational in La Jolla.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 9, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75575\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75575\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/no-9-ucsb-prepared-for-triton-invitational-after-week-of-rest/","id":4926,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4925,4924,4923],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Outlast Wagner, Fall to Arizona State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_11-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In its first road trip of the season, the UCSB women's water polo split its pair of matchup at the ASU Invitational.

The Gauchos matched their season high for goals in a quarter with six as they outscored the Seahawks 6-3 in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>Over a minute into the second quarter, senior utility Taylor Shore threw in her first goal of the day to bring the Gauchos within one. Watson responded by netting her hat trick to bring the lead back to two goals for Wagner.</p>\n<p>UCSB then went on a 3-0 scoring run to take their first lead of the afternoon at 5-4. Redshirt freshman attacker Shannon Moran began the scoring run followed by goals from Shore and freshman utility Sarah Snyder who continued her tremendous goal scoring run.</p>\n<p>Snyder finished the game with four goals which adds to her team high total of 15 goals on the season. The freshman also contributed with two assists this game and is the only gaucho to score in every game up to this point.</p>\n<p>Wagner added two more goals to their total as they took the lead once again, but UCSB returned the favor with two goals scored by Snyder and freshman attacker Natalie Selin ending the half on top 7-6.</p>\n<p>“Wagner came out battling and I give them a lot of credit,” UCSB Head Coach Serela Kay said. “They never backed down the whole game.”</p>\n<p>It took over half of the third quarter to get the first goal of the half. After that Seahawks equalizer, the Gauchos finished the quarter off with two goals in quick succession.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara extended their unanswered goal scoring streak to four when they scored the first two goals of the fourth quarter. At this point the Gauchos had a cushioned 11-7 advantage with just 5:35 to go.</p>\n<p>After conceding three straight goals, including two over the final 1:29, the Gauchos held on for what turned out to be a nail-biting victory in the end.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a little out of control on our defensive end and even offensively just taking care of the ball,” Kay said. “We found a way to win, we found a way to hold on.”</p>\n<p>Aside from some mistakes in this game, the defense was solid yet again just like it has been all year for the Gauchos. They have only allowed over eight goals in two games this season. If you exclude the blowout loss to USC, the Gauchos have only conceded about 6.7 goal per game.</p>\n<p>The freshman goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who had nine saves versus Wagner, has been a big part of the defensive success.</p>\n<p>“Kenzi Snyder holds down the cage for us and she has a high game IQ,” Kay said. “She has not only a physical presence but also a presence vocally in the cage and I think that makes a big difference for us.”</p>\n<p>Next up were the hosts Arizona State who came into the meeting with a 2-0 record having won their first two games of the Invitational.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils began the scoring at the 5:02 mark in the first quarter. In the ensuing possession, Shore assisted Selin for her second goal of the weekend to even the score at 1-1.</p>\n<p>Two minutes into the second period, freshman utility Kate Coski chalked up her fourth score of the season. At 2-1 this turned out to be the first and only lead for the Gauchos in this one.</p>\n<p>The hosts levelled 15 seconds later and then took the lead with under two minutes remaining in the half.</p>\n<p>As the half was winding down, Trabucco equalized with her first of two goals in the game. The half came to an end all even at 3-3 in Tempe, Ariz.</p>\n<p>“I was happy about the way that we competed right from the start,” Kay said. “Anytime you you’re playing a team 1-1 in the first quarter and then 3-3 at half that says that you’re playing solid defense and both teams are battling.”</p>\n<p>ASU turned it on the third quarter with four goals while not conceding any at the other end of the pool. UCSB was even with Arizona State in every quarter except the third which ended up costing them the game.</p>\n<p>“We made some poor choices offensively that led to goals for them that set up their offense,” Kay said. “We’re young and the season is early so it’s important at this point that we learn from that third quarter. I think it’s important when things get a little out of our control that we learn to be resilient.”</p>\n<p>The final score was 8-4 as ASU finished off their undefeated weekend. Santa Barbara ended the invitational splitting their two games in Tempe.</p>\n<p>Kay was very pleased with what this young team was able to do on their first road trip against a couple of strong sides. However, with the youth comes some natural obstacles to get around.</p>\n<p>“We need to focus on the details,” Kay said. “We need to realize that it’s the little things that make big things

Ariz. to participate in the Arizona State Invitational against two top-25 nationally ranked teams for its first road test of the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will face No. 21 Wagner and the invite’s host in No. 5 Arizona State this weekend. Both opponents will be playing in season-opening matches, and the Gauchos can only hope their heavy slate to begin the year will be to their advantage despite a short time span for recovery.</p>\n<p>“I knew that six games in three days were a lot to ask for the team to compete at such a high level at the very beginning of the season. It was intended to be that way,” Head Coach Serela Kay said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Saturday will commence the Arizona State Invitational for UCSB when it faces Wagner. Notably, both programs have been on an upward trend in recent years.</p>\n<p>However, just like UCSB, Wagner lost some key players who contributed to all of its winnings in recent years. Three of their top five goal scorers in program history graduated last spring. That record-setting core of players led the team to three straight MAAC Tournament Championships.</p>\n<p>Even with the departure of several players, the Seahawks are still not as young as the Gauchos, who consist of eight freshmen and one transfer.</p>\n<p>“Fifty percent of our team is new, but it’s the beginning of the season,” Kay said. “The positive thing is that I think we will be competitive against anybody, so I’m excited about that.”</p>\n<p>Both teams are still trying to find the right mixture of players and play styles. However, UCSB has a slight edge with the momentum it gained from its four victories.</p>\n<p>Wagner is led by three juniors — attacker Elise Begg, utility Kimberly Watson and attacker Lacey Anderson — who all contributed over 55 goals a season ago, ranking them just behind the former three-headed scoring core of seniors who shattered various records.</p>\n<p>Wagner and UCSB have only faced off twice in the past; both meetings were in the last two years. The Gauchos won both games by the scores of 10-6 and 5-3.</p>\n<p>Sunday will provide a tougher matchup versus Arizona State. Scoring against the Sun Devils’ defense will be no easy task as the unit is led by star redshirt junior Mia Rycraw inside the goal cage.</p>\n<p>Rycraw finished last season as a Second-Team All-American goalie with 318 saves, which was first in the conference and third in Arizona State single-season history.</p>\n<p>She is joined by a terrific sophomore attacker from Assendelft, Netherlands, Maud Koopman. Koopman led the Sun Devils in points last season as a freshman with 35 goals.</p>\n<p>The Sun Devils have been living in the shadows of MPSF powerhouses USC, Stanford, and UCLA, who routinely compete for National Championships. The current polls have Arizona State only behind Cal, UCLA, USC and Stanford, who are all in the MPSF conference.</p>\n<p>Arizona State finished the 2016 season with a 10-1 home record. UCSB was just 1-4 on the road last year.</p>\n<p>ASU has beaten UCSB once in each of the last five seasons by an average margin of victory of nearly four goals.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will once again see where they’re at after the two games this weekend. For now, this team is still trying to figure some things out.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t played anybody else besides ourselves before [last] weekend,” Kay said. “Playing other teams really shows what we need to work on and also what we’re good at. I’m looking forward to getting back to work this week.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Wagner at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 28 and Arizona State at 1 p.m. the following day, Jan. 29.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of January 26, 2017’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/no-9-ucsb-encounters-first-road-test-at-asu-invitational/","id":4924,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4923,4922,4921],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Winter Invite 4-2, Fall to Juggernauts No. 2 USC & No. 8 Michigan","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_WWaterpolo_4-9-16_12-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Opening this season at home at Campus Pool hosting the UCSB Winter Invitational, the No. 9 UCSB women's water polo team concluded the weekend with a solid first impression despite two losses.

The first half ended with UCSB on top 4-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put on a beautiful display of attacking in the third quarter. They outscored Cal Baptist 6-2 in the period to give them what appeared to be a comfortable 10-5 lead heading into the fourth.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist exploded with three goals in the first three minutes of the final quarter. However, freshman utility Sarah Snyder responded by netting her third and fourth goals of the game for the Gauchos. UCSB earned their first win of the season in their Winter Invitational debut 13-8.</p>\n<p>Later that Friday afternoon, UCSB went up against Indiana in a top-15 battle. UCSB was first on the board thanks to senior captain Taylor Shore. Moments later, Snyder scored her fifth total goal of the day. Indiana returned the favor with two goals of their own to end the first quarter at two goals apiece.</p>\n<p>The second quarter passed in the same fashion as the Gauchos scored the first two goals before the Hoosiers answered with a pair of goals to tie it up.</p>\n<p>That was the last of Indiana’s scoring for the game, because UCSB didn’t concede a goal for the entire second half. Sophomore utility and former Hoosier Kate Pipkin scored two goals in the second half against her former team.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the day with an 8-4 victory, looking confident for the games ahead.</p>\n<p>Day two of the Winter Invitational brought better weather and provided a tougher opponent in No. 8 Michigan. This was a defensive battle from the start. The first quarter came to a close with the score of 1-1 in an even matchup.</p>\n<p>The second quarter began with a quick goal from the Gauchos when freshman utility Abbey Grosse gave a nifty lob pass over the defender to Taylor Shore, who slotted it home for the goal.</p>\n<p>With about two minutes left in the half, the Wolverines scored to even it up at 2-2. The Gauchos went on to earn a power play with less than 30 seconds remaining in the half as head coach Serela Kay called a timeout. The ensuing play led to Shore finding the prolific Snyder for the goal to take the lead at 3-2.</p>\n<p>Michigan quickly responded with a lob shot attempt that landed on the line of the goal as the buzzer sounded, resulting in a no goal call from the referees.</p>\n<p>Michigan threw in three goals in the third as they began to pull away. UCSB found themselves down 4-5 heading into the final period.</p>\n<p>The Wolverine defense stepped up in the fourth period, making it difficult for the Gaucho attack time and time again. UCSB was unable to score in the quarter and was defeated 4-7.</p>\n<p>“The Michigan game really sticks out in my mind because we controlled the game all the way until the fourth quarter,” said Kay. “We’re young, so the fourth quarter moments and game situation moments are really important for us.”</p>\n<p>About an hour later, UCSB had to jump back in the pool for another game as they faced off against the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens. The Gauchos dominated from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Freshman attacker Natalie Selin scored a first quarter hat-trick as the Gauchos led 5-1 at the end of the opening quarter.</p>\n<p>Early in the third quarter, Shore earned another hat-trick as UCSB went up 9-3. Pomona-Pitzer added a couple more goals to their tally, but UCSB eventually earned their third win of the weekend by the score of 15-5.</p>\n<p>The final day of the Winter Invite was layered with heavy rain and constant winds when UCSB squared off versus Marist, which scored double digit goals in its first two games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos stayed with their defensive theme in this game, holding the Red Foxes to only two goals in the first half. UCSB’s balanced attack resulted in seven goals to make it 7-2 at the break.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to make it difficult for Marist, which could only total five goals in the entire contest. Snyder and Shore stayed on their terrific goal-scoring pace, each scoring in the third quarter.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos finished off the Red Foxes by the score of 11-5 to earn their fourth victory of the weekend.</p>\n<p>As the rain slowly died down, UCSB took the pool against powerhouse No. 2 USC in the final game of the 2017 Winter Invitational. USC came into the game with an average margin of victory of over 11 goals in their previous four games at the Winter Invite.</p>\n<p>The Trojans continued their goal-scoring frenzy, pouring in seven goals in the first period of play. The Gauchos struggled to get anything together as they trailed 2-12 at the half.</p>\n<p>Snyder, Selin, Trabucco and senior attacker Brenna Thomas scored the Gauchos five goals in the game. USC never took its foot off the gas, winning 19-5 to give it an undefeated record for the weekend.</p>\n<p>Despite the tough loss to close out their host event, the Gauchos felt good about their performances throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy with where we’re at,” Kay said. “I’m actually happy that the weather came in and was windy and stormy; I think it gave us something that we’re really not used to so I think it’ll make us stronger in the end.”</p>\n<p>Shore and Snyder led the team in goals with 11 each. The standout freshman Snyder was very productive over the weekend in her first action with the team.</p>\n<p>“She [Snyder] can play on the outside and on the inside,” Kay said. “She was scoring on power plays, on the perimeter and in front of the cage. She’s a scorer. She’s a finisher. She has no fear.”</p>\n<p>Next weekend, UCSB will make the trip to Tempe, Ariz., home of Arizona State, to take part in the Arizona State Invitational.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75099\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75099\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-23/ucsb-ends-winter-invite-4-2-fall-to-juggernauts-no-2-usc-no-8michigan/","id":4923,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4922,4921,4920],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Winter Invitational to Begin New Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WWaterPolo_vsUCSD-20160124-DustinHarris-9-web.jpg?resize=800%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 9 ranked UCSB women’s water polo team looks to continue its success of last season as it starts off the 2017 season at the annual UCSB Winter Invitational.

The Gauchos have seen a steady improvement each year during her tenure, bringing them into the national spotlight in the sport.</p>\n<p>“I think there’s a change in culture and change in mindset where the players and program show that they can beat anybody in the country,” Kay said. “We’re hosting and competing against some of the best in the country so in order to be the best you need to play the best”</p>\n<p>UCSB is ready to build off the tremendous success from a year ago, but this year the team will look a bit different, as it will be without four of its impact players from last year, all of whom have graduated. Three of its four highest goal scorers are no longer in the picture, making room for the talented core coming up.</p>\n<p>“We did graduate a good nucleus of the team this past year so we have nine new faces on the team,” Kay said. “Six seniors returning from that squad that won the Big West championship.”</p>\n<p>Senior utility Taylor Shore should help in that regard after scoring 46 goals last season while also leading the team in both steals and field blocks. She received a Big West honorable mention for her stellar season. She could be in for a breakout year with the extra opportunity available.</p>\n<p>“Looking at Taylor Shore who is our captain,” Kay said. “She’s really crafty and is a really smart player.”</p>\n<p>Shore is joined by returning players like redshirt junior utility Miranda Schrader, senior defender Sophie Trabucco, and senior attacker Brenna Thomas. Schrader was second in goals last year among players who are returning this year. Each of them played all 33 games last year and have plenty of experience to carry on the winning mentality in the program.</p>\n<p>The Big West conference is loaded with talent, with every team somewhere in the top-25 national rankings. UCSB is currently the third-highest ranked Big West school behind only UC Irvine and Hawaii. Four of the Big West schools will be participating in the UCSB Winter Invitational.</p>\n<p>UCSB hosts No. 22 Cal Baptist this Friday at 12:00 p.m. at Campus Pool. At 4:40 p.m. the Gauchos will return to Campus Pool to face the Indiana Hoosiers. On Saturday, UCSB will face No. 8 Michigan at 12:30 p.m. and Pomona-Pitzer at 2:50 p.m., both at Campus Pool. On Sunday, UCSB will play Marist at 10:30 a.m. and will close out the Winter Invitational against No. 2 USC at 4:10 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74992\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74992\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-20/gauchos-host-winter-invitational-to-begin-new-season/","id":4920,"author":{"id":314,"name":"Tommy Pardini"},"related":[4919,4918,4917],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/314"}},"__N_SSG":true}
