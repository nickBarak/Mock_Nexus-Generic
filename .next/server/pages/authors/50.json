Wellness in an effort to create a singular directory for students, who previously had to go to multiple websites to learn about the full range of resources available at UCSB, according to Sharleen O’Brien, director of Health &amp; Wellness and co-chair of the Mental Health Task Force.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The site features subpages including Urgent Needs and Basic Needs, as well as links to prominent campus wellness organizations such as Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) and Student Health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Urgent Needs section provides quick access to resources such as the UC Police Department, financial emergency assistance and sexual assault advocacy, while the Basic Needs section informs students on resources such as campus food banks, affordable housing and budgeting strategies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website also has a brief summary of every listed wellness organization on campus and  the services each organization offers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The website is also a statement to students that we highly value supporting the well-being of our students for their quality of life, but also as integral to their success at UC Santa Barbara and beyond,” O’Brien said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to O’Brien, the Mental Health Task Force collaborated with a variety of campus groups to ensure the website was comprehensive, including the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Student Health Services, Alcohol &amp; Drug Programs, C.A.P.S., Health &amp; Wellness, C.A.R.E., Student Mental Health Coordination Services, Disabled Students Programs, Career Services, Housing, the Educational Opportunity Program, the Graduate Division and the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Taskforce</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Angela Andrade, director of the Student Mental Health Services Coordination, also met with Associated Students (A.S.) President Alison Sir and Adalis Rojas from the A.S. Public Health &amp; Mental Health Commission to discuss key features of the site, such as links to critical resources and contact information for campus services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website is located on the UCSB homepage, under Campus Experience and Health and Wellness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to O’Brien, the website is still a work in progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We expect to continue growing this site with student feedback to ensure that it is maximally useful for students,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mental Health Task Force will be publicizing the website’s creation over the next few months and will be discussing it with the UCSB community at the A.S. Mental Health Town Hall at Corwin Pavilion on Jan. 31 from 3 to 5 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [Jan. 22, 4:46 p.m.]: This article previously stated the A.S.

The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">panel was made up of leaders from Food and Water Action, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mixteco/Indígena Community Organizing Project (MICOP), the Community Environmental Council (CEC) and Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy (CAUSE). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the groups are members of the C3JN and are specialists on specific local economic and social climate concerns; C3JN</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a group that has been working together for two years to achieve more transactional climate action. Ana Rosa Rizo-Centino, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">senior Central Coast organizer for Food and Water Action, said that C3JN is a blueprint for what other areas can be doing to best address climate challenges. It focuses on how whole community involvement produces the most effective results. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After making presentations about their organizations, community climate leaders opened up the floor to take questions from the audience and discuss community climate concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening centered around the importance of community collaboration to achieve a Green New Deal suited to the Central Coast; Vanessa Terán, policy and communications associate for MICOP, emphasized that “it’s going to take all of us to build the movement that we want to see and the change we want to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent Montecito mudslides and Thomas Fire, which devastated areas of Santa Barbara County, were big topics of discussion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These events put our work in greater perspective,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sigrid Wright, the CEO and executive director for the CEC said</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, referencing working on climate policies in the face of natural disasters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Pellow, director of the environmental studies department at UCSB, said the Green New Deal will look different for various solutions depending on areas’ geographic and economic dynamics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the Santa Barbara area, this involves reducing emissions, creating sustainable local jobs and revolutionizing transportation systems, according to Pellow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wright added that the close proximity of Santa Barbara’s highways and train systems to the ocean makes them particularly vulnerable to climate effects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Much of our critical infrastructure is at risk,” Wright said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron Gray, transportation and climate manager for the CEC, further explained that “40% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation systems.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that greenhouse gas emissions need to be decreased in order to significantly reduce climate change; in the Santa Barbara area, this would mean changing the number of electric cars, moving jobs closer to where people live and improving public transportation to reduce congestion along Highway 101.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students were curious about how they could take action themselves. Representatives from the student group, Eco Vista, asked for hands-on suggestions on how to make Isla Vista more green. Alice O’Connor, director of the Blum Center, recommended community gardens and locally sourced goods as a place to start. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel also emphasized the need for the Green New Deal to be intersectional and inclusive of all groups, regardless of income or race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Climate justice requires rebirth of institutions which have been historically and to this day predominantly white,” Maricela Morales, executive director of CAUSE, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruby Layman, a first-year environmental studies major at UCSB, attended the forum to get more involved in local sustainability initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to see as much environmental action as possible so I figured going to forums and getting involved is the best way to do that,” Layman said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The people closest to the problems are closest to the solutions,” Terán added.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90999\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/green-new-deal-forum-proposes-climate-change-solutions-for-santa-barbara/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90999\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/green-new-deal-forum-proposes-climate-change-solutions-for-santa-barbara/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/green-new-deal-forum-proposes-climate-change-solutions-for-santa-barbara/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/green-new-deal-forum-proposes-climate-change-solutions-for-santa-barbara/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-03/green-new-deal-forum-proposes-climate-change-solutions-for-santa-barbara/","id":1940,"author":{"id":50,"name":"Amelia Buckley"},"related":[1939,1938,1937],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/50"}},"__N_SSG":true}
