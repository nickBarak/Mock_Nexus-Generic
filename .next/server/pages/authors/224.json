This year, that time was cut down by a month.</p>\n<p>Besides preparation issues, Bishop said that conflicting fundraising relief aid for the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides was another factor in the drop in donations.</p>\n<p>Although he hadn’t cross-checked KCSB’s donor list, he guessed that the previous contributors were providing more towards relief efforts.</p>\n<p>“Some people weren’t really comfortable donating to us when there’s other causes for direct relief,” he said.</p>\n<p>The radio station’s event faced another roadblock with the adoption of a last-minute advertising pitch to contribute 10 percent of every $1,000 dollars collected by KCSB to the Direct Relief organization assisting in aid for areas affected by the fires and Montecito mudslides.</p>\n<p>This pledge required KCSB to tiptoe over university warnings and get an official invoice from Direct Relief in order to fulfill that promise.</p>\n<p>According to Bishop, “The university didn’t want us to act as agents of [Direct Relief]. We can’t say we’re ‘donating’ 10 percent. We have to say we’re contributing to them, but not on their behalf.”</p>\n<p>Despite conflict and delays, the radio station continued the fund drive that consisted of 24-hour radio shows that asked listeners to donate. They also offered listeners “thank you gifts” like vinyl records, concert tickets and others.</p>\n<p>KCSB also sponsored festival events in downtown Santa Barbara and hosted an open-mic night fundraiser in Goleta.</p>\n<p>After contributing 10 percent of every $1,000 raised to the Direct Relief organization, the remaining funds will be used to pay for special projects and community events throughout the year that are sponsored by KCSB Radio.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges, Bishop is satisfied with everything he and his team put together.</p>\n<p>“In the grand scheme of things, 23k is pretty good and I’m really proud of everyone I’m working with, especially given the circumstances,” he said.</p>\n<p>While the official fundraiser has ended, online donations will still be collected until March 16, through PayPal and Network for Good.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of the story stated KCSB would donate “10 percent to the Direct Relief organization.” The station will donate 10 percent of every $1,000 raised. The story also stated Bishop referred to KCSB’s 2017 donor list and “contested” that the donors were now putting money toward relief efforts. Bishop said he hadn’t cross-checked the donors between this year and last and he only “guessed” that the donors were contributing money elsewhere.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/kcsb/","id":2763,"author":{"id":224,"name":"Spencer Sween"},"related":[2762,2761,2760],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Is It Cool to Juul?

According to the California College and <a href=\"http://cyanonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CA-College-SmokeTobacco-Free-Report-Card-2016.pdf\">University Smoke/Tobacco-Free Policy Report Card</a>, secondhand “e-cigarette aerosol is a new source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ultrafine/fine particles.”</p>\n<p>Studies from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the UC Office of the President reveal that around 16 percent of the college-age population and 8 percent of University of California students vape or handle similar nicotine products. The Report Card also says that in Calif., young adults are three times as likely to use e-cigarettes than adults over 30.</p>\n<p>Devices like JUUL, PHIX and similar models are among the most common e-cig products in use among students.</p>\n<p>According to the Report Card, UC Santa Barbara is 100 percent smoke and tobacco free, including e-cigarettes. Despite this, UCSB has not escaped this new fad, and these devices “are a rising concern for UCSB,” according to UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program.</p>\n<p>The CDC and the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department warn that these products can hurt the respiratory system “just like traditional cigarette smoke can,” and the addictive properties of the chemical make it just as harmful for psychological health.</p>\n<p>Madison Barnes, a tobacco cessation educator at UCSB, explained that the consequences of vaping are normally not taken into consideration by users.</p>\n<p>“Vaping and e-cigarettes are a rising concern for UCSB as many students believe they are a healthier alternative to smoking cigarettes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSB actively works towards limiting use and providing various resources to get addicted students off these products.</p>\n<p>One of these resources is the Alcohol and Drug Program, which offers support services to students that include free addiction cessation products and psychological advising in order to help afflicted students.</p>\n<p>But even with the seeming decline of traditional smoking use and the ongoing efforts of UCSB’s administration to limit other forms of nicotine consumption, major challenges still remain to halt addiction across the student population.</p>\n<p>One student, who asked to remain anonymous due to housing regulations, explained that the dissipating smell of the vape and the strength of the nicotine makes it an ideal illegal substance in small areas like the dorms.</p>\n<p>However, because of the high nicotine concentration in the devices, vapes can make users extremely susceptible to addiction.</p>\n<p>Nik Babourine, first-year mathematics major, said he has met students in the Santa Catalina halls “that can’t even stay focused in group study sessions because they need to leave to get their Juul.”</p>\n<p>Michael Takahara from UCSB’s Smoke and Tobacco Free steering committee explained that efforts to keep students from consuming nicotine will counter efforts of companies that supply these products.</p>\n<p>“New ways of delivering nicotine to the body will continue to evolve as the Tobacco Industry works at creating new life long customers,” Takahara said in an email.</p>\n<p>As newer methods and trends of nicotine consumption rise, UCSB’s various support services and policymakers “will continue to learn about them and address them” for the foreseeable future, Takahara said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the March 1, 2018 issue of the

of coastline and thoroughly cook recreationally caught seafood. <em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The various coliforms and bacteria measured have remained at staggering levels above state standards. As of Monday, Goleta Beach has fecal coliform levels that are 150 percent over state standards and enterococcus levels at over 10,000 percent. Fecal coliform and enterococcus are types of bacteria.</p>\n<p>While eight beaches were closed initially, only Carpinteria State Beach, Goleta Beach and Hammond’s Beach remain closed.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Department warns against going into affected waters, citing high levels of bacteria which could indicate that other disease-causing bacteria are present.</p>\n<p>The department will continue to conduct testing on Goleta Beach and other areas, but for now it recommends remaining 400 feet away from beach areas where mud transports are temporarily deposited. The buffer zone is marked by orange fencing.</p>\n<p>Elevated levels of bacteria in ocean water were first seen after Santa Barbara County began moving mud from Highway 101 to local beaches.</p>\n<p>Mud and soil runoff from the storms following the Thomas Fire in early December were collected and then transported by county flood control officials to make room for road repairs. Goleta Beach was selected as a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/mud-from-landslides-moved-to-goleta-beach-tested-for-safety/\">temporary storage site</a> for this policy.</p>\n<p>The mud dumping largely contributed to the rise in contaminant levels along surrounding areas due to the “unknown amounts of untreated sewage and possible chemical contaminants in the water and sand,” said Susan Klein-Rothschild, deputy director of Santa Barbara’s Public Health Department.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Public Health Department issued a release warning the public to “refrain from eating recreationally raw fish and shellfish where levels of bacteria highly exceed standards.” Individuals should cook “recreationally caught” seafood before consuming it, the department said in the release.</p>\n<p>Goleta Beach is one of the areas cited in the release.</p>\n<p>Campus Point remains open due to acceptable water conditions, county officials said, as coliform levels are stable and only enterococcus bacteria exists in the water. These conditions, however, could fluctuate for as long as mud is being brought to Goleta Beach.</p>\n<p>“Bacteria concentrations at Campus Point will likely be a function of currents and winds that bring the sediment plume from Goleta Beach to Campus Point,” explained Jenna Driscoll, an associate for Santa Barbara Channelkeeper.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Channelkeeper is conducting water soil tests for <em>E.Coli</em>, fecal coliform and other biological contaminants that could seriously affect beachgoers at these locations.</p>\n<p>The Public Health Department is also testing the water. Updated data can be found on the Public Health Department and SBCK websites.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the Feb. 1 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Jenna Driscoll’s name was mistakingly written as “Jenny,” due to an editing error. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80738\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80738\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/beaches-still-closed-due-to-mud-runoff/","id":4344,"author":{"id":224,"name":"Spencer Sween"},"related":[4343,4342,4341],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/224"}},"__N_SSG":true}
