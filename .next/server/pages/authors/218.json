The council also voted down a resolution condemning a racially themed party organized by a UC Irvine fraternity last November.</p>\n<p>Finance Board chair Katie Lieberknecht said the board slashed next year’s budget from $672,496 to $400,695 in order to accommodate three new advisors and one part-time position.</p>\n<p>According to Lieberknecht, if every Boards, Committees and Commissions’ budget was fully allocated next year, finance board would be left with a $300,000 deficit in its unallocated fund.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that A.S. does not have money — because it does — but we need to account for the growth of positions because we are still receiving the same amount of money,” Lieberknecht said.</p>\n<p>Lieberknecht said the budget should signify the association’s priorities.</p>\n<p>“Cuts are inevitable at every level of the budget process,” Lieberknecht said. “We had to make cuts, the president is going to have to make cuts and [Leg Council] is going to have to make cuts.”</p>\n<p>The budget is currently under review by A.S. President Paul Monge-Rodriguez and will be made public within the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lieberknecht said BCCs have been breaking the A.S. Constitution by funding Office of Student Life groups’ travel expenses and over $500 for food without administering one-time exceptions.</p>\n<p>“When BCCs are funding OSL groups there is a lot of policy-breaking and it’s usually not caught until it gets to admin and it’s already passed through minutes and Leg Council,” Lieberknecht said.</p>\n<p>Alfredo Del Cid, university-owned housing representative, suggested developing a uniform process for requesting finances.</p>\n<p>“I think it would help if there was a streamlined process for funding,” Del Cid said. “I’ve been to multiple committee meetings and some have you give a form to the treasurer and some just bring it up in meetings.”</p>\n<p>The council decided not to condemn the actions of Irvine’s Phi Kappa Psi that held a Pilgrims and Indians -themed party last year.</p>\n<p>Del Cid, who authored the resolution, said the UCI administration still hasn’t taken action against the frat.</p>\n<p>“This is not an attack on the fraternity, but on the action,” Del Cid said. “We’re not telling them what to do, but that we stand in solidarity.”</p>\n<p>However, Yeni Nguyen, off-campus representative, said the council has no reason to target this specific party.</p>\n<p>After the resolution failed, Off-Campus Representative Amanda Berry said future resolutions should address all parties of this nature.</p>\n<p>“If we’re going to take a stand on this, then take a stand and make it general that ‘We don’t support any parties that do this’ instead of ‘We don’t support this particular party that had this specific theme,’” Berry said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33972\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33972\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-24/discusses-budget-upcoming-year/","id":3156,"author":{"id":218,"name":"Ashley Jensen"},"related":[3155,3154,3153],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

They also talked about problems within the council maintaining healthy attendance at meetings.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jones, A.S. associate director for community affairs, said the Isla Vista Community Collaborative — composed of parents, teachers and groups that tackle issues facing local children of kindergarten age and older — conducted extensive research revealing that local children don’t have access to nutritious food.</p>\n<p>“The collaborative did a survey on access to healthy food and the results were eye-opening,” Jones said. “There are zero supermarkets, no farmer’s markets, three small markets — one of which is called Keg-N-Bottle — and 19 fast food outlets.”</p>\n<p>However, Jones said the sustainable café with local, organic and free trade food that A.S. plans to open next school year on Pardall Road could provide families in I.V. with healthier food options.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Alfredo Del Cid, on the other hand, said low-income families won’t be able to afford food served at an organic eatery.</p>\n<p>“When we talked about the restaurant, every time I hear organic and healthy then comes the conversation of it being more expensive,” Del Cid said. “It’s easier for me to go and get two tacos for $0.99 than to buy an organic meal. I would like to have a conversation about this because Dan [La Berge] who drafted the plan did say it would be more expensive and I want to talk about how we can make it more affordable for these families.”\tAdditionally, the council discussed the transportation dilemma for local families who cannot afford automobiles face.</p>\n<p>Off-Campus Representative Tiffany Mayville said Environmental Affairs Board could potentially offer free bicycles that would provide low-income families easier access to supermarkets in Goleta and Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Last year EAB set up a special auction with [the Community Service Organization] and bought bikes and then taught families how to fix them up and then gave them the bikes,” Mayville said. “CSO impounds thousands of bikes that are just abandoned every year on campus so we should do something with them.”</p>\n<p>Jones also said youths growing up in I.V. are often negatively influenced by college students’ lifestyles.</p>\n<p>“The living style in I.V. is an issue too,” Jones said. “There are very young youths developing substance abuse problems because they are drinking what is left in bottles that they pick up for recycling with families.”</p>\n<p>The board also debated at length problems facing the council, including members’ poor attendance and inattentiveness during public comment sessions.</p>\n<p>Del Cid said he couldn’t remember a single meeting that was attended by all elected representatives.</p>\n<p>“I understand that things happen and sometimes people can’t make it to meetings,” Del Cid said. “It says in our bylaws though that after school, this is our first priority. So be accountable; we’re not kids.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-33557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-33557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-02-17/seeks-healthy-iv-living/","id":3157,"author":{"id":218,"name":"Ashley Jensen"},"related":[3156,3155,3154],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Potential Policy Change Spurs Council Debate","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Associated Students Legislative Council discussed at length a bill to modify the upcoming spring A.S. elections during last night’s four-hour meeting.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students Legislative Council discussed at length a bill to modify the upcoming spring A.S. elections during last night’s four-hour meeting.</p>\n<p>Council members debated the logistics of the bill, including vague wording in the resolution, its committee membership requirements and endorsement policy. The board ultimately tabled the measure until next week’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President of Internal Affairs Jake Elwood said it’s crucial for the council to reach a decision by their next meeting.</p>\n<p>“The deadline to make changes to this year’s elections committee is week five [of winter quarter],” Elwood said. “If we do not vote by then, the changes will be made for next year.”</p>\n<p>However, Representative at Large Chloe Stryker said she couldn’t support the bill as written because of its lack of clarity. Stryker said its vague language could potentially violate the A.S. Legal Code’s bylaws.</p>\n<p>“There are a lot of things in this bill that I think are a Judicial Council hearing waiting to happen,” Stryker said.</p>\n<p>The board also discussed the resolution’s proposed candidate endorsement procedure. As specified in the bill, if a current elected officer endorses a candidate for the 2011-2012 academic year, the officer will be penalized and lose pay, among other consequences.</p>\n<p>“For endorsements, I don’t think that you should be using your position to endorse a candidate,” Stryker said. “But does that mean that an officer cannot post ‘vote for this person’ on their Facebook without losing their honoraria and having to pay back tuition?”</p>\n<p>Additionally, Off-Campus Representative Stanley Tzankov said the endorsement clause of the bill does not specify what constitutes “official support” for a candidate.</p>\n<p>“I hope that we can get some clarification from the elections committee,” Tzankov said.</p>\n<p>Representative at Large Miles Freeman, on the other hand, said he supported the bill because the electoral process is in dire need of change.</p>\n<p>“I know this is a complicated bill,” Freeman said. “This was a bill essentially drafted, created and compiled by the elections committee and I think we should rely on the elections committee to make this decision.”</p>\n<p>However, On-Campus Representative Alfredo del Cid said the council must first discuss the matter with the elections committee before making a decision.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-32382\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-32382\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-27/potential-policy-change-spurs-council-debate/","id":3151,"author":{"id":218,"name":"Ashley Jensen"},"related":[3150,3149,3148],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/218"}},"__N_SSG":true}
