The Saint Mary’s Gaels will head into Caesar Uyesaka Stadium with a solid 4-2 record.

Thoreson is so far this season hitting an outstanding .400 with two home runs and has a slugging percentage of .760. In the series against the Washington Huskies, Thoreson went 9/17 (.529 Avg.) with a home run, five runs scored and three RBI.</p>\n<p>Another big bat to look out for Tuesday is Gael third baseman Charles Zaloumis. Zaloumis is the team leader in both average (.471) and RBI (7), but he does not hit in the typical spot for someone with team-leading offensive numbers.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gael third baseman has been hitting eighth in the line-up for the Gaels and, interestingly enough, has been producing in that eighth spot. There may be a possibility that Saint Mary’s Head Coach Eric Valenzuela will move Zaloumis in the line-up, but as the saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”</p>\n<p>The expected starters for Tuesday’s matchup are UCSB’s sophomore RHP Noah Davis (2-0) and Saint Mary’s senior RHP Cameron Neff (0-0). Last time out, Gaucho ace Davis was spectacular against the Tulane Green Wave, going seven innings, striking out 10 and giving up only two earned runs while earning his second win of the season.</p>\n<p>Neff’s last outing was a completely different story, as Neff went five innings, giving up four earned runs off nine hits against the Huskies. With the Gauchos collecting 35 hits and scoring 27 runs this past weekend, it will be very interesting to see how Neff and the rest of the Saint Mary’s pitching staff will fare against the surging Gaucho offense.</p>\n<p>Continuing with the now very dangerous Gaucho offense, three bats awoke for the Gauchos against Tulane, who will be key factors heading into Tuesday’s contest. The senior outfielder and DH Billy Fredrick had a huge series against the Green Wave, hitting .714 (5 for 7) with four runs and five RBI. Redshirt junior third baseman Kenny Corey also had himself a great few games, going 5 for 9 (.556) with three runs and three RBI.</p>\n<p>However, the most important bat this weekend was that of junior first baseman Austin Bush. Bush, who headed into the Tulane series one for his last 15, found his swing, hitting .545 (6 for 11) with one home run and four RBI. If the lefty can continue his opposite-field approach into Tuesday’s game, Bush will to continue to find good barrel on the ball.</p>\n<p>Junior left fielder Colton Burns also continues to rip the ball for the Gauchos, hitting .476 this season. Burns, who also had himself a series against Tulane (5 for 8, 7 runs), will be a problem for the Gaels if he continues to get on base. Through 31 plate appearances, the junior transfer from College of Canyons has a mind-blowing on-base percentage of .645 and scored a team-leading eight times this season. Paired with his .667 slugging percent, Burns is a very early leader for team MVP.</p>\n<p>After a comeback ninth-inning walk-off win Sunday afternoon to get the sweep against Tulane, the Gauchos have all the momentum in the world for the Saint Mary’s matchup. Still, this one game appearance by the Saint Mary’s Gaels will prove to be yet another test for the Gauchos.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76031\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76031\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-27/after-weekend-sweep-gauchos-look-ahead-to-saint-marys/","id":4142,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

In the publication, Geivett’s advice is not only applicable to those who seek a career in sports management, but to anyone competing in any type of job market today as well.</p>\n<p>Geivett played for the Gauchos in 1984 and 1985 and posted monster numbers while in a UCSB uniform. Geivett still holds the school records for career batting average (.402), single season batting average (.412, 1985), hits in a season (100, 1985). He also used to hold records for triples in a season (8, 1985), most runs scored in a season (74, 1985), and most at-bats in a single season (243, 1985).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After previously being drafted four consecutive times by four different organizations, Geivett finally signed with then Anaheim Angels organization in 1985 after being drafted in the 13th round.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Geivett, his baseball-playing career would come to a sudden conclusion due to a knee injury in 1988, but this career ending injury still would not stop Geivett from being a part of baseball. Soon after, Geivett would coach for Loyola Marymount University in 1989 and Long Beach State University in 1990.</p>\n<p>While coaching for college programs added to his already impressive baseball resume, Geivett’s future would still lie in professional baseball with him eventually becoming a scout and instructor in the Yankees organization in 1991.</p>\n<p>From 1994 to 1996, Geivett would be hired as the head farm director for the Montreal Expos. The Expos’ farm system was largely known as one of the best farm systems in baseball during this time due to the tremendous talent in the system that housed big names such as Mark Grudzielanek, Orlando Cabrera, Jose Vidro, Cliff Floyd and Vladimir Guerrero.</p>\n<p>During his time as a farm director, in his book, Geivett recalls an experience he had with a particular player, F.P. Santangelo.</p>\n<p>Jeff Blair from the <em>Montreal Gazette</em> published an article with an inside major league source from the Expos’ organization, stating, “We don’t feel there is anyone in Ottawa [Montreal’s Triple-A affiliate] who can help our team in Montreal.”</p>\n<p>This angered many Ottawa Lynx players, but no more so than it angered Santangelo. After a team meeting, most players had cooled down — but not Santangelo. Santangelo would confront Geivett and insist he is ready to be called up to the big leagues, even though Santangelo was hitting a less than impressive .243 at the time.</p>\n<p>After a roster spot opened up on the big league squad due to an injury, Geivett would take a risk on Santangelo, sending him to the big leagues after Santangelo waited seven years in the minors. Stating he went above several people’s heads in the organization to do this in his memoir, Geivett’s career was on the line with this decision.</p>\n<p>Nervous, Geivett’s worst fear would come true and Santangelo’s name would be penciled in the lineup the first day he arrived in Montreal. Putting all his money on Santangelo, a person who was more confident in his ability than anyone, Geivett would come out on top.</p>\n<p>Santangelo would go on to hit a triple that night and would end up staying in the big leagues for seven years. Geivett stated in his book himself, “It was one of my most emotional experiences in professional baseball watching F.P. slide into third base … F.P. Santangelo taught me the power of confidence.”</p>\n<p>After his time in Montreal, Geivett would become the assistant general manager of the Devil Rays in 1997 and would move on to join the Dodgers in 1998 under the same position.</p>\n<p>While with the Dodgers, Geivett shared another story about college graduates looking for work in professional baseball. At the Baseball Winter Meetings, an event where baseball GMs meet and discuss potential trades, a couple college graduates approached Geivett and Tommy Lasorda with their resumes trying to get hired on the spot for jobs within the organization. Right then and there, both Geivett and Lasorda broke down the flaws in each approach the men had … to their faces.</p>\n<p>When asked about this story when speaking as a special guest for a sports management course here at UCSB, Geivett assured the class to do these three specific things that are reinforced and expanded upon in his book: “Have a specialty. Really know what you’re talking about. Make people aware what you want to do.”</p>\n<p>In 2000, Geivett would land and stick with the Colorado Rockies organization for 14 years, moving from director of player personnel to director of minor league operations to assistant general manager to the team’s director of major-league operations in 2012. After a long career in baseball, Geivett would later resign from this position in 2014.</p>\n<p>Geivett hopes the release of his book will both help and inspire generations of sports managers and people alike, stating, “I’m hopeful that in years to come somebody that reads the book remembers, ‘Hey I remember reading the book and that guy talked about that,’ and the lesson has been passed on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76006\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76006\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-26/professional-baseball-lifer-and-former-gaucho-bill-geivett-opens-up/","id":1898,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.

To lead off the game, short-stop and Preseason All-American Clay Fisher would hit a bomb over the left field fence in the Gauchos’ first at bat of the season. In one swing of the bat, Fisher would be the first person in Division I Baseball in 2017 to get a hit, hit a home run, drive in a run, and collect an RBI.</p>\n<p>Later in the top of the fourth, still ahead 1-0 from Fisher’s lead off homerun, Colton Burns would crush a ball over the right field fence, extending the Gauchos lead 2-0. Burns, a junior college transfer from College of Canyons, is coming off a monster sophomore year where he hit .406 with 30 RBI’s and 4 homeruns.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, starting pitcher Noah Davis was busy silencing non-believers who thought UCSB would not have enough pitching depth or a true ace after the departure of Shane Bieber. Davis would absolutely shove, giving up only one run and striking out four in six innings pitched.</p>\n<p>From here, the Fish Show would continue. Fisher would go 2-for-4 finishing with one run and three RBIs for the Gauchos. After some well executed sac flies from J.J. Muno (0-3, 1 RBI) and Thomas Rowan (1-2, 1 RBI), Alex Garcia would come in and get his first save of the season (1 hit, 2 strikeouts). The Gauchos and Davis would get their first W of the season with a final score of 6-3 over the Lions.</p>\n<p>The second game, played on Saturday, featured a pitcher’s duel between UCSB’s Kyle Nelson/Steven Ledesma and LMU’s Brenton Arriaga.  The lefty Kyle Nelson was also selected for Preseason All-American honors, coming off a stellar sophomore year having a record of 7-2 with a 2.18 ERA and 10 saves.</p>\n<p>The starting pitcher Nelson would pitch well, but had a short leash going only going four innings, giving up one run off five hits. The one run from Nelson would come from LMU’s Billy Wilson who singled, got bunted over to second base, stole third base and reached home on an infield play.</p>\n<p>Nelson, a former closer, threw a total of 54 pitches. Expect Nelson to gradually go deeper into games as he becomes more comfortable with his starting pitching role.</p>\n<p>Right-hander Steven Ledesma, a junior college transfer from Santa Barbara City College, came in to relieve Nelson.  Ledesma would make a case of his own as a potential starter going four innings, allowing three hits, no runs, with four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Although the Chos’ pitched extremely well, game two was all about LMU Senior Brenton Arriaga.  The lefty, who had all 4 of his pitches at his command, would go the distance striking out 9 batters while shutting out the Gauchos. The Gaucho’s would collect only 3 hits in 9 innings, 2 by Fisher (2-4, 2B) and one by Michael McAdoo (1-3). The Gauchos would lose a tough one by a 1-0 score.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the rubber match of the series would continue with Gaucho offensive woes. Through nine innings, the Gauchos mustered up only two runs off four hits, two of the four hits coming from left fielder Colton Burns (2-4).  On the other side of the diamond, the Lions tee’d off on the Gauchos’ pitching.</p>\n<p>In an offensive explosion lead by LMU second baseman Phil Caulfield (4-5, 3 Runs, 1 RBI), the Lions would go on to score 8 runs (6 earned) on 9 hits. UCSB’s starting pitcher, Joe Record, would get the loss only going 3.2 innings while giving up 4 runs (3 earned) off 4 hits. The Gaucho’s would lose the rubber match and the series by a score of 8-2.</p>\n<p>“I think everyone’s a little bit frustrated. You know, I don’t think we play the way we wanted to play,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We weren’t sharp defensively, got it handed to us a little bit offensively, so I think the positive to it is it’s a wake up call.  We got work to do.”</p>\n<p>While not the start the Gauchos envisioned, there are still 53 games left on the schedule to prove to everyone if they belong. UCSB will be back in action Tuesday, Feb. 21 at CSU Bakersfield for a 6 p.m. start.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-21/stormy-weekend-rains-on-gauchos-opening-series-parade-finish-1-2-at-lmu/","id":4209,"author":{"id":315,"name":"F.P.
