The most avid Extravaganza fans were greeted in their earliness with the indie groove of garage rock band Twin Peaks. The Chicago-based musicians proved to be a vitalizing first act in a production-heavy lineup. The band was followed by L.A. artist Thundercat’s unrivaled blend of funk, soul and everything in between.</p>\n<p>Concertgoers sized up the converted Harder Stadium with glazed looks.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by a river of concession stands and administrative tents and shadowed by A.S.-sanctioned monuments, the centerpiece of the Extravaganza field was a Camp Flog Gnaw<em>–</em>esque wooden signpost. The sculpture was adorned with signs naming each of Extravaganza’s artists, pointed in every possible direction.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The madness was soon joined by a low rumble.

Silence rippled through Harder Stadium.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78106\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1686027685\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78106\" data-attachment-id=\"78106\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3664-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3664\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-78106 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3664-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Heralded by the furious pounding of her drummer’s set, Tinashe made her Extravaganza debut clad in an iconic military fatigue cap and backed by four dancers. The singer thanked UCSB profusely over an ocean of anxious noise before beginning with a rendition of her Schoolboy collab, “2 On.”</p>\n<p>SB was easily enthralled by the pop star’s performance. The force of her stage presence introduced an energy unlike anything UCSB’s concert scene has provided in the past year: the playful, in-your-face excitement of pop-diva stardom. All of her typical hits, including “Superlove,” “Flame” and “Company,” as well as songs off her 2016 studio album, <em>Nightride</em>, made appearances in Tinashe’s set. Longtime fans found no disappointment, while those unfamiliar with her work found enthusiasm in the vivacity of her act.</p>\n<p>Through her performance, Tinashe best connected with the crowd in a moment toward the end of her set. The line between the scheduled songs and the encore had blurred beyond haze-filled recognition, while the blaring brightness and scorch of the day drowned the better part of the crowd’s concentration. Tinashe finally paused. The singer visibly caught her breath as she addressed the crowd with “a special song, one close to my heart,” a song meant for all those who “understand why I’m here.” Channeling the anticipation felt in waiting on a lover, the performer had the crowd transfixed at the song’s opening line.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78107\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1361077705\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78107\" data-attachment-id=\"78107\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_2599/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_2599\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78107\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2599.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78107\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Tinashe at last completed her marathon, finishing her final song with a noticeable pant. She waved goodbye with a radiant smile, which electrically pulsated throughout the crowd. As her drummer’s no-holds-barred solo ushered her offstage, the pop star shouted one last thank-you to UCSB. With one last blown kiss, the once ecstatic stadium reverted to its strange liminal state of void noise.</p>\n<p>Tasked with picking up the quieted slack, Michigan-born electronica artist GRiZ snuck onstage to surprise the growing mass of college students. Reminiscent of RL Grime’s intensity, GRiZ’s set was much better suited for the outdoor air of UCSB’s signature nonchalant attitude. He recaptured the enthusiasm of the somewhat fizzled concert, becoming a stunning success from relative obscurity. GRiZ opened his set with some festive, chill swells. However, he quickly ascended into liveliness, invigorating Extravaganza with jazzy beats.</p>\n<p>GRiZ was accompanied onstage by his brass-playing companion, a trumpeter recalling the funky live sets of Big Gigantic. The Michigan performer himself wielded an impressive tenor sax. Yet the two musicians’ onstage vivacity was subdued by the striking quality of GRiZ’s visuals: a series of abstract animations reported to be of the artist’s own production. Images included a silhouetted head opening to release swirling streamers of color. Many were amazed by the unexpected detail of the set and the passionate simplicity of GRiZ’s performance. The duo brought an infusion of authentic excitement to a genre so unfamiliar with live instrumental performance.</p>\n<p>“The trumpet was <em>really</em> good,” screamed bubbly first-year Marissa Erese, “probably my favorite part.”</p>\n<p>GRiZ’s set offered some original work as well as mixes of well-received pop culture classics. The EDM artist raised Harder with a brass-infused performance of The Isley Brothers’ “Shout.” The chant of the song’s iconic lyrics resounded even when GRiZ turned the chorus momentarily off.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78108\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1767386801\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78108\" data-attachment-id=\"78108\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3035-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3035\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78108\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3035-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78108\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Again, the rush of sound and energy followed the performer off the stage. The babble of the crowd returned as concertgoers staked their claim on the floor or saddled for the arduous voyage to Harder’s rear in search of water. A stream of dead-eyed Extravaganzees could be seen clutching complementary water bottles as they queued at the cluster of administrative tents.</p>\n<p>Back onstage, in the heated haze of the festival’s waning hours, an enthusiastic, not entirely out-of-place twentysomething strode to the stage’s front.</p>\n<p>“Y’all need more energy before I can let Schoolboy come out here,” he taunted, priming the Extravaganza crowd for their headliner.</p>\n<p>Schoolboy Q entered Isla Vista with much anticipation. Sizing up the crowd with his characteristically smirky grin, Q yelled Extravaganza to life. Accusations of UCSB’s lacking level of energy prompted a fanatic series of screams from his audience.</p>\n<p>Extravaganza was only realized at the sound of the jingling opening of “Collard Greens.” The crowd chanted unanimously alongside the heavily panting rapper as a chasm of mosh enveloped the field’s center. Schoolboy ran through the list of his classic hits including “Studio” and “Break the Bank,” carried by the weight of his status as rap kingpin. The characteristic sharpness of his post-gangsta rap, South Central attitude shone in the casual nature of his crowd-mocking. Though rarely melodic, with discombobulated verses and a heavy dependence on freestyle, Schoolboy managed to provide a cohesive performance. The rapper’s set played well to Extravaganza’s atmosphere (contrary to the performer’s original beliefs), a release of scholastic pressure for a Sunday afternoon rush of music, raging and sweaty bodies. However, Schoolboy did incite some of his back-home, Flog-Gnaw rawness with the enormous mosh pit that slowly developed in the center of the field.</p>\n<p>Q paused to taunt the crowd, demanding everyone unready for part two of his performance, “Go back to your dorm rooms.” The rapper took his challenge a step further by denigrating the supposed lack of UCSB energy. “They were better at UCSD,” smirked the rapper. This served only to reinvigorate the crowd through chants of <em>olé, olé, olé, olé</em>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78109\" style=\"width: 1375px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1140110231\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78104\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78109\" data-attachment-id=\"78109\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/img_3354-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1365,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3354\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78109\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=888%2C1332\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1332\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3354-1.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Schoolboy finished with a performance of Kendrick’s “M.A.A.D.

Succumbing to the chants of “one more song,” Schoolboy riled the crowd with an improvised rendition of his most anticipated song, “THat Part.” Despite insistent cries from the audience, Schoolboy left the Extravaganza stage as he had found it, with no want for enthusiasm. The mass of concertgoers slid to the exits with the Santa Barbara sunset materializing over their exhausted heads.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78104\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78104\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-24/extravaganza-17-rocks-the-masses/","id":6685,"author":{"id":699,"name":"Daniel Gitlin"},"related":[6684,6683,6682],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Delirium 2016: UCStillBrazy","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-3.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Questions about the reputation of UCSB’s legendary legacy have underscored the anxiety surrounding the extensive security measures.

However, the enthusiasm toward the annual Delirium concert has come to replace this lost spirit of Halloween, and Delirium has become a benchmark of the UCSB legacy. In the words of UCSB undergrad Clare Doyle, “music brings people together, especially big names like YG … it’s cool that UCSB throws concerts like this. Kids really appreciate it.”</p>\n<p>Taking into consideration the length of last year’s entrance line, eager Gauchos began lining up for the concert around 4 p.m., four-and-a-half hours before the concert was due to begin. Heightened security at the entrance initiated a wave of fears about the ticket exchange. However, excitement in anticipation of the performance was nowhere near subdued, and hundreds of anxious undergraduates began clogging the underground pathway leading to the Rec Cen fields.</p>\n<p>Concert attendees trickled timidly into the Thunderdome under a heavy security presence. But once inside, the atmosphere changed; the anticipation for Flatbush Zombies compounding the waves of excited heat produced by the pulsing mass of concertgoers. The stream of entering students diverged into two paths, one seeking relative safety in the partially extended bleachers on either side of the main stage, the other merging straight into the throbbing heart of the concert’s ground floor.</p>\n<p>As the stadium grew increasingly packed and excitement grew exponentially higher, everyone began to wonder when Flatbush was set to perform. A full half-hour passed in waiting for the opening act, yet the evaporating energy of anticipation became displaced, manifesting in the body-heaving fray created by Flatbush’s performance. Interventions by stage security, which were primarily to save raving concertgoers from being trampled, couldn’t dissuade the movement and flow.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73689\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"339560544\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73689\" data-attachment-id=\"73689\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/meganmineiro_delirium-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=350%2C467&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,467\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"meganmineiro_delirium-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73689\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MeganMineiro_Delirium-2-e1478135420558.jpg?resize=350%2C467\" alt=\"Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"467\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Megan Mineiro / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>The throng excluded no classic Halloween character, but some concertgoers’ costumes were lost in the sweaty haze permeating the dance floor. To one freshman, Marlena, the green spotlights radiating from the stage as well as the smell “made the experience”.</p>\n<p>The Zombies began with some of their more well-known hits, but, ever off the beaten path, refused to stay structured, instead choosing to freestyle while performing on-stage acrobatics. The Zombies’ shirts disappeared at the onset of the show, and Gauchos center-stage received a hearty surprise when one of the trio wormed his way to the stage through the crowd.</p>\n<p>During Flatbush’s peak, two stage-wide mosh pits sprung up at the demand of Flatbush frontman Meechy Darko, who refused to continue performing without a “real mosh pit.” The pit soon devolved into rave-like chaos, with Darko interrupting the performance to address the crowd on numerous occasions. His interludes challenged the Gauchos to reanimate a yearning Halloween spirit and were answered with deafening roars by the pulsating mass of proud and primed UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Before performing their outro, “Palm Trees,” Flatbush halted their performance so that a glassy-eyed and drenched Darko could command UCSB to “forget everything else we said tonight; if we leave you with one message, it’s this: O<em>pen your f***ing minds”.</em></p>\n<p>But the main course was still yet to come, following another half-hour of waiting. YG’s act succeeded Flatbush with a crowd-hyping session by his crew’s DJ. Gauchos were taunted with an instrumental intro that brought on YG’s companion rapper.</p>\n<p>A surge buckled the crowd as 400 stepped onstage after another instrumental intro. YG began his act with performances of classic YG hype hits “Still Brazy,” “Left, Right” and “Toot It and Boot It.” A fiercely responsive SB answered with a new wave of mosh pits and crowd turbulence.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73684\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"99159227\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73684\" data-attachment-id=\"73684\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-02/delirium-2016-ucstillbrazy/img_2142/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=2000%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"img_2142\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73684\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=350%2C263\" alt=\"Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2142.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frankie Horne / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Around the middle of the concert, YG brought his performance to a halt, addressing the SB crowd with “Y’all UCSB, right? Lot of Latinos in SB. I love Latinos.” A brief speech about Latinos spawned an anti-Donald Trump tangent met with great support from YG’s famously anti-Trump fanbase.</p>\n<p>YG attempted to quell a coming rant on the candidate by stating, “I’ll save that for the end of the show… in the meantime, I brought a friend with me.” YG then introduced East Santa Barbara native Sad Boy Loko as his guest rapper. While garnering limited recognition in the crowd, Sad Boy Loko regained the enthusiasm of YG previous performance by joining YG in singing some of the duo’s hits.</p>\n<p>After Sad Boy left, YG resumed the concert with a riled performance of “Bitch, Who Do You Love,” another of his most successful and more recent songs<em>. </em>YG periodically interrupted the performance by addressing the Gaucho audience, asking girls to “speak Ghetto” for him and to perform other tasks in tandem with the concert’s atmosphere. YG also included a crowd-hyping interruption to throw some of his personal merchandise into the audience. The rapper and his crew then electrified the students with an extremely well-received performance of “Don’t Tell ’Em,”  his collaboration with artist Jeremiah, going so far as to freestyle from Kendrick Lamar’s <em>Good Kid, M.A.A.D City</em>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73683\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a

concert, YG revived the Donald Trump rant he had refrained from performing earlier, espousing to the Gauchos that, “a racist is running for office right now, a man who hates black people.” Following more commentary, he asked, “so who y’all voting for?” and delved into his infamous track “F*ck Donald Trump” to roars of “Hillary Clinton” and echoes of his catchphrase, “I like white people, but I don’t like you.” Following two more high-energy songs, YG was played out with the final words, “You great, Santa Barbara, look out for my mixtape dropping Friday.”  Right before walking off, YG concluded Delirium with the answer to his earlier question, settling all of the Gauchos’ Halloween unrest, “UC still brazy!”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

palpable as the intrepid first guests trickled into the spaciously small UCSB Art, Design, &amp; Architecture Museum, accosted by the grotesque and jagged faces of monsters from beyond the stars. Alien faces leered with eyeless sockets as patrons braved this bold new world, a chaotic and perhaps nightmarish universe conceived in the mind of an otherwise affable and unassuming genius.</p>\n<p>The architect of this madness is Michael Westmore, who stood, benevolently mild, to the left of the entrance in a corner surrounded by the cybernetic arms and blinking eyes of the hellish Borg. Walking among the gnarled faces of Cardassian soldiers and Klingon warriors, coexisting in lifeless harmony, an appreciation for the spatial complexity of the sculpting involved in the creation process dawns on the viewer.</p>\n<p>Foam latex molds and sketches of alien facial features adorned the walls of the exhibit. Full head casts of Sir Patrick Stewart, who played the levelheaded Captain Jean-Luc Picard in “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” rested beside a display detailing the drawing-board evolution of an alien nose.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Getting to “[see] how this stuff is made” became a near-overwhelming experience.</p>\n<p>Local Trekkie commitment was literally visible in the quantity of “Star Trek” themed apparel strolling through the exhibit, including a fully dressed Uhura. The line to speak with Westmore became saturated by avid fans yearning to convey their love of the show and its role in their development. Countless pictures were snapped with the man responsible for the foodstuffs of so many of their young imaginations.</p>\n<p>But the generational gap presented no problem, as young fans of both “Star Trek” and Westmore’s successful game show “Faceoff” also waited to converse with the familiar artist. A gaggle of freshmen with nominal connection to either “Star Trek” or Westmore’s other extensive works were giddy with admiration at meeting the man behind their favorite show, something that to them has become “a family experience.” Westmore released some good news: fans have another three seasons of “Faceoff” to which they can look forward.</p>\n<p>While Westmore’s legacy spans over 80 movies and television shows, encompassing the likes of “Rocky,” the “Munsters” and “Raging Bull,” his family’s work in the Hollywood makeup industry offers some of the most prolific contributions to the history of Hollywood.</p>\n<p>Beginning with Westmore’s grandfather George Westmore, who founded the first movie makeup studio in Hollywood, the Westmore family has been involved with movies as influential as “Gone With the Wind” and created creatures as notorious as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Creature From the Black Lagoon. The Westmore name is so ingrained into Hollywood that stars such as Elizabeth Taylor coddled Mr. Westmore as a child, while Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNiro became family friends.</p>\n<p>A UCSB alumnus, Westmore began his studies as a fine arts major, hoping to diverge from the movie-making sculpting that surrounded his childhood by becoming an educator. With heavy training in the arts, Westmore soon decided to pursue what he found to be his passion, art history, with the hopes of museum curation, archaeology or professorship.</p>\n<p>Invariably, he ended back in Hollywood for a movie production internship with his uncle, Bud Westmore. Finding a mentor in John Chambers, another of the most influential makeup artists in movie history, Mr. Westmore held fast to the profession of his forefathers, even becoming involved with the CIA in a project involving fake identities and disguises.</p>\n<p>The evening continued as the UCSB Pollock Theater presented a 20th anniversary screening of one of Westmore’s more famous Star Trek movies, “Star Trek: First Contact.” While the theater was not packed, a vibrant population of Trekkies arrived to show their support.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73120\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1840219882\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73156\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73120\" data-attachment-id=\"73120\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/mwestmore8-10-06-16-wemmons/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"mwestmore8-10-06-16-wemmons\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73120\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons-250x167.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"William Emmons / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MWestmore8.10.06.16.WEmmons.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73120\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">William Emmons / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>With a few opening words from Westmore and Pollock Theater director Matthew Ryan, the audience delved straight into the heat of a zero-g spaceship battle above Earth’s atmosphere. Enthralled in the voyage of the Enterprise E and her crew, UCSB students and locals alike were shown the complexity and otherworldly craftsmanship of the Westmores’ makeup work in creating both the cybernetic Borg menace and the Federation allies (the likes of Data the android and Warf the Klingon).</p>\n<p>As the credits rolled, a healthy ovation surrounded the appearance of Michael Westmore’s name.</p>\n<p>A small Q &amp; A session led by Ryan followed the film. Questions focused primarily on “First Contact” and Westmore’s more famous works, including his interactions with stars like DeNiro and Bette Davis. Though much was said of the business aspect of the art of movie makeup, Westmore did offer advice to aspiring artists, drawn from his personal experience as well as his role as a guide for artists navigating the modern industry on his show, “Faceoff.” “[In today’s world] you have to go to school, in order to be competitive and to know what you’re doing. The training offered in school is highly recommended.”</p>\n<p>Westmore touched on his training, which involved classical makeup (i.e. beauty work) and an emphasis in sculpting.</p>\n<p>Westmore’s exhibit, Lifeforms, is open until Dec. 4. The exhibit will reopen after a winter hiatus until April of 2017. Admission is free for UCSB students with valid ID.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73156\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73156\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/the-life-behind-lifeforms/","id":5846,"author":{"id":699,"name":"Daniel Gitlin"},"related":[5845,5844,5843],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/699"}},"__N_SSG":true}
