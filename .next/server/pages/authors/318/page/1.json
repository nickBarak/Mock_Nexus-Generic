Really, I am.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those people had to suffer through 52 years of brutal heartache and 147 seasons played in professional baseball, basketball, football and even hockey since winning their last title. Hell, the last time they won a trophy was when the Browns took the victory in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, two years before it became known as the Super Bowl. It was about time they have something to celebrate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And celebrate they have, after the Cavs, led by superstar LeBron James, won their first NBA title in NBA history. Riots in the streets; fights breaking out; people jumping up and down on cars, hanging on streetlights and lampposts, breaking bar windows, climbing responding fire engines and ambulances, stealing road signs and traffic cones, etc. etc. A lifetime of anguish for many Clevelanders was let loose in one night in a fit of terror on their own city. But, hey, they needed this.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a San Diego sports fan, I can relate.

Neither has won their current league’s title, with the Padres only appearing in the World Series twice, while the Chargers have appeared in only one Super Bowl. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Padres made it to the World Series in 1984 and 1998 and got destroyed both times. In their first appearance against Detroit, the Padres stood no chance, losing the series 4-1. Their second time around they did even worse as they were swept by the Yankees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chargers one appearance in the Super Bowl since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger was an absolute blowout as Steve Young, who threw for 325 and a still-NFL-record six touchdown passes, and the 49ers cruised to an easy 49-26 victory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three of these championship appearances are from either before I was born or at least before I can remember. But the strongest memories I do have about the two teams I’ve loved my whole life involve similar heartache in which I witness them get close to a chance at a title and then watch that opportunity wash away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most striking and lasting impression I have of my Chargers is from the 2006 season, when the team finished with the best record in the NFL at 14-2. They were the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and primed for Super Bowl contention led by stars such as Philip Rivers and Ladainian Tomlinson and looks forward to home field advantage secured throughout the playoffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite all the hype and excitement, they then collapsed in their first game of the postseason. A startling 24-21 loss to the New England Patriots in which they committed four turnovers, three of which led to Patriots scoring drives. Despite outgaining their opponent in rushing yards and total yards as well as intercepting opposing quarterback Tom Brady three times, the Chargers’ season was cut short in catastrophic fashion.</span></p>\n<p>Not to be outdone by their football counterpart, the Padres had a heartbreaking season of their own in 2010, a year in which they were predicted to finish last in the NL West but shocked the sports world by holding strong atop the division for most of the season.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71846\" style=\"width: 375px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71846\" data-attachment-id=\"71846\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-08/the-hard-life-of-a-san-diego-sports-fan/san-diego-padres-ballpark/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"645,340\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"san diego padres ballpark\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=250%2C132&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?fit=645%2C340&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-71846\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/san-diego-padres-ballpark.jpg?resize=365%2C192\" alt=\"Petco Park, the home of the San Diego Padres who have two world series appearances, both losses, in team history.

It would take a monumental collapse for the Padres to blow a chance at the postseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And that is exactly what happened. The Padres proceeded to lose ten straight games into the month of September, a historic collapse that left them clinging to the top of the division by a thread.</p>\n<p>After leading the NL West for 148 days of the season, the Padres officially relinquished a playoff spot for good to the Giants with a loss on the very last day of the season. San Francisco went on to win the World Series while the Padres went home and haven’t had a winning season since.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of these finishes left me reeling from a combination of grief and rage that lasted intensely for a minimum of weeks and then slowly worked into my overall emotional impression of San Diego pro sports. It’s memories like these that have left me cynical and demoralized regarding the topic, but not without hope.</span></p>\n<p>No, never without hope. The hope is what keeps me alive. Every new season without fail brings fresh dreams that maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that everything changes. Maybe, just maybe, this could be the year that America’s finest city captures its first-ever modern pro sports title.</p>\n<p>2016 probably isn’t that year. Seeing as the 2015-16 NFL season already concluded with the Chargers well out of playoff contention and the 2016 MLB season is about halfway done with the Padres mired in a sixth straight losing season, the title drought is almost assuredly extending to an extraordinary 54 years.=</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, hey, if Cleveland can finally get theirs, maybe our time is coming soon, too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or maybe not.</span></p>\n<p>Just give me one before I die, San Diego.

Along with Emde’s victory in the women’s high jump came victories in the women’s 1500m race, the men’s 800m race and the men’s javelin throw.</p>\n<p>Distance runners, specifically in the 1500m races, reigned supreme for the Gauchos this year. Three of the 12 UCSB regional qualifiers competed in this event at Kansas, including Victoria Tsolis, the Big West women’s track athlete of the year, and Shyan Vaziri, the Big West men’s track co-athlete of the year.</p>\n<p>Graduate student Tsolis became UCSB’s third female athlete ever to earn the accolade. The distance runner had a stellar season that included becoming the first Gaucho in school history to take the Big West title in the 1500m, running it in 4:20.53 at the finals in Long Beach.</p>\n<p>She also took third place in the 800m race at the conference meet with a time of 2:12.36. Earlier in the year, Tsolis set the school record in the 1500m with a run of 4:19.02, which was fast enough to be the Big West leading time and earn her Big West Track Athlete of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>On the other side of conference, Vaziri was Big West men’s track co-athlete of the year along with UC Irvine’s Lloyd Sicard.</p>\n<p>Vaziri is the second Gaucho distance runner to ever be awarded the honor. He finished just .58 behind the leader in the 1500m race at Big West Championships, with a time of 3:49.76, but took home the victory in the 800m with a run of 1:50.45.</p>\n<p>The last Big West title-winner for UCSB was junior javelin thrower Darion Williams, who took first place for the men with a throw of 63.53m.</p>\n<p>UCSB ended up sending a total of 12 athletes to the West Preliminary, with six coming from each of the men’s and women’s teams.</p>\n<p>Despite only Emde being able to advance to the final round, five different Gauchos ended up in the top-20 of their events. The other four were senior javelin thrower Melissa Rake, junior javelin thrower Matthew Kuskey, sophomore hammer thrower Jeremy Franklin and junior hurdler Myles Mcdonald.</p>\n<p>The team will look forward to the offseason now, developing their returnees and acclimating their new recruits, while keeping an eye on Emde and her efforts at NCAA Championships in Eugene, Ore. next weekend, June 8-11.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

He ended up finishing eighth in his heat and 32nd overall in his event with a time of 3:48.74, outside of the pool of qualifiers for nationals. This was disappointing considering the fact that he was ranked No. 9 in the West to start off the regionals.</p>\n<p>For the women, Tsolis came into the regional ranked at No. 15 in the 1500 but finished her heat with a 4:35.44 time that left her in the nine spot in her heat and the 40th spot overall.</p>\n<p>Also competing in the 1500 was junior George Baier, who finished 45th overall with a run of 3:56.01. He finished 12th in his heat.</p>\n<p>Three athletes represented UCSB in the javelin throw with two competitors on the men’s side and one on the women’s side.</p>\n<p>Senior Melissa Rake finished in 17th place in the women’s section with a toss of 47.56m for a fifth-place finish.</p>\n<p>For the men, junior Matthew Kuskey finished in 18th with a throw of 65.22m. He was fourth in his heat. Fellow junior Darion Williams was unable to record a qualifying toss.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the men’s team’s work were the performances of sophomore hammer thrower Jeremy Franklin and junior hurdler Myles McDonald.</p>\n<p>Franklin threw 61.69m to finish fifth in his heat and 15th overall in his event, just three spots away from qualifying for nationals.</p>\n<p>McDonald came close to qualifying but was unable to close it out. He ran a 51.86 second race in the 400m hurdles, finishing third in his heat and 18th overall.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho women’s team was completed by a couple freshman jumpers and a junior in the steeplechase.</p>\n<p>Freshman Alivia Schlueter jumped 11.59m in the triple jump, finishing 11th amongst her heat and 44th overall.</p>\n<p>Freshman pole vaulter Sierra Emrick leapt 3.82m to place 22nd in her heat and 44th overall.</p>\n<p>To round out the crowd, junior Maxine Goyette ran a 11:06.90 in the 3000m steeplechase to finish 15th in her heat and 43rd overall.</p>\n<p>Senior high jumper Emde will be competing in the NCAA Championships at Eugene, Oregon, next Wednesday through Saturday, June 8-11.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71545\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71545\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-30/gauchos-compete-hard-at-ncaa-west-regionals/","id":5702,"author":{"id":318,"name":"Duncan MacPhee"},"related":[5701,5700,5699],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos in Kansas for NCAA West Regional","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Track and Field","publish_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Track_4-2-16_11-web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Track_4-2-16_11-web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A total of 12 athletes will represent both the men's and women's sides for the UCSB track and field team in the NCAA West Regionals beginning Thursday, May 26 and ending Saturday, May 28.

Two of the Gauchos’ three highest individual event rankings appear in this race.</p>\n<p>Senior Shyan Vaziri is the highest seed of any UCSB athlete in each of their respective events at No. 9 in the men’s 1500 with an impressive qualifying time of 3:42.23. Assistant Coach Peter Van Beurden and the rest of the team/coaching staff are excited to see what he has in store for them this weekend.</p>\n<p>“I can really speak on Shyan’s behalf that his goal is to be there with the top guys and to make it all the way to the final rounds of nationals,” Van Beurden said. “I think he’s definitely going to be focused and confident heading into these rounds, and he has some experience too.”</p>\n<p>Vaziri is one of three total athletes that will represent Santa Barbara in the preliminary round of the 1500, including somewhat of a surprise qualifier in junior George Baier (3:45.56) in the No. 45 slot on the men’s side as well.</p>\n<p>The third Gaucho qualifier in the event is grad student Victoria Tsolis on the women’s side, who boasts a No. 15 ranking in her best event with a UCSB record qualifying time of 4:19.02.</p>\n<p>Both Tsolis and Vaziri have had their sights set on nationals all season long, and now that they are both just one step away, it’s become a much more realistic goal.</p>\n<p>“I think the best shot [might be with] Shyan and Tori, just because they have all that experience, that championship experience, and they kind of know how to run their race,” Van Beurden said. “They have that finishing kick that’s necessary to make it through the round.”</p>\n<p>Another athlete who has set herself up to have a great shot at the next round is senior high jumper Jessica Emde, who is looking to get to nationals for the first time in what will be her third regionals appearance. Emde is ranked highest of all the Gaucho women with a No. 14 seed that she earned with a qualifying leap of 1.79m in her event.</p>\n<p>“I think that she finally has the tools that she needs to survive a meet like this,” Assistant Coach Cody Fleming said.</p>\n<p>Other Gaucho athletes qualifying for this weekend include three javelin throwers: juniors Matthew Kuskey and Darion Williams for the men along with senior Melissa Rake for the women.</p>\n<p>“My ‘jav’ throwers are healthy, their approaches are on and as a javelin thrower, you can’t ask for anything more than that,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>The last two spots on the men’s qualifying group are filled by sophomore Jeremy Franklin in the hammer throw and junior Myles McDonald in the 400m hurdles.</p>\n<p>The women’s qualifying squad also includes junior Maxine Goyette in the 3,000m steeplechase, freshman Sierra Emrick in the Pole Vault and upstart freshman qualifier Alivia Schlueter in the triple jump.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Pete Dolan is excited to see what his athletes can do this weekend with the opportunity to put themselves in nationals.</p>\n<p>“Top 48 in the west, top 48 in the East. Nobody gets through on a pass, nobody gets a prior PR, it’s just like you’ve got to compete on that day [to] make it through,” Dolan explained. “That’s the coolest thing about the meet.

They only trailed the winner of the championship, UC Davis, who had a point total of 135.5.</p>\n<p>The men were led by star senior distance runner Shyan Vaziri, who came out on top in the 800m race and placed second in the 1500m. He finished the 800m with a time of 1:50.45 and the 1500m in 3:49.76.</p>\n<p>Freshman James Douglass and senior Andrew Farkas followed Vaziri in the 800m with times of 1:52.60 and 1:53.15, settling for sixth and eighth place respectively.</p>\n<p>In the 1500m, junior George Baier and senior Thomas Poston were right on the heels of Vaziri, finishing third and fourth, respectively, with times of 3:50.84 and 3:51.18. Senior Brad Littooy finished in seventh, in 3:51.64.</p>\n<p>Poston and Baier also finished back-to-back in another race, the 5,000m. Poston ran a 14:57.20 for fourth place while Baier ran a 14:58.95 for fifth.</p>\n<p>The pair were joined at the end by sophomore Patrick Bourke, who ran a 15:00.87 for sixth place right behind them.</p>\n<p>Baier also placed in the 3,000m steeplechase event. He ran a 9:10.88, good enough for third.</p>\n<p>In the longest event of the weekend, the 10,000m race, the Gaucho men had two finishers in the top six. Freshman Carlos Guijarro placed fifth in 30:50.74 and senior Anthony Ortolan placed sixth right behind him in 31:00.63.</p>\n<p>Hurdler Myles McDonald was able to put some points up on the board for the team with his fourth place performance in the 400m hurdles with a time of 52.29 seconds.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men notably had a very strong showing in the javelin throw on Saturday, taking three out of the top four spots. Junior Darion Williams came out on top with a throw of 63.53, and he was followed by junior Matthew Kuskey and freshman Wyatt Thompson-Siporen in third and fourth with tosses of 60.83m and 60.80m.</p>\n<p>On the women’s side, grad student and star distance runner Tori Tsolis had a huge impact on her team’s finish, as usual. She took the victory in the event she owns the UCSB record in, the 1500m race, as well as taking third place in the 800m run.</p>\n<p>In the 800m race, Tsolis finished in 2:12.36, and she was joined by sophomore Jade Fuller in sixth with a 2:14.90 and junior Kaitlin Large in seventh with a 2:16.16.</p>\n<p>Tsolis finished the 1500m race in 4:20.53 and was joined this time by sophomore Jenna Hinkle and freshman Sabrina Janes, who took fourth and fifth in 4:26.13 and 4:35.00.</p>\n<p>In non-running events, senior Jessica Emde helped the cause by taking first in the high jump with a leap of 1.79m, and freshman Alivia Schlueter did her part by finishing second in the triple jump with a jump of 12.51m.</p>\n<p>Senior Melissa Rake notably took third in the javelin throw with a heave of 45.93m.</p>\n<p>Select UCSB athletes who have qualified for NCAA regionals will be in action again this Thursday through Saturday, May 26-28 at the University of Kansas’ track.</p><div

track career in the blink of an eye, and has now come back just two years later to rewrite the Gauchos’ record books in her favorite event, the 1500m. And she’s not done yet.</p>\n<p>Tori came into the UCSB track program five years ago as the fastest recruit of her year with some very impressive credentials out of Presentation High School in San Jose.</p>\n<p>She was MVP of her high school squad all four years, and she ran the most competitive time of her Gaucho class at the California state finals her senior year, placing 13th in the 800m with a time of 2:12.82.</p>\n<p>When asked why she chose Santa Barbara, she immediately said “beach.” However, while the location of the school is undoubtedly a huge pull for recruits, for her, this was just one reason among countless others of why she chose to be a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“It was just a switch, like ‘I belong here.’ Everyone seemed really hardworking, and [it seemed like] an everyone’s-there-for-each-other kind of thing,” Tsolis said. “The day after my recruiting trip, I got home and I called [Head Coach] Pete [Dolan] and was like, ‘I want in.’”</p>\n<p>The star runner earned a scholarship eventually with her performance at state finals, but she still accepted less for the opportunity to study and compete at her dream school.</p>\n<p>“I could have gone to a different school and gotten a lot more money, but I just liked it here so much, and it’s paid off,” said Tsolis. “And I feel like I’m a pretty good recruiting investment, if you ask me.”</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that Head Coach Pete Dolan would agree on that point now, after all the success the two have enjoyed together. But this was not always so clear-cut.</p>\n<p>Before Tori even started her first year of school at UCSB, she got off to a rocky start. She came in and got injured in just the first couple weeks of cross country training over the summer before freshman year, forcing her out of cross competition that season.</p>\n<p>Then track season came around, and it didn’t go very well. She didn’t PR in the 800, and although she did have a PR in the 1500, she now knows that even that time was nowhere near her potential.</p>\n<p>As if her underperformance wasn’t discouraging enough, right before the conference finals, Tori suffered a back injury that prevented her from participating in the conference event and set her back for her sophomore year cross season as well.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the injuries continued as she endured a stress fracture, forcing her out of competition for the entirety of the season.</p>\n<p>“This was just a very low point in my running career here … I just didn’t even have to go to practice, and I was making all these new friends, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do it anymore,” Tsolis explained.</p>\n<p>As Tori started to get healthy again that summer, Dolan was getting frustrated with how things seemed to be turning out.</p>\n<p>“I’m thinking she’s just kind of becoming a rec runner. She can run [at this point], but she wasn’t really training, just running,” Dolan said.</p>\n<p>Eventually what got Tori back on track, both literally and figuratively, was some much-needed prodding from a friend and teammate who just graduated last year.</p>\n<p>“Her teammate, Dani Moreno gets the credit,” said Dolan. “Dani Moreno still believed in her and said, ‘If you still want to do this, you’ve got to get after it.’”</p>\n<p>Then, right before her junior year track season, Dolan told her with two weeks notice that she needed to do a two-mile time trial to stay on the team. To make things even more difficult, he gave her no target time to hit.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘You’ve just got to impress me, Tori. C’mon, you’ve got good credentials in high school. Just impress me.’”</p>\n<p>Tori trained as best she could, and with the help of Moreno pacing her at the start, she was able to run 11:06 to impress Dolan and keep her spot on the team.</p>\n<p>“That was the point when I was like, ‘OK, I can’t give up,’” said Tsolis. “That was when I was like, ‘If I do this well, I’m going to stay on the team and keep running, and if I don’t then I’m going to be done with my running career at UCSB.’”</p>\n<p>Since the time trial, Tori has been able to stay relatively healthy for the rest of her career while consistently pushing herself in her training.</p>\n<p>She began chipping away at her times as soon as she returned to the track her junior season, working hard to get back into it.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting her to run that fast ’cause it was her first real season back, [but] it got better and better and, most of the time, I was just shaking my head and going, ‘I can’t believe she’s running this fast,’” Dolan said.</p>\n<p>It all goes back to what Dolan said prior to the time trial: “Impress me.” Now, she impresses him all the time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70854\" style=\"width: 304px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1809397136\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70875\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70854\" data-attachment-id=\"70854\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/courtesy-of-tori-tsolis-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=1040%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1040,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Courtesy of Tori Tsolis\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=163%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?fit=666%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-70854\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=294%2C453\" alt=\"Courtesy of Tori Tsolis\" width=\"294\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?w=1040&amp;ssl=1 1040w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=163%2C250&amp;ssl=1 163w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=768%2C1182&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Track_ToriTsolis-IMG_3851-web.jpg?resize=666%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 666w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of Tori Tsolis</em></p></div>\n<p>Tsolis made it to the first round of regionals that junior year. Then in her senior year in 2015, she was able to advance to the second race of the first round, moving up to No. 2 on the UCSB all-time list in the 1500m in the process.</p>\n<p>This season, she finally broke the 11-year-old school record in the 1500m with a 4:19.02 at the Mt. Sac College Invite a few weekends ago.</p>\n<p>“I was ninth in my race, so I just stood there watching [the clock] go by each one. I’m like, ‘Come on, what did I run?’” Tsolis said. “And then I saw it, and I just tried to find my coach in the stands and I was like, ‘I did it!’”</p>\n<p>As the team works through postseason play now, Tori is looking to make it to nationals and become an All-American this year. She also hopes she can help her team to a top-three finish in the Big West Championships.</p>\n<p>“That’s where I’m looking right now,” said Tsolis. “It sounded ambitious going into the year, but now it’s more tangible, I think.”</p>\n<p>Dolan knows Tori is already in the upper echelon of athletes he has had the chance to coach, but if she reaches these goals, he knows she will forever cement her legacy at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“That last race at Mt. Sac (where she beat the UCSB record in the 1500), it was off the charts,” Dolan said. “My heart’s pumping, I’m going, ‘Wow, she’s doing it. She is right there with the best in the country.’ So I’m just staying with that.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Tsolis’ commitment has influenced one of the other two Toris on UCSB’s women’s team, junior decathlete Tori Usgaard, who says she has always looked up to the elder Tori for her mindset and work ethic.</p>\n<p>“Every time you see her work out, she’s always pushing herself to be front of the pack. I think that’s the biggest thing, that she proves to everyone else that hard work pays off,” Usgaard said. “[She’s proof] that it takes time, but you have to trust the process and it’ll all come through eventually.”</p>\n<p>Tsolis is happy to focus this much time and energy on her training because of how rewarding it is for her to see the results.</p>\n<p>“It’s like you get out of it what you put into it, and I spend so many hours practicing. I’m on the bike, I’m on the elliptical, I’m in the pool,” Tsolis said. “[All] because I can’t run as much as I want to because I get injured easily. So I’m just doing weights and everything to stay healthy and injury-free, and it’s so rewarding now that everything has come together.”</p>\n<p>Tori also points to the endless support and understanding of her lifestyle from her family and friends as a huge influence that pushes her and keeps her going. Her dad in particular has been trying to fly down from San Jose to watch all her races this year.</p>\n<p>“I feel bad, but he’s like, ‘It makes me really happy to see you race!’” said Tsolis. “I’m like, ‘I only race for like four minutes!’”</p>\n<p>Tori has had an incredible track career for someone who almost faded out of the sport altogether halfway through college.</p>\n<p>It only makes it more impressive that she’s now training and competing at her highest level ever at the same time as going through an intensive master’s program in economics.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 12, 2016’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-12/from-rec-runner-to-record-holder/","id":3305,"author":{"id":318,"name":"Duncan MacPhee"},"related":[3304,3303,3302],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/318"}},"__N_SSG":true}
