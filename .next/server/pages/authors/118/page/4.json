Project SERV is a financial award typically granted in as emergency funding to assist educational institutions facing a crisis. The grant enables existing campus-based mental health services provided by Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) to expand by temporarily hiring additional staff members.</p>\n<p>Director of C.A.P.S. Jeanne Stanford said it is “both sad and impressive” that the D.O.E. has an office to respond to violence in schools.</p>\n<p>“Many schools, colleges and universities have benefited from these funds to increase mental health services after episodes of violence,” Stanford said in an email. “This award is critical to our ability to continue to serve the increased needs of our community in the aftermath of the tragic violence in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Student Affairs will propose to use the grant money to lease office and reception space on the second floor of the I.V. Clinic at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming said. Fleming also said the grant will allow for expansion of campus staff to provide mental health and wellness services as well as more campus advocacy and prevention services to students.</p>\n<p>“The shared suite would house four counseling psychologists from CAPS, a sexual violence advocate and a sexual violence educator from C.A.R.E. and an additional student mental health coordinator, along with a receptionist/administrative assistant,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fleming said the facility could be used to host a variety of services in addition to mental health, including campus community-building events and activities.</p>\n<p>“Both C.A.P.S. and C.A.R.E. would anticipate scheduling group activities and meetings, as well as some programs open to the broader community in the meeting rooms and in the nearby church building once it is renovated as a community center,” Fleming said in an email.</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Wellness Services Angela Andrade said she is “thrilled about the grant” and that the funds will be used to support new counseling psychologists, a social worker, a counselor for faculty and staff and an additional staff member in Student Mental Health Coordination Services (SMHCS).</p>\n<p>“SMHCS provides outreach and support for students in distress and those concerned about a student in distress,” Andrade said. “The grant will allow us to assist more students and community members and extend our services into Isla Vista where many of our students live.”</p>\n<p>According to Stanford, C.A.P.S. requested two additional psychologists specifically to increase availability of counseling appointments and same-day crisis intakes for students dealing with acute stress.</p>\n<p>She also said C.A.P.S. requested resources for outreach to students, staff, faculty, teaching assistants and student groups in order to allow students to be “re-stimulated by returning to Isla Vista and campus, especially in anticipation of the year commemoration of the May 2014 tragedy.”</p>\n<p>“[C.A.P.S. will] increase the number of grief and trauma groups offered for those affected,” Stanford said in an email, “and increase number of places/locations on and off campus where psychologists are available.”</p>\n<p>The increased mental health support services on campus will help reduce and possibly prevent the longer term psychological effects tragic instances like the May 23 shootings have had on campus, Stanford said.</p>\n<p>“Together we will continue to grow stronger,” Stanford said in an email. “The funds will enable us to continue to spread the message of care for our fellow Gauchos, continue our Pathway to Healing, and encourage our community to speak up for each other as we all can benefit from an encouraging word or voice of concern.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Thursday, January 15, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Groups that received full funding included El Congreso, receiving $10,000 for their Raza College Rally, the Japanese Language Café receiving $250 and finally Chicano/Chicana Grads, which received $14,077 to hold an alternative graduation for Latino/Latina students. Cotillion Dance’s request for $150 for a non-dance social at the Student Resources Building was tabled after representatives for the club failed to show up to the meeting. The other groups will now wait to hear back from the Board and will receive responses to their funding requests when the A.S. Senate meets this Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Student comedy group Laughology requested $6,510 for their six upcoming shows after explaining that they had an impressive lineup including Dana Gould, a writer for the Simpsons, and Grammy Award winning comic Tig Notaro.</p>\n<p>“Winter quarter is historically slow for just about everything. It’s really hard to get people to come in — not true for us,” a spokesperson for the club said. “It seems like we are on a bit of a snowball effect here and we’ve got a really crazy order of comedians lined up. It is probably the best quarter we have ever booked.”</p>\n<p>The American Institute for Chemical Engineers (AIChE), a student association of chemical engineering students, asked for $842 for funding for an annual Southern California regional mixer that will be open to all students on campus at all year levels.</p>\n<p>The event will feature AIChE representatives from six universities and 80 chapters, according to AIChE Internal Vice President and third-year chemical engineering major Dilpreet Kaur.</p>\n<p>“Specifically right now, it is a very important for us to go because our current president is resigning due to personal issues and we have two other people stepping up in leadership,” Kaur said. “This conference will give a great opportunity for them to talk to other leaders and the other organizations and see how we can complete our events for this year and get advice on running our chapter.”</p>\n<p>The Lindy Circle, a Goleta-based dance organization, came to request $2,632 for a dancing event with a band they have every quarter. Representatives for the club said this year’s event will feature a premier swing dance act led by jazz guitarist Jonathan Stout.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Ensemble Troupe, a women’s student theatre organization on campus, requested $3,000 to put on the Vagina Monologues, an ensemble performance play featuring women’s personal perspectives on love, sex, rape, gender and other issues, held each Winter quarter. In addition, the Muslim Student Association requested an additional $284 for transportation to an upcoming MSA conference at UCLA. The Chinese Students and Scholars Association also requested to re-allocate $324, the Women’s Ensemble requested $3,000, literary arts magazine the Catalyst requested $4,759, Laughology requested $6510, the Lindy Circle requested $2,632 and the American Institute for Chemical Engineers requested $842.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Materials professor and recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics Shuji Nakamura was named a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI) on Dec 16.</p>\n<p>Nakamura will be inducted into NAI on March 20, along with 170 other newly named NAI fellows, as part of the 4th Annual Conference of the National Academy of Inventors at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where fellows will be awarded trophies, medals and rosette pins. The NAI is a non-profit organization with 414 fellows, collectively holding nearly 14,000 U.S. patents and representing over 150 institutions, and it serves to recognize inventors who hold U.S. Patents. Nominees must be named inventors on at least one patent issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and are chosen by their peers and then later approved by a selection committee.</p>\n<p>Nakamura said in an email that he credits the NAI honor to his invention of the energy efficient blue light emitting diode (LED) and blue laser diodes, for which he was recently also awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics. Nakmura also said his inspiration for his work comes from a deep examination of the world around him.</p>\n<p>“I like to think about anything deeply to understand the mechanism behind the scene,” Nakamura said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI President, founder and AAAS-Lemelson Invention Ambassador Paul R. Sanberg said designation as a fellow is the only high-level national honor specifically available to academic inventors.</p>\n<p>“The NAI fellows are prolific innovators whose discoveries and inventions have fostered new ideas, products and companies that benefit their institutions and communities and are making an impact on society,” Sanberg said in an email.</p>\n<p>NAI Vice President George Newkome, who himself holds 45 patents and has published 450 scientific papers, said Nakamura’s fellowship will lead the way for more faculty at the university to become NAI fellows in the future.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that professor Nakamura was chosen to be a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors it is a true honor to be part of NAI and I am sure that many others from UCSB will be following in his footsteps,” Newkome said in an email.</p>\n<p>Two other faculty are also NAI fellows — Materials Professor and Co-Director of UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) Steven DenBaars and Chemical Engineering professor and Founding Director of the Center for Bioengineering Samir Mitragotri.</p>\n<p>According to DenBaars, Nakamura’s fellowship further reinforces his position as a world renown innovator and highlights the widely impactful effect he has made globally with his innvention of the LED.</p>\n<p>“As a colleague and co-director of SSLEEC I am delighted that Shuji Nakamura is a new NAI Fellow,” DenBaars said in an email. “This is a strong endorsement of Shuji inventions and patents he has filed since coming to UCSB 14 years ago. This is indicative of Shuji’s innovative research and world-leading status of UCSB’s materials department.”</p>\n<p>According to Mitragotri, Nakamura’s election to the NIA is a significant recognition of his accomplishments in physics and materials science.</p>\n<p>“In addition to celebrating innovation, NAI enables the fellow to collectively think about some of the important aspects of promoting and sustaining academic innovation,” Mitragotri said in an email. “Shuji has made some of the most significant inventions of our generation. His election to NAI recognizes his accomplishments.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/nakamura-continues-to-pick-up-accolades/","id":2945,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2944,2943,2942],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Local Committee Meets Over I.V.

CSD to provide infrastructure and services to I.V. residents. Students, I.V. residents and community members and stakeholders attended the meeting to voice their opinion on the importance of AB 3 and push for LAFCO’s support of the bill. LAFCO assigned commissioners Doreen Farr, Greg Geyer and Jeff Moorhouse to work with Williams on the bill and report to LAFCO on the progress being made.</p>\n<p>Williams said he believes LAFCO should play a role in the process of getting AB 3 passed, in addition to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors.</p>\n<p>“I think the beginning is right now. I have asked for meetings with a number of individual board members and I would ask for meetings with all of them,” Williams said. “But in addition to individual meetings I would think LAFCO with your staff and board members should be a part of our stakeholder process.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the formation of a CSD in I.V. would assist the Board of Supervisors in the work they are doing to improve I.V.</p>\n<p>“I would say CSD could speed up the great work that board member Farr and others on the Board of Supervisors have done to provide safety lighting in Isla Vista, which is an integral part of the sexual assault issue out in Isla Vista,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>District Six Representative on the Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees Jonathan Abboud said I.V. needs self-governance because its dense population makes it unlike other unincorporated areas.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is a very unique place with probably one of the most dense communities on this side of the Mississippi and this CSD doesn’t go through the traditional LAFCO process because it is custom-tailored for Isla Vista,” Abboud said. “There are very specific things that are different for Isla Vista that don’t apply to a general unincorporated area. We waited for 40 years. Do we need to wait for another tragedy to get things going?”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the CSD would also help address the issue of insufficient law enforcement in I.V. in relation to a recent increase in population.</p>\n<p>“The second possibility would be to address the fact that while the population of Isla Vista has risen 25 percent, the amount of boots on the ground of law forcing officers has remained … relatively constant,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Thirty-year I.V. resident Thomas Dixon spoke at the meeting and said he supported AB 3 because he does not approve of manner which I.V. is currently governed.</p>\n<p>“The whole country is aware of Isla Vista being a problem community. [Isla Vistans] should have the power to at least control some of that,” Dixon said. “If you just obstruct the community service district and don’t come up with something better you’re just kicking the can down the road. We can’t just simply live with the status quo, that simply is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>Williams said the CSD could also play a role in providing structure and control in the midst of the I.V. party culture, by modeling tactics used at other public universities.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly, which had a huge public safety issue around partying in their community, addressed it by hiring some students to be the face of Public Safety to address parties that were getting out of control,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>Williams also said the role of the university in the establishment of self-governance in I.V. has taken a positive turn.</p>\n<p>“The role of the university — that is the one thing that changed and I view as an opportunity,” Williams said. “I have been very critical in the past, as have many residents … and the fact is that this process, this trustee report, is a huge change on the part of the attitude of the university — a willingness to say ‘We’re a part of the problem, we’re also a part of the solution’ and an opportunity that we have not had in 40 years, and I ask that we try to seize upon that opportunity.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59097\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59097\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-05/local-committee-meets-over-i-v-csd/","id":4801,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4800,4799,4798],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Womyn’s Commission appealed to reallocate over $5,000 in funds previously set aside for travel. Several funding measures were also passed, including Off-Campus Senators’ request to receive $100 for fliers and food for a forum this Friday as well as the Black Student Union’s request for $250 for the Black Coalition Conference’s registration fees and $1,035 for hotel costs for a group of 60 people.</p>\n<p>A member of the Excursion Club asked for a reallocation of funds, as the club wanted to put the $950 received last week to instead pay $100 each for the bands Sun Daes and Yancellor Chang as well as $750 for their equipment.</p>\n<p>“Once we realized what funding we would be getting from the Board we talked to the bands and they all need equipment, but we didn’t get any funding for equipment,” the Excursion Club member said. “It is pretty vital to our event because we really need the lighting to make it a safe event and the generators power the lights.”</p>\n<p>The Japanese Language Cafe asked for $420 for three events which are open to the public: a $100 karaoke potluck on Dec. 4 in the Multicultural Center Lounge, a $160 Winter BBQ at Goleta Beach on Jan 16 and a $160 Spring BBQ at Goleta Beach on April 11.</p>\n<p>Japanese Language Cafe President Eric Lee said the karaoke potluck would be a great final event for students graduating or returning home.</p>\n<p>“We think that it’s a great chance for everyone to get together and exchange cultures and many times at the end of the quarter some people are graduating or going back to Japan,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Finance and Business Committee Chief Financial Officer Andre Theus said the committee was unable to fund the event, as the club has already been funded for an off-campus event for the quarter.</p>\n<p>“We can’t fund you at all for your Goleta Beach events because you have used your one time exception for an off-campus event,” Theus said.</p>\n<p>Lee said the club would then only request $100 for the potluck this Thursday, but the committee said they would not fund the club’s potluck and suggested the club try to find place on campus for their other two events.</p>\n<p>Theus said the students should relocate the event in order to receive funding.</p>\n<p>“If you had it here on campus we could fund you for those two events,” Theus said, “so you can come back again because we can’t fund you for the rest of this quarter. Change from Goleta Beach to on campus.”</p>\n<p>Co-Chair of the A.S. Womyn’s Commission Danielle Maldonado requested successfully that the committee approve the transfer of their $5,740 travel budget to special projects.</p>\n<p>“It has always been there, but we haven’t ever used any of it yet and I’m still leaving money in there in case it ever is needed,” Maldonado said. “The only conference that we’ve considered going to is UC Berkeley’s Empowering Women of Color, and it is during our finals week, so that’s really the only conference we wanted to go to. We have been looking this year but we haven’t found any.”</p>\n<p>Co-Presidents of the Art Club Janice Agustin and Lucy Maybank asked for $700 for the Honors’ Art Show this upcoming Spring and $1,050 for the Undergraduate Art Show in June 2015, stating they had not received funding from the university Art Department.</p>\n<p>Senator Esteni Dominguez explained the budget breakdown for the Art Club’s request to other Senators.</p>\n<p>“They are just asking for food, music and materials to put up and put down artwork,” Dominguez said, “The only reason why the second event is more is because they’re expecting double the amount of people coming for the second show.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Committee met yesterday evening at the State Street Room in the UCen to hear requests from 18 student organizations for funding.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, the committee decided to fully fund 12 organizations, did not fund one request, tabled two requests and partially funded three requests. Discussion items included the introduction and approval of a new process for distributing honoraria, or monetary compensation, for Program Board officers. Other discussion items included honoraria bill for the Commission on Disability Equality (CODE) that was tabled indefinitely for consideration by the honoraria committee, and a bill to further availability and access of information in A.S. elections code, which was passed.</p>\n<p>Requests granted by the committee included $450 to the University Affairs Committee for honoraria for three student members, $250 for the External Affairs Committee, $75 for the On Campus Senator’s event focused on healthy, productive study foods from the Isla Vista Co-op, $10,550 for the Black Graduates group, $3,840 for La Famille de Colores for tickets and flights for an upcoming conference, $4,000 for the Impact Movement’s national conference in Chicago, $147 for Vocal Motion a cappella group’s fall concert, $80 for Delta Sigma Zeta’s scantrons and bluebooks for a group study session, $400 for the Catalyst Literary Art Magazine third issue launch party, specifically for publicity purposes, to provide propane to keep their upcoming event area warm as well as to provide sculpture transportation.</p>\n<p>The Asian American Christian group EPIC requested and was approved to receive $3,000 for an annual conference held in Orange County at the Doubletree Hotel.<br>\nOfficer for EPIC and fourth-year student Esther Euseon said they needed funding because of their particularly large group this year.</p>\n<p>“We are actually, this year, the largest Christian Asian-American organization on campus,” Euseon said. “We love it when anybody comes to our events.”</p>\n<p>Finance and Business Committee member and second-year history of public policy major Izeah Garcia said EPIC is very inclusive as a Christian organization, unlike other religious groups on campus.</p>\n<p>“”I’ve been to Epic and I’m not Protestant or Christian, in that sense I am Catholic, and honestly they’re pretty chill,” Garcia said. “When organizations say ‘Oh yeah we’re very inclusive,’ it’s hard for people to think they can get into those spaces, but I think with specifically religious organizations they try to make it so they’re as inclusiveness possible.”</p>\n<p>The Art Club requested money for two different events, totaling $1,750, but both were tabled. Representatives from the club will attempt to get money from the Art Department before re-requesting from the Finance Board.</p>\n<p>The Cheer Team also received funding for registration as well as lodging for the USA Nationals competition in Anaheim and a separate competition in Atlanta. The delegated amount was $2,750 out of the $16,780 the team had requested for transportation for future cheer competitions.</p>\n<p>One of Cheer Team’s captains and third-year film and media studies major Nick Gorton-Bufano said this is the first time since 2003 that the team has had both females and males.</p>\n<p>“This is the first year that we’ve been coed since 2003, so that’s cool,” Gorton-Bufano said. “And we gained a lot of support at basketball games from people because we’re co-ed. So we are trying to grow the co-ed aspect as well.”</p>\n<p>Model United Nations also requested $7,332 for extra transportation and housing for their annual Berkeley conference, and received $1,426 to pay for registration fees.</p>\n<p>UCen UStudy, a service that keeps the UCen open for longer than average hours during finals week, received $700 of the $1,085 they asked for to pay for building management to keep Corwin Pavilion open from 1 a.m. – 6 a.m. and to pay for a massage therapist. The Excursion Club received $950 of the $2,750 they requested for I.V. First Fridays, a new events series made to draw people away from Del Playa Drive and the house party scene to provide a large scale source of entertainment in through a variety of activities in I.V., held on the first Friday of every month.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A prior version of this article incorrectly quoted Izeah Garcia as saying ““I’ve been to EPIC and I’m not Protestant or Catholic and honestly they’re pretty chill.” Garcia actually said “I’ve been to Epic and I’m not Protestant or Christian in that sense I am Catholic.” The article has been updated accordingly.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58790\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58790\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-25/associated-students-discuss-student-organization-financial-requests/","id":2407,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2406,2405,2404],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The Student Affairs Committee also listened to reports from the Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC) about a bill to create the Code of Conduct for Associated Students.</p>\n<p>The SFAC chair and fourth-year economics and accounting major Sean McKenzie said their group is separate from A.S. and is composed of 12 voting members, including two sophomores, two juniors, two seniors, two grad reps, two faculty and two staff representatives.</p>\n<p>“We are a committee under the Student Affairs Department, so we have nothing to do with Associated Students at all, even though we have Associated Students as our Ex-Officio Advisory members,” McKenzie said.</p>\n<p>According to McKenzie, the SFAC hears out public requests for departments for one-time projects such as maintenance requests, student health requests and more.</p>\n<p>“In Fall we open up public requests for those departments like the MultiCultural Center, the Rec Center, CAPS — there’s a whole list on our website actually,” McKenzie said. “So they come in [and] in the Fall they request money from us. We have a pot every year of money — it’s $285,000 each year, that’s based on a percentage of the student services fee. So based on that money, the Committee will allocate to these departments based on if they see fit whether they are going to improve the student life basically.”</p>\n<p>McKenzie also said all UC’s have a SFAC, and they meet up at various locations every quarter to work on campaigns.</p>\n<p>The Chair of the Senate Affairs Committee and second-year political science major Cassandra Mancini said SHAC had a meeting last Tuesday discussing the new meningitis vaccine, which would require three shots.</p>\n<p>“Last year, 50 percent of the student body got both shots, so that’s pretty cool. We’re very protected against Meningitis,” Mancini said. “But this new vaccine is not recommended — or you don’t have to get it if you got last year’s one — but, it would be good for new students and transfer students to get. So we will be offering that.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the new vaccine will cost money, but the amount is currently unknown.</p>\n<p>“It’ll just be in the Student Health Office, so anyone can get it at any time — it’s also not free like it was last year,” Mancini said. “They didn’t mention how much it costs. But also, I don’t know if insurance will cover it until next year, so that’s something that we might have to start talking about pretty soon.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the cost of getting the flu shot is rising, and there will be an official meeting on Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI) next Thursday.</p>\n<p>“The costs of flu shots is being increased from $20-$30 for non-Gaucho Health Insurance people, and we talked about whether that was prohibitive or not,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>Mancini said the distance criteria will be extended to approximately 50 miles next year in order to include students who have Kaiser health insurance, which is currently not a sufficient alternative health care providers according to current GHI stantards, though MediCal students would still be denied.</p>\n<p>“Kaiser students can easily get waived,” Mancini said. “So that will be great for students because that was a big issue this year. Us and Santa Cruz are the only UC’s that didn’t have a Kaiser within a close distance.”</p>\n<p>FEC student representative and fourth year student Nikka Kurland said the Faculty Committee’s responsibilities include collecting information from end-of-the-quarter course assessments.</p>\n<p>“They review self-assessments from different departments and kind of like approve name changes [of] the department names like changes of majors and things like that,” Kurland said. “All the little surveys that you guys fill out at the end of each quarter,  like ranking the classes and stuff, basically that information does get compiled and people actually do look at it, and people actually take it very, very seriously.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator Matthew Santos presented an amendment to add a second policy called “A Bill to Create the Code of Conduct for Associated Students” on to policy one in the A.S. Senate Bill.</p>\n<p>“Policy one would be created as the actual code of conduct with the A.S., all elected officials and the five bullets underneath,” Santos said. “The amendment that I would propose creates policy two under that.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said the Code of Conduct had previously been voted on and approved by the Senate, but that the second policy in need of approval included the travel agreement under the five points for elected officials, appointed officials, general members and employees of A.S.</p>\n<p>According to Santos, the agreement would promote “professionalism, civility, respect and courtesy.”</p>\n<p>“We would just call that the A.S. Code of Conduct Travel Agreement… voted upon by the Senate, specific for traveling to events,” Santos said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58703\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58703\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/a-s-senate-university-affairs-committee-debates-finances-policy/","id":2885,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2884,2883,2882],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Forum Discusses Recent Issues Plaguing Isla Vista","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The League of Women Voters of Santa Barbara hosted a community forum titled the “The Future of Isla Vista — An Ongoing Conversation” yesterday at the Louise Lowry Davis Center to discuss the rec...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p></p><div id=\"attachment_58245\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58245\" data-attachment-id=\"58245\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/i-v-residents-to-hold-self-governance-panel/iv_photos_johnclow_11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=3000%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1358266877\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"IV_Photos_JohnClow_11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IV_Photos_JohnClow_11-1024x682.jpg?resize=500%2C333\" alt=\"Schunk and Abboud hope to eventually see the creation of a Special Legislative District.

Part of the drafting process for this law will involve I.V. community input. <em>John Clow/Daily Nexus</em></p></div><br>\nThe League of Women Voters of Santa Barbara hosted a community forum titled the “The Future of Isla Vista — An Ongoing Conversation” yesterday at the Louise Lowry Davis Center to discuss the recent findings and goals of a report released by the UCSB Foundation Trustees’ Advisory Committee, including efforts for self-governance and other proposed remedies for improving Isla Vista. \n<p>The League of Women Voters provided brown bag lunches and opened up the event to the public to pose questions to I.V. Recreation &amp; Park District General Manager Rodney Gould, Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming, Acting Chief Deputy of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office Sam Gross and Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs Cameron Schunk. Topics included concerns regarding I.V. culture, forms of government, student activities and community development. </p>\n<p>Schunk said the lack of a government body dedicated to managing I.V. remains a significant contributor to I.V.’s various problems, though there have been three different attempts to establish such bodies in 1972, 1975 and 1985. </p>\n<p>“In 1972, there was actually legislation passed called the Isla Vista Campus Community Services District, however, that legislation was never voted into law, because the community felt incorporation was on the horizon. So why create a district when we are just going to be a city?’” Schunk said. “I think we can all see how that turned out.” </p>\n<p>According to Schunk, establishing a special legislative district as a form of self-governance requires the approval of the Land Agency Formation Committee for Santa Barbara (LAFCO), who recommended the county assist in establishing the district. LAFCO, a state agency existing in every county in California, helps citizens, counties, cities and special districts work on issues concerning jurisdictional change.  </p>\n<p>“They told us to approach the legislation with this, as they would better be able to tailor-make a solution for you and would be better able to work with you on what you do and don’t want to see in that legislation,” Schunk said. </p>\n<p>Schunk said the Special Legislative District would make governing decisions in I.V. such as approving additional taxes to operate the area as well as providing appropriate services for residents. </p>\n<p>“One of the key things is that we didn’t want to instill a higher property tax on I.V.,” Schunk said. “We felt that that wouldn’t address the issue, so one of the key things that was proposed through the Special Legislative District was this idea of the users’ utility tax — that’s a scalable tax based on utility usage … What we were looking at there was also including a tax break for long-term residents.” </p>\n<p>According to Schunk, he and others involved in the I.V. self-governance movement plan to continue holding community forums to gauge public opinion regarding resident preferences toward government in order to base their action on decisions made by local residents and students. </p>\n<p>“What we will be doing is opening up community conversations,” Schunk said. “We will be running those for both the Spanish-speaking-only oriented style and then in an open-forum style … What we’ll be doing there is hoping to highlight common concerns that we see throughout the community and then bring those to the legislators so the conversation continues to happen.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he hopes to serve as a conduit from which I.V. residents can express their desires concerning self-governance.</p>\n<p>“Now let’s say the entire community comes together and says we don’t want self-government,” Schunk said. “Well, then we put the brakes on it. We let our elected officials know.”</p>\n<p>During discussion regarding the university trustee report’s proposed solutions for improving safety and security in I.V., Gross said forming relationships with multiple enforcement groups may help address crime.</p>\n<p>“We operate today 24 hours a day,” Gross said. “The aspects of public safety that we bring to the table, through our folks, is that there are partnerships with a number of good, collaborative efforts.”</p>\n<p>The forum also debated the effects of the increasing student population in I.V. in connection with an alleged increase in crime and disturbances. According to Gross, I.V.’s party culture has taken on a destructive nature due to students’ irresponsible behavior.</p>\n<p>“I.V. has taken a dramatic change over the years. Today the culture has changed,” Gross said. “It’s a collaborative effort between law enforcement and the UC, the County Fire Department and AMR, our medical ambulance provider, to deal with what happens as a result of the inappropriate behavior of kids that just don’t know better and haven’t learned life’s lessons yet.”</p>\n<p>Fleming said the university has policies in place that inform parents if students face an alcohol- or drug-related arrest or citation and a campus disciplinary process for violations regarding acts of violence or stalking. According to Fleming, although there is no campus disciplinary process for alcohol- or drug-related crimes, the parent notification system might help to discourage criminal activity. </p>\n<p>“We don’t currently have extension of our regulations that apply to students on campus for these kinds of things in Isla Vista,” Fleming said. “We do have extension of our jurisdiction for the more serious things like acts of violence, assault, sexual assault, hazing, stalking, domestic violence. Those kinds of more serious things we do hold our students accountable and take them through our conduct system.” </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Thursday, November 20, 2014’s

serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The California Coastal Commission approved UCSB’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) Thursday, which will add 5,000 undergraduate students and hundreds of faculty and staffers to the university by 2025.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The LRDP, also called ‘Vision 2025,’ was prepared by university officials after reviewing projected enrollment demands and analyzing limitations of campus, traffic, expenses and feedback from the community. Coastal Commission staff member Shana Grey presented the plan, which details a one percent annual enrollment increase until 2025 to a maximum enrollment of 25,000 students. The current LRDP was created in 1990 and the new drafts were released in March 2008, followed by a public hearing in June 2008.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The new plan will involve campus development, including changes in academic programs and increased campus housing for students, faculty and staff. According to a LRDP statement, the additional housing developments could exacerbate issues related to water usage, traffic circulation and greenhouse gas emissions but have held public hearings extending public comment on the development. </span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">California Coastal Commission Vice-Chair Jana Zimmer said university officials and environmental consultants discussed issues concerning the higher demand of water supply a larger student population would cause.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">We discussed the water supply issue at some length,” Zimmer said. “There is additional capacity in the reclaimed water system that is about one-half capacity now.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Senior Associate Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher said considerations for additional parking space will be a crucial aspect to the development plan.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Transportative systems and alternative transportation as opposed to vehicular and loads of transportation that we are accustomed to and the role of parking in the whole analysis is critically important,” Fisher said. “I hope that we will have an Isla Vista parking program as part of the county update to the Isla Vista master plan.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Deputy Director of the South Central Coast District John Ainsworth said the renewal of the LRDP was difficult but successful.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The preparation of this review LRDP update has been a long, and let me say, complicated process, stretching out over a number of years,” Ainsworth said. “The staff, the university, and the coalition of environmental groups are all now in agreement — and this is a huge achievement in my view.”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Chancellor Henry T.

to a UC statement released this past Thursday. According to the UCSA petition, the association will “actively lobby” UCOP and the Board of Regents, will write letters to Senators and Congressmen “expressing the resolution’s sentiments” and will conduct a system-wide survey to gather input about President Barack Obama’s “Plan to Make College More Affordable” and university rating system, and relay the feedback to the US Department of Education.</p>\n<p>UCOP spokesperson Brooke Converse said the UC would work to minimize the increase in tuition by seeking additional funds from the state.</p>\n<p>“We are aware of the petition,” Converse said. “No one likes a tuition increase, least of all the University, but we hope to work with students to advocate for additional funding from the state to offset the potential increase.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Despite state funding increasing over the last two years, the UC still faces a long-term gap between projected revenues and its basic funding needs for educational programs.</p>\n<p>The UC still remains $460 million below its 2007–‘08 level of state funding, and is below what it needs to continue to meet its commitment to admitting all eligible California students and to “preserve the quality of a UC education,” according to the UC statement released last week.</p>\n<p>The UC also stated that additional state funding could allow UC to avoid a tuition increase.</p>\n<p>According to first-year pre-biology student Ashley Tringali, paying more tuition right now is justified and will likely pay off later on.</p>\n<p>“I have been reading articles about the changes that they want to make and I feel like right now we might have to pay more, but I am investing my money into a good education and hopefully I’ll be able to use that education,” Tringali said.</p>\n<p>However, first-year economics and global studies double major Kayla Saliba said she agrees with UCSA’s petition to put financial responsibility onto the state.</p>\n<p>“The state should not be cutting the money. But if that is not an option, then if you are cutting the funds that the school is getting, what is going to happen to the school?” Saliba said. “Already students and teachers are scrambling for resources. How are we going to pay for things that the university needs?”</p>\n<p>Tringali said increasing tuition to improve the UC is a worthwhile investment.</p>\n<p>“I know the UCs … and especially here at UC Santa Barbara, we have great research and opportunities and connections,” Tringali said. “I feel like if I need to pay more now, yeah it might be bad financially for me right now, but I know it is going to pay off later. I am totally fine with investing in my future.”</p>\n<p>But according to Saliba, the state is obliged to provide affordable education for their public universities.</p>\n<p>“We should be getting more money, but it should not be coming from the students,” Saliba said, “it should be coming from the government, and that is a basic thing I feel we need to start doing as a nation.”</p><div

courtesy of Disney</em></p></div>\n<p>“Guardians of the Galaxy” film editor Fred Raskin spoke during a Q&amp;A session yesterday in the Pollock Theater as a part of a three week series by the Carsey-Wolf Center called “Focus On: The Editor.”</p>\n<p>Film and Media Studies professor Joshua Moss, who is also Raskin’s friend, interviewed the film editor about his work, which includes “Boogie Nights,” “All the Pretty Horses” and<em> “</em>Kill Bill 1 and<em> </em>2<em>.”</em> Raskin also transitioned into editing for Justin<em> </em>Lin on<em> “</em>Better Luck Tomorrow,” “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,” “Fast  Five,” “Django Unchained” and “Guardians of the Galaxy<em>.” </em>His next project will be Quentin Tarantino’s next film “The Hateful Eight,” a film about bounty hunters in post-Civil War Wyoming.</p>\n<p>Raskin said he began working on films right after graduating from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and worked with James Gunn on one of his first jobs, a 1997 comedy called “Tromeo &amp; Juliet.” Raskin said he and Gunn had kept in touch since their work on that project, and that it was he who invited him to work on “Guardians of the Galaxy.”</p>\n<p>According to Raskin, he was more involved with “Guardians of the Galaxy” than any other movie he has worked on in the past, mostly because meeting with the Marvel executives about the project took an extensive amount of time. According to Raskin, meetings would take about three hours every day.</p>\n<p>“We would all sit in a room and we would talk about everything from how we are going to tackle one particular scene that might be problematic, to how we were going to restructure the first third of the movie for what we’re going to shoot when it comes to the additional photography phase of the movie,” Raskin said.</p>\n<p>Raskin said a particularly difficult aspect of his work on the film involved the challenges posed by fleshing out the character of Ronan, the film’s villain.</p>\n<p>“Probably the biggest problem the story had was the villain storyline,” Raskin said. “That Ronan’s motives weren’t entirely clear and he just wasn’t so well-developed so a lot of the recent material was there to make his goals more focused.”</p>\n<p>According to Moss, the strong point of “Guardians of the Galaxy” is the way the characters interact with one another while dealing with the orb, as the character interaction among “these five misfits” succeeds in conveying each character arc.</p>\n<p>“When I first saw it, what was interesting to me was the slapstick comedy bit where they’re all grabbing the orb early on in the film,” Moss said. “Is important because it sets up the idea that the orb gets to be something everybody else wants. The orb is the way we get to see characters but it’s not what the movie is really about.”</p>\n<p>Raskin said another challenging aspect of “Guardians of the Galaxy” was working with the comedic elements of the film.</p>\n<p>“In terms of comedy, we determined what jokes worked and what jokes didn’t and that’s the kind of thing that you feel when you watch the movie with an audience,” Raskin said.</p>\n<p>According to film and media studies undergraduate advisor Joe Palladino, the “Focus On: The Editor” series includes people with various positions in the film industry.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a ‘Focus on: Directors,’ we had a ‘Focus on: Music Videos,’ we had a ‘Focus on: Sound,’ so we wanted to do a ‘Focus on Editing,’” Palladino said. “We do a lot of screen writing stuff, the script to screen stuff, so we wanted to look at different people who maybe understand. They appreciate and try to bring someone in and give that person a little bit of a spotlight.”</p>\n<p>Palladino said the goal with Raskin’s presentation was to highlight the importance of the work of editors and other positions in the industry do that typically do not receive as much attention from audiences.</p>\n<p>“The editors are often people that are ignored and so we are looking at editors now for the series,” Palladino said. “There are a lot of students who say ‘I want to be a director,’ but there are so many other creative things, so we start presenting them with other creative fields. The idea of the Pollock programming is to give everyone a wide spectrum of film.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58031\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58031\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-06/carsey-wolf-center-hosts-film-editor-fred-raskin/","id":2962,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2961,2960,2959],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/118"}},"__N_SSG":true}
