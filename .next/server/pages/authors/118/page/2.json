The IVMP mandates regular street parking surveys and stipulates that if the survey finds a parking vacancy rate below 15 percent for three consecutive UCSB academic quarters, the county will implement a permit parking program to bring parking vacancy rates back above the 15 percent mark. Many I.V. residents take issue with the 2013 survey findings, claiming I.V. parking is more impacted than the survey suggested and requires a more immediate solution. The Commission ultimately voted to recommend IVMP’s existing decision to continue surveys before implementing a permit program.</p>\n<p>Deputy Director of Long Range Planning Division Matt Schneider said parking surveys, conducted by Fehr and Peers Transportation Consultants, help monitor parking vacancy rates.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“The purpose of the parking survey … is to monitor the vacancy rate, with 15 percent vacancy rate being the tipping point,” Schneider said. “Based on the current data we have available, we are below that threshold. There certainly will be a need once we cross that to develop a more robust parking program.”</p>\n<p>Planning Commission member Daniel Blough said a parking survey is not necessary, as parking in I.V. is clearly impacted.</p>\n<p>“On that one issue I just can’t see wasting the money or the time,” Blough said. “I don’t need a survey to tell me there is a problem.”</p>\n<p>Planning Commission member Joan Hartmann said parking surveys should monitor parking until results “trigger” a program.</p>\n<p>“It may be that we already have a strong sense that there is not enough parking, that it has already met the trigger since that survey was done in 2013, but I think we need ongoing surveys to see if there is change,” Hartmann said. “It is mrely a monitoring program and if we have other strategies to deal with parking, then we would like to see those changes on the ground.”</p>\n<p>Hartmann said UCSB faculty and staff parking may be impacting I.V. due to insufficient on-campus parking, meaning improved UCSB parking could help I.V.</p>\n<p>“Maybe there are other things in addition to the parking permit program that we can be working on,” Hartmann said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees member and UCSB alum Jonathan Abboud said I.V. should have a way to locally oversee the proposed permit program.<br>\n“I personally would support moving the plan forward now, but we should have an Area Planning Commission in Isla Vista in the future to oversee the implementation of the plan to make it more community-reflective and more community-based,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students College of Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said I.V. needs an effective parking solution because many students depend on cars for transportation.</p>\n<p>“Oftentimes, it is dismissed that students need cars, but oftentimes it is very vital that they have them, so adequate parking really needs to be considered,” Minoiefar said. “The landlords’ use of high parking fees for their parking spots is an issue.”</p>\n<p>The Commission will send its recommendations to the Board of Supervisors, which will consider the revised IVMP this winter. If the Board adopts the updates, it will submit the IVMP to the California Coastal Commission in Santa Barbara County in Spring 2016.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, November 5, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66165\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66165\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-05/board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking-board-considers-solution-to-i-v-parking/","id":4626,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4625,4624,4623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"University Awards ‘Promise’ to New Scholars","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Logo-Featured-e1527757142402.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Santa Barbara’s Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships administered for the first time this year the Promise Scholar Program, which recognizes incoming undergraduates who show potential in acad...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UC Santa Barbara’s Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships administered for the first time this year the Promise Scholar Program, which recognizes incoming undergraduates who show potential in academic, research and student leadership positions and provides them a minimum of $120,000 in financial support.</p>\n<p>The program allows students and their families to plan for all four years of tuition as opposed to traditional financial aid programs, which are on a year-by-year basis. Scholars are given a minimum of $120,000 to go towards tuition, room and board, loan fees, health and books. The program was created by Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Claudine Michel and Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Director Michael Miller after they recognized a fundamental issue with the traditional financial aid program design.</p>\n<p>Miller said a major obstacle families with financial need face is having to commit to paying for four years of education though traditional financial aid programs only provide funding one year at a time.</p>\n<p>“I can’t think of any other major purchase that works that way,” Miller said in an email. “By providing students with a four-year outlook, they are able to focus on why they are here, which is to get a world class education and entrench themselves in the UCSB community.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, UCSB stands as number three on the Top Colleges Doing the Most for Low-Income Students list by The Upshot, which measures colleges’ efforts on economic diversity.</p>\n<p>“We do a great deal for low income students at UCSB,” Miller said in an email. “Approximately 75% of undergraduates at UCSB have financial aid and we disburse about $400 million annually. For most families, a UCSB education would not be possible without some sort of financial aid.”</p>\n<p>Miller said the new Promise Scholars program is offered to dedicated students from areas of California where it is less common for high school graduates to attend UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We really were not sure how the program would be received so we made a modest number of offers and we focused on areas of the state we have not been able to recruit students to UCSB in the past,” Miller said in an email. “All of the students selected for the Promise Scholar program were highly meritorious and showed a great deal of potential.”</p>\n<p>Academic Initiatives Associate Director Mark Shishim said he is confident that this group of Promise Scholars will positively impact the UCSB community in more ways than one.</p>\n<p>“This is an extraordinary group of students – I’m confident their contributions to our University will be evident in scholarship, leadership and citizenship,” Shishim said in an email. “I’m honored to be a part of their journey and proud to welcome them to the Gaucho family.”</p>\n<p>Miller said he has very high hopes for the program and wants to see the students involved on campus without worrying about finances.</p>\n<p>“I would love to see our Promise Scholars become campus leaders, work closely with faculty, participate in research and give back to the UCSB community in some way,” Miller said in an email. “By eliminating the guessing game about whether they can afford to stay at UCSB, we are hoping to see positive results in all aspects of our students’ lives.”</p>\n<p>Miller said the program could change the way financial aid is administered across the UC.</p>\n<p>“I truly believe we are on to something with multiyear financial aid awards,” Miller said in an email. “If we remain thoughtful and continue to collaborate across our campus, I think this could revolutionize the way financial aid is administered at the University of California and beyond.”</p>\n<p>Promise Scholar Advisor Natalie Gonzalez said the promise scholars benefit from various resources and opportunities to which other students do not have access.<br>\n“One of the things they are invited to is a faculty night, and that is just for them to be able to meet other faculty members on campus,” Gonzalez said. “In the Winter Quarter will be workshops on budgeting and how to renew financial aid applications, making sure that they are meeting those deadlines as well.”</p>\n<p>Gonzalez said she wants to introduce Promise Scholars to research opportunities and other resources.</p>\n<p>“We will have more information on how to get involved in undergraduate research, how to talk to faculty members, how to seek mentorship, and overall how to be exposed to the different resources that UCSB has to offer,” Gonzalez said.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez also said she hopes the program will build a support system for the scholars that will increase retention.</p>\n<p>“I hope they have peers that they can contact and connect with in order to have that home away from home support system with each other, but also with staff, faculty and other community members that are here to support them,” Gonzalez said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSA also reviewed the May Revise of the UCOP Budget Act of 2015, which froze tuition at current levels for a total of six years but allowed for mandatory tuition increases pegged to inflation after the six-year period.</p>\n<p>According to State Department of Finance data Flaherty presented, the primary source of state revenue is Personal Income Tax (P.I.T.), the secondary source is Sales and Use Tax (SUT) and additional revenue is from corporate tax. Flaherty said the P.I.T. has increased more than the SUT in recent years because California’s economy is largely based in universities and educational institutions rather than taxable services.</p>\n<p>“Nowadays … we don’t have a sales tax on services and our economy in California is very much a knowledge-based economy,” Flaherty said. “Good for us, because we are all in school.”</p>\n<p>According to Flaherty, the State now decides its budget in June, as opposed to January in previous years. Flaherty said this change benefits the state but poses a challenge to the UCs, as the universities must plan the yearly budget without knowing the State’s contribution.</p>\n<p>“It’s a huge improvement now that the budget is settled in June because the fiscal year starts in July,” Flaherty said. “[It’s] still problematic for the University because in November we are set to approve our budget for the University, we accept students in the spring and we are not really sure how much funding we are going to receive from the State until after that.”</p>\n<p>Flaherty also said the relationship between the State and the UC is characterized by “volatility.”</p>\n<p>“It’s has been that way pretty much forever,” Flaherty said. “Agreements between UC and the administration in the past, called compacts or partnerships … are things that can’t bring stability and predictability to the UC state budget.”</p>\n<p>According to Flaherty, UC partnerships with the Governor are generally multi-year and extend beyond the one-year budgeting cycle that the Legislature appropriates for.</p>\n<p>“So a lot of state agencies — so labor unions for instance — a lot of businesses who have advocated for and received a tax benefit, for instance — they like to plan those over a multi-year basis,” Flaherty said.</p>\n<p>Flaherty said the State Legislature may oppose multi-year partnerships between the governor and the UC because their decision-making role is bypassed.</p>\n<p>“The Legislature is far less fond of these funding frameworks than administrations and the University,” Flaherty said. “The Legislature is basically left out of the process, yet they are asked to approve the funding for it without having had that much input.”</p>\n<p>According to Flaherty, the UC budget fell from 103 billion dollars to 87 billion within one fiscal year after the 2008 recession.</p>\n<p>“Less revenue resulted in cuts for almost all of the agencies … and all departments, and of course UC, CSU, the community colleges [and] K-12 were not exempt from those cuts by any stretch of the imagination,” Flaherty said.</p>\n<p>Flaherty also said the State proposed a 25 million dollar addition to the current UC budget year if the university projects enrollment of 5,000 more undergraduate students by next May.</p>\n<p>“The State is attempting to incentivize the University to really grow enrollment by a lot more than we anticipated,” Flaherty said. “Initially back in November … last year we were thinking of growing about 2,200 students, a lot of budgetary uncertainty at that time … so there was basically no growth of undergraduate students or marginal growth of undergraduate students.”</p>\n<p>Flaherty said he does not like the term “affordability” when discussing tuition because it is not the only factor in student expenses.</p>\n<p>“From a student’s perspective, affordability is a total cost of attendance,” Flaherty said. “It involves housing … it involves the reality of how much support some students provide to their families. It is not just tuition alone.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-reviews-ucop-2015-16-budget/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-reviews-ucop-2015-16-budget/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-reviews-ucop-2015-16-budget/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-reviews-ucop-2015-16-budget/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-13/ucsa-reviews-ucop-2015-16-budget/","id":3617,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[3616,3615,3614],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"An Inside Look at the Roles of SB Peace Officers","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Plastino-Horizontal-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Plastino-Horizontal-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), clad in khaki uniforms, and UCSB Police Department (UCPD), clad in blue, hold overlapping jurisdiction in the UC Santa Barbara community.

UCPD works alongside IVFP to represent the university’s interest in matters of law and safety in I.V. while also patrolling the approximately 1,000 acres of UCSB’s campus, maintaining 24-hour uniformed patrol and police response.</p>\n<p>IVFP Sergeant Daniel Calderon said UCPD officers and IVFP deputies have similar duties and often rotate roles.</p>\n<p>“We all have the same peace officers powers of the state,” Calderon said. “It is just that those officers that are assigned to the campus only work on the campus during that time period. Isla Vista, this particular community, is an unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County, so [IVFP] handles all of the emergency calls for service.”</p>\n<p>There are currently seven officers from UCPD both patrolling campus and working in I.V. alongside IVFP, according to UCPD Sergeant Robert Romero.</p>\n<p>“That is on a rotational basis, so once every year and a half, two years, an officer will leave the campus patrol station and go work eight months to a year out at Isla Vista,” Romero said. “They are the ones that are really the heart and soul of the department.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP responds to crimes such as burglary, theft, battery and assault, but not traffic accidents, which fall under the California Highway Patrol’s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>“We don’t handle the traffic enforcement out here — that is still Highway Patrol — they’re still responsible for handling traffic accident investigations, things like that,” Calderon said. “But we can still pull people over — issue citations for speeding, stop signs we can still make arrests for drunk driving and things like that — it is just that that is not necessarily our primary duty.”</p>\n<p>UCPD’s campus jurisdiction includes lecture halls and university housing in I.V., according to Calderon.</p>\n<p>“All of the buildings that they own that surround Isla Vista, all of the student housing, the faculty housing and [family] student housing, all of the new construction projects that you see — that is all UC property,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD hosts safety presentations for students, especially those living in residence halls, and collaborates with them on solutions to solve public safety issues.</p>\n<p>“We go to different functions that residential life might be putting on,” Romero said. “These interactions we have with students is, basically, we talk to them about things on how to be safe and they talk to us about what they like, what they don’t like from their police department. So it is an exchange of ideas and how to come up with a better plan on how to keep the community safe.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said any student or I.V. resident can join IVFP deputies on a walk-along to experience a day in the life of an officer.</p>\n<p>“From a UCSB student’s perspective, there is just a bunch of cops walking around. Do you know what they are doing?” Calderon said. “That is why I encourage people to do walk-alongs so they can kind of see and point out the problems that we try to tell people about.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, IVFP deputies are trained to use “tactical communication” skills when dealing with “chaotic” scenarios.</p>\n<p>“Let’s say I’m working Del Playa on a Saturday night. It’s really busy and if I went into a party or I went into a fight and people are yelling and it’s a very chaotic, rapidly evolving scene, it is not going to benefit me and it’s not going to benefit my partners if I go in there and start yelling at people,” Calderon said.</p>\n<p>Romero said newly hired UCPD officers undergo field training alongside an experienced officer.</p>\n<p>“When they get hired they are on a field training program,” Romero said. “Besides learning how to do a proper car stop, how to search somebody properly, how to place somebody into custody, we also teach them how to interact with our community, things to look for, how to be an active listener.”</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP intervenes when necessary to keep students and I.V. residents safe.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to make sure that everybody enjoys their time here out in Isla Vista and we know that they are away from home and a lot of people are away from home for the first time,” Calderon said. “It is not our greatest goal just to write people tickets for open containers of alcohol.”</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, deputies prosecute people for wrong-doings to prevent them from repeatedly acting out.</p>\n<p>“We try to prosecute that person because what we found is that when people do that to somebody — when they harm them physically, sexually assault them, that kind of thing — that almost empowers them to where they think that they can do it again and keep doing it in our community,” Calderon said. “That is why we have these people who are repeat offenders.”</p>\n<p>Romero said UCPD looks to hire officers who are community oriented.</p>\n<p>“We try to hire people here at the police department that are customer service oriented, community oriented. And when we are doing the hiring process, even some of the interview questions for getting a job here at the police department, we ask them about how do you feel about community-organized policing, can you define it for us, what does it mean to you?” Romero said.</p>\n<p>Calderon said IVFP seeks to hire “mature” and experienced individuals as deputies.</p>\n<p>“I started this business when I was little bit older, I had already had another career completely. I started this in 2002; I came on board with the Sheriff’s office but I had already done some other things,” Calderon said. “Essentially we want to make sure that the officers and deputies assigned here are mature.”</p>\n<p>Romero said Community Service Organization (CSO) student officers also work alongside UCPD and help with campus security, patrolling campus buildings, sports games and entertainment events.</p>\n<p>“They do a fabulous job of going into the community, because their peers are the students,” Romero said. “They also are an extra pair of eyes and ears for any trouble that is going on in the university campus or Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Romero said the number of officers at the UCPD station, which includes an investigation unit and dispatch center, will likely soon increase.</p>\n<p>“Currently we have 36 sworn police officers, however, that number is going to grow probably another 10 here in the near future,” Romero said.</p>\n<p>First-year communication major Mable Truong said she did not know the difference between IVFP and UCPD, and previously was not aware of the CSO program.</p>\n<p>“I would be one of the people that are confused,” Truong said. “I think I have an idea of what they do — they are the people that bring you around at night … then I just saw them last night so I thought that was really cool, and they seem really friendly, too.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Elizabeth Del Rincon said she feels safer on campus and in I.V. with a visible police presence.</p>\n<p>“Just if something bad were to happen, I feel like they would be there to go and help,” Del Rincon said.</p>\n<p>Del Rincon said she believes it is important for officers to receive training on how to work with students.</p>\n<p>“They are around students all the time so I feel like if they were to receive training it would be better,” Del Rincon said. “I see them especially at night escorting people to their dorms and stuff and I think that is really good.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year chemistry major Jill Allen said the CSO escort program is helpful and allows students to feel safer.</p>\n<p>“It makes you feel safer trying to walk from one end, especially to walk from the Chem building to I.V. in the dark. It’s not so fun,” Allen said.</p>\n<p>According to Calderon, UCPD and IVFP work together without overstepping boundaries.</p>\n<p>“It is two different jurisdictions, but in other words, we work very closely. We don’t step on each other’s toes,” Calderon said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-08/an-inside-look-on-the-roles-of-sb-peace-officers/","id":4629,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4628,4627,4626],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

F&amp;B) met for their first meeting of Fall Quarter on Monday in the UCen State Street Room.</p>\n<p>The Committee heard from six student organizations including Students for Life of America, Laughology, Mab Productions, UCSB Model United Nations (MUN), Sketch ‘N’ Sniff and the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC). A.S. F&amp;B fully funded Students for Life of America and partially funded the other five student groups.</p>\n<p>IFC Vice President of Communications Austin Hechler requested $15,000 to bring RL Grime to the Thunderdome on Nov. 10 for a benefit concert to raise funds to improve Greek Park.</p>\n<p>“If you have seen the park recently it is really run down with basketball courts that have cracks all over it, volleyball courts with weeds going everywhere,” Hechler said. “All fraternities and sororities will be represented in this park and this park is not just exclusively for Greeks; anyone who wants to host an event there can host an event there. We just want to make sure that it looks aesthetically good.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted IFC $10,000 for stage and lighting expenses and tabled the remaining $5,000, asking Hechler to return the following week to answer further questions.</p>\n<p>A representative of Students for Life of America said the group will use the $500 allocated for venue and security fees for a debate on abortion they plan to host on Oct. 21 at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p>“We are hopefully going to have a philosophical debate about abortion,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>Board member Nawar Nemeh said he is concerned only one side of the debate is advertising for the event.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it will be a problem, but we should keep in mind that the advertising is being done by one side of the issue and it is a philosophical debate on a controversial issue,” Nemeh said. “I don’t know if we can fund, like, an independent entity and can advertise for them.”</p>\n<p>But A.S. F&amp;B Assistant Director for Finance and Budgets Cindy Lopez said, the Committee should not consider the content of the group’s event when deciding whether or not to fund it.</p>\n<p>“Any decision you make on funding for any event has to be content-neutral so we don’t make decisions on what the content is of any speaker that comes here,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>Laughology President Matthew Ducket requested funding for this year’s performances including regular Saturday night shows, a possible live broadcast from Jake and Amir from College Humor and a show with comedian Moshe Kasher who appeared on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon”<em>, </em>“Conan” and “@midnight.”</p>\n<p>“We put on a free show every Saturday at 8 at Embarcadero Hall,” Ducket said. “We do that every Saturday with the exception of during Thanksgiving, dead week and finals week.”</p>\n<p>According to Ducket, A.S. has funded Laughology in previous years.</p>\n<p>“A.S. has kind of been the backbone for us, at least for the past four years that I have been part of this club,” Ducket said. “We typically get the majority of our funding from you guys and it really helps us to put on not just our shows in general but put on great shows.”</p>\n<p>A.S. F&amp;B granted Laughology $1,120 of the requested $1,570.</p>\n<p>A Mab Productions representative requested $2,500 for its 25th Annual Monologue Festival, which will take place the first or second weekend of Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“The Monologue Festival comprises a series of monologues that are written by UCSB students, performed by UCSB students and are acted by UCSB students from majors all across campus,” the representative said. “I personally directed a monologue that was written by a thermodynamics student and acted by one of the Bachelor of Fine Arts students from the Department of Theater and Dance, being an English major myself.”</p>\n<p>The representative said Mab wants to expand its reach beyond campus and the requested money would fund advertising throughout Santa Barbara in publications such as the <em>Independent</em>.</p>\n<p>“We are asking for slightly more funding for advertising to explore some things like putting an ad in the newspaper or possibly on the radio,” the representative said.</p>\n<p>Chief Financial Officer Kevin Koo said he did not want the Committee to fund high advertising costs that do not target UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“I do a lot of work in advertising and I just think this number is not very feasible,” Koo said. “I would like to see that cost lower.”</p>\n<p>A.S.

The grant for Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success (ONDAS), a Title V program, will be distributed over five years and will focus on improving student success and graduation rates by expanding educational opportunities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director of Research Development for the Social Sciences, Humanities and Fine Arts in the UCSB Office of Research Barbara Endemaño Walker said the grant will provide access to summer “enrichment” resources such as intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and the ONDAS Success Center which provide support from community scholars, peer tutoring and a designated study space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ITS we plan to use is ALEKS, which was originally developed at UC Irvine,” Walker said in an email. “It is used at several UC’s, and the UCSB Chemistry Department already uses it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Walker, 10 majors and 41 courses were found to put students at risk of probation and impeded graduation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Undergraduate students are placed on probation when their cumulative GPA drops below 2.0,” Walker said in an email. “We determined which first year courses (for both freshmen and transfer students) … have a combination of both high enrollment and the lowest final average GPA.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs and third-year history of public policy major Paola Dela Cruz said the grant will focus on first-year experiences and faculty professional development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It aims] to address the challenges of underrepresented and low-income students in certain majors and to help with the first-year retention rates,” Dela Cruz said. “That, to me, is very important because I come from a low-income community that is certainly underrepresented — I come from Compton.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walker said the ONDAS Success Center will remain active after the five-year grant program ends through financial funding sources such as grants, gifts and campus resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The grant will begin this fall,” Walker said in an email. “We will be piloting and ramping up the programs over the next year, and plan to have ONDAS fully operating by fall 2017.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double-major Mohsin Mirza said the grant will improve student life and student representation in “more competitive” majors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I ultimately hope this grant is going to help students of all backgrounds excel in majors where they traditionally have not,” Mirza said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dela Cruz said she notices her friends struggling in STEM majors such as chemical engineering and biology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of them actually changed their majors,” Dela Cruz said “One of my best friends was on academic probation because she was not excelling in those classes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dela Cruz, the grant will address issues impacting minority and marginalized groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By looking specifically at these issues, you are allowing a diverse group of individuals to feel comfortable on this campus,” Dela Cruz said. “You are trying to find alternative ways, creative ways, to make this group of students feel comfortable and make them successful individuals.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mirza said he hopes students as well as administrators will play active roles in deciding how the grant money should best be allocated to aid minority students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully, there is a maximum amount of student consultation and outreach in regards to where this money is going to be sent, in particular, with the communities with whom these grants have been issued,” Mirza said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64880\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64880\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/ucsbs-new-diversity-status-merits-2-6-million-grant/","id":2702,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2701,2700,2699],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"AB 3 Heads to Gov.

If approved, the bill will establish the CSD’s formation processes and boundaries and authorize services for I.V., including rent mediation, additional sidewalks and improved lighting.</p>\n<p>Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson presented AB 3 during the Senate session, where the bill passed with a vote of 25-14. Jackson said she and Williams are honored to represent I.V. in its path to self-governance.</p>\n<p>“The current conditions in Isla Vista have reached a breaking point and AB 3 establishes a community services district for providing critical services to the community of Isla Vista which will initially serve as a stepping stone to future stability in that community,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from Williams’ capital office, the assemblymember left Sacramento early Friday morning for Santa Barbara, arriving just in time for the birth of his first child, Ya’Ash Rene Williams. Assemblymember Lorena S. Gonzalez presented AB 3 on the Assembly floor and the passage of the bill moved forward without interruption with a vote of 48-27.</p>\n<p>“Ya’Ash, means Heaven in Navajo. Her middle name also carries a special meaning, as it was is given in honor of Assemblymember Williams’ grandfather, Rene Dietz, a current resident of Ojai,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>AB 3 would require an application to be submitted by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to review the district and place the CSD and a Utility Users Tax (UUT) on the Nov. 2016 general election ballot. The UUT would tax residents a percentage of their utility bills in order to provide funding for the district.</p>\n<p>Williams said I.V. residents have been essential to the bill’s progress during each stage of its development.</p>\n<p>“This has been one of the most community driven bills the legislature has ever seen,” Williams said in a press release. “Everything included in the bill was reviewed during weekly community stakeholder meetings and, after 45 years, Isla Vista will finally have the opportunity to vote on their own governance.”</p>\n<p>Williams’s Chief of Staff Lourdes Jimenez said the large number of residents, students and community leaders involved in the bill’s development demonstrate an environment of open dialogue and positive change.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64710\" style=\"width: 1223px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-64710\" data-attachment-id=\"64710\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/santa-barbara-ad-aims-to-rebrand-isla-vista/ab3_by-eric-swenson-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=1213%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1213,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AB3_by Eric Swenson-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-64710 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AB3_by-Eric-Swenson-1.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"If passed, AB3 will promote stability where it is currently lacking in the Isla Vista community.

Youth Projects, and the IVRPD,” Jimenez said in an email. “The community process has provided the opportunity for Isla Vistans to connect with one another and has brought together pockets of the community that might not usually interact.</p>\n<p>According to Jimenez, AB 3 community meetings will continue every Tuesday from 6 to 8 p.m. in the conference room of the I.V.

Yang and other university administrators Friday morning in the UCen’s State Street room to discuss UCSB’s handling of sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>At the forum, students worked with administrators to clarify the 13 demands Melgoza, Vasquez and Weyrick made at the May 13 sit-in in Yang’s office. Attendees had the opportunity to ask questions of the campaign leaders and participating administrators regarding current sexual assault policies and the 13 demands.</p>\n<p>UCSB Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment and Title IX Compliance Director Ricardo Alcaino said the office cannot hire staff based on race or gender, but hopes to create a more diverse staff to fulfill the 11th demand.</p>\n<p>“We cannot select individuals due to their race or gender, we can’t do that, but we definitely can cast very broad nets and make sure our pools are very diverse so naturally, obviously, we will be more likely get a diverse candidate,” Alcaino said.</p>\n<p>Off-campus Senator and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Melgoza said the fifth demand calls for the creation of an Associated Students Survivor Fund to cover medical, travel, housing and other expenses for survivors of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“We are making sure that those funds are available to students and that students know these funds are available to them, because, often times, survivors have expenses, particularly for housing,” Melgoza said. “They want to move out of their living space, especially if it is out in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>According to Gaucho Consent Co-Chair, Take Back the Night Executive Board member and second-year sociology major Weyrick, the A.S. Survivor Fund would come from donations and would not increase student fees.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t coming from student fees, this doesn’t raise tuition or anything like that,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>Weyrick said availability of an A.S. Survivor Fund would not lead to false accusations of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“I really do not think there would be any kind of people that would want to first go through this and abuse these funds,” Weyrick said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza said Yang supports further examination of the second demand, which would increase the minimum suspension from one quarter to four quarters for students found guilty of sexual assault.</p>\n<p>“The university still has to look into the legalities of that, and that is actually higher up, that is not something we can just do as a campus, so the Chancellor has given his support for a recommendation to pass that on,” Melgoza said.</p>\n<p>Melgoza said the third demand states the university must remove sexual assault perpetrators from university housing, employment or organizations.</p>\n<p>“Often times, immediate removal from housing doesn’t happen,” Melgoza said. “It is very interesting how students are removed from housing for playing loud music … but when it is about interpersonal violence it is not often talked about.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Police Department (UCPD) Detective Dawn Arviso said UCPD Chief Dustin Olson wants his staff to reflect the student body and supports the sixth demand, which aims to increase the number of women serving in local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“Chief Olson is really big on having a diverse department that represents all of campus,” Arviso said. “We are really excited about that and most of those female officers and certainly a handful of male officers have expressed an interest in working with these types of crimes.”</p>\n<p>Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA) Assistant Dean of Student Life Suzanne Perkin said she needs further information regarding the eighth demand, calling for a method for students to evaluate and share their experiences with OJA.</p>\n<p>“We need something formal,” Perkin said. “Like here is an email that I got that was insensitive or here is an interaction that I had on this date that didn’t sit well with me or something like that. Something very concrete instead of just ‘it was mishandled.’”</p>\n<p>According to Weyrick, students who have bad experiences with OJA should be able to give a detailed report.</p>\n<p>“That is going to take time and trust for students,” Weyrick said, “It is not a grievance thing. It is a legitimate concern with how their case was handled, with who they were working with, so there would of course be solid like some sort of information something to relay, it would be specifics.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-06-01/administrators-students-discuss-sexual-assault-case-procedures/","id":2737,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2736,2735,2734],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Isla Vista Remembers May 23rd","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"The Associated Students Program Board (ASPB) will host the Candlelight Vigil and Memorial Walk this Saturday in Storke Plaza as part of a series of events in remembrance of the events of May 23 last y...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Community to observe anniversary of last year’s tragedy with Candlelight Vigil and Memorial Walk</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_63671\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63671\" data-attachment-id=\"63671\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/isla-vista-remembers-may-23rd/vigil-anniversary_nexus-file-photo-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1400962711\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Vigil Anniversary_Nexus File Photo-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63671\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Vigil-Anniversary_Nexus-File-Photo-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Students and community members alike gathered in Isla Vista last May in the wake of the events.

<em>Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>­­­</p>\n<p>Residence halls Multicultural Awareness Chairs held a discussion Wednesday titled “Where Are We Now?” to explore students’ healing processes following the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>The Multicultural Awareness Chairs chose the theme “You Can Sit with Us” to foster inclusive discussion. Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) Training Director Juan Riker led a discussion in which students shared feelings on the upcoming May 23 anniversary and the May 11 Sabado Tarde Road incident. Students signed chalkboards as a symbol of solidarity.</p>\n<p>San Rafael Hall Multicultural Awareness Chair and second-year sociology major Curnishia Woodbury said freshman students are often alienated from the rest of the UCSB community because they did not experience the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“There is this empathy gap between us and the freshmen who are new here,” Woodbury said.</p>\n<p>According to Woodbury, open discussions are important because they expose how past events continue to affect people’s lives.</p>\n<p>“Problems are still here,” Woodbury said. “Spring Quarter last year, it was like everybody said ‘how are you?’ but Fall Quarter rolls around and everybody is back to like ‘Hey, I.V., let’s go party.’ They are still perpetuating the same problems that existed before.”</p>\n<p>Woodbury said the group also addressed why society tends to shame men who express their feelings, discussing what it means to be masculine and how society is “perpetuating” a male-dominated society.</p>\n<p>“I hoped that people would keep the dialogue going, keep talking about what masculinity means — what does femininity mean?” Woodbury said. “What are we doing here in this I.V. community? Why do we still perpetuate these same norms when we could change it after what happened?”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Women tend to be diagnosed with depression, whereas men tend to externalize versus internalize their feelings. – C.A.P.S. Training Director Juan Riker</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Riker, attendees discussed how women share emotions more frequently and are more likely to be diagnosed with depression.</p>\n<p>“Women tend to be diagnosed with depression, whereas men tend to externalize versus internalize their feelings,” Riker said.</p>\n<p>Riker said C.A.P.S. encourages students to seek out counseling services during the week of May 23.</p>\n<p>“It is important to stress support and not being alone,” Woodbury said.</p>\n<p>Riker said his repressed emotions from the events of May 23 last year may have been triggered by the May 11 Sabado Tarde Road incident.</p>\n<p>“Clearly, that shook all of us — just wrapping our minds around that happening again,” Riker said.</p>\n<p>Second-year black studies and sociology double major Chika Anyiw said the chalkboards students signed will be displayed at San Rafael and Manzanita Residence Halls.</p>\n<p>“The purpose of the chalkboards is to distribute them, have one be in San Rafael somewhere and the other one be in Manzanita by the central front desk it and if not give it to OSL [Office of Student Life] and then OSL would choose to place it somewhere on campus,” Anyiw said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, May 14, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63414\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-14/talk-encourages-students-to-heal-share-emotions/","id":2749,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2748,2747,2746],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Governance Board could potentially manage the Pardall Center if A.S. does not establish a special administration.</p>\n<p>“I would imagine that these future spaces would have somewhat of a different charge, and if they don’t, then maybe this existing committee could manage spaces with similar missions,” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>The committee tabled the bill to allow senators more time to become familiar with its language, according to Moreh.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that is pretty big since we are creating something, and I just wouldn’t want anyone to come and say, ‘I don’t feel as though there was enough time for senators to look at it,’” Moreh said. “We want to create something that is going to be a model that we can work under for years to come.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said a temporary committee comprised of members of I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU), I.V. Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) and Pardall Center staff members will continue to hold meetings Mondays at 4 p.m. beginning May 11 in the conference room of the Pardall Center to discuss the facility’s administration.</p>\n<p>“The way that the [committee] was made was so that anyone could join and become a voting member. Ideally, we would have advertised that, but we didn’t have enough time to get the word out,” Moreh said. “Anyone can come — it is an open meeting — but those are the people currently discussing it.”</p>\n<p>According to Moreh, the committee tabled the bill to allow for the inclusion of amendments that give IVTU and the Legal Resource Center autonomy as renting tenants of the Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>“IVTU and LRC want to be able to have as much autonomy as possible since they are tenants and they should have the ability to run their own space,” Moreh said. “They are on the board, but we also guaranteed them that there would be something in this legislation that would say they have autonomy.”</p>\n<p>EAC sent A Bill to Create the Standing Policies &amp; Procedures of the Pardall Center of The Standing Policies and Procedures of the A.S. UCSB to the consent calendar.</p>\n<p>A Bill to Create Policy 35 will foster more connections between A.S. and I.V., according to Moreh.</p>\n<p>“It is hard because the only one is Pardall Center right now,” Moreh said. “The point is to eventually have so many different paths.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said the bill lays out the expectations, behaviors, parking, advertising and other “dos and don’ts” for use of the Pardall Center.</p>\n<p>“It is important to have because we have had some issues in the Pardall Center and, like any public space, there needs to be a set of policies that governs this space so that we can enforce respectful behavior,” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>After discussing both bills, EAC moved to a discussion on campaigns to address tuition hikes and the upcoming Week of Healing to remember the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>First-year political science and Asian American studies double major Akshaya Natarajan said A.S. is using the “Dear Governor Brown” campaign and a recently released online petition to combat tuition hikes</p>\n<p>“The petition is specifically asking Governor Brown to commit to invest $100 million in the UC system which would freeze tuition which would offset tuition hikes,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>Natarajan also discussed “We’re Fucked,” a project to publicize problems caused by state disinvestment in higher education.</p>\n<p>“Our tuition is going up, we aren’t able to pay for very basic necessities, our little brothers and little sisters won’t be able to go to college,” Natarajan said.</p>\n<p>According to Natarajan, A.S. will soon table, host a panel discussion with faculty, share student testimonials and distribute t-shirts to educate students about Dear Governor Brown.</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major and Off-campus Senator Paola Dela Cruz said there will be an art gallery, memorial garden and other installments for the Week of Healing.</p>\n<p>“The Parks District worked closely with the families, they made sure each bench was designed to represent each student,” Dela Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Representative-at-large Senator Victor Garcia said the Residence Halls Association (RHA) is participating in BLUNITE, a memorial art installment made up of blue LED lights.</p>\n<p>“RHA has actually bought 300 LED lights for each [residence] hall — so around like 2,700 lights — and they’re going to be distributed at each front desk so residents can come and pick up a light and put a light on their windowsill,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>EAC Chair and third-year anthropology major Carlos Lopez concluded the meeting with information about the AB 3 Sacramento Lobby Day this Wednesday. According to Lopez, organizers plan to bring I.V. residents to Sacramento to promote Assemblymember Das Williams’ I.V. self-governance bill, AB 3, before its hearing in the California State Assembly Committee on Local Government.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to get at least 20 people to go up there to honestly show there is community-supported favor of AB 3 instead of just homeowners — who are going to drive up there because they don’t have school — to say that they don’t want it, or people that are opposed to it in general,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally quoted Michelle Moreh as saying “this existing committee could manage spaces with similar commissions,” however the correct quote reads “this existing committee could manage spaces with similar missions.” The article also stated the EAC could potentially manage the Pardall Center, while Moreh in fact said an A.S. in I.V. Governance Board could be created to potentially manage the Pardall Center. The article said this was the first EAC meeting, but the committee has met on previous Mondays at 4 p.m. In addition, Moreh said the bill was tabled to allow for the inclusion of amendments to give IVTU and the Legal Resource Center the majority of power, when the amendments actually allowed IVTU and the Legal Resource Center autonomy as renting tenants.]</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated as of 11:23 p.m. on May 12, 2015.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63266\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/a-s-external-affairs-committee-talks-tuition-hikes-bills-self-governance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63266\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/a-s-external-affairs-committee-talks-tuition-hikes-bills-self-governance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/a-s-external-affairs-committee-talks-tuition-hikes-bills-self-governance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/a-s-external-affairs-committee-talks-tuition-hikes-bills-self-governance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-08/a-s-external-affairs-committee-talks-tuition-hikes-bills-self-governance/","id":2778,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2777,2776,2775],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Proxies are defined as temporary stand-ins for Senators unable attend Senate meetings who must be approved by the Board of Directors and are able to vote for the absent Senator, according to the A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>“Senator proxies cannot be people that have declared their candidacy to run in any on-going elections,” Santos said. “I added in this highlighted piece that says Senator proxies cannot be current executives.”</p>\n<p>According to On-Campus Senator and second-year religious studies and philosophy double major Jennifer Liem, the Fraternity and Sorority Council changed their name to the Multicultural Greek Council, so Article VI of the A.S.

Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“You can tag pages to A.S. UCSB and apparently we have a Wikipedia,” Mancini said. “Associated Students didn’t know that. I was going to add to the bill once I think about this for a little bit, how to have everyone have this community page about A.S. UCSB.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

LEDs in the early ’90s. <em>McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Nobel Laureate and UC Santa Barbara materials and electrical and computer engineering professor Shuji Nakamura gave a talk on his Nobel Prize-winning research on blue light-emitting diodes last night in Campbell hall.</p>\n<p>Nakamura spoke on how his research in developing blue LEDs has allowed lighting technology, among other things, to become much more efficient and environmentally friendly. Nakamura began studying LEDs when researching and publishing papers on the scarcely studied compound GaN for his Ph.D. and eventually invented the blue LED and white LED in 1993. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Nakamura the Nobel Prize in physics in 2014 alongside Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano, who contributed to his findings.</p>\n<blockquote><p>He has opened the door to affordable energy efficient lighting for every person in every nation — a monumental contribution to all of humankind. – Chancellor Henry T. Yang</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang began the talk by introducing Nakamura, praising his achievements and contributions to UCSB.</p>\n<p>“He was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics not just for inventing the best blue laser, but for being the first to create the brightest blue light, using indium gallium nitride,” Yang said. “Fast-forward to the year 2000, UC Santa Barbara was incredibly fortunate to have Shuji join our campus. His hire was like mounting the jewel in the semiconductor crown at UC Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>Yang said he thinks Nakamura’s LED will one day replace Thomas Edison’s lightbulb.</p>\n<p>“We are all here to witness first-hand the brilliance of professor Shuji Nakamura and his blue LED,” Yang said. “He has opened the door to affordable energy efficient lighting for every person in every nation — a monumental contribution to all of humankind.”</p>\n<p>Nakamura began his talk with the history of LED lighting, from growing high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) crystals in 1991, to developing blue LEDs in 1994 and up to the present. The revolution in generating white light, achieved by combining blue light with a yellow phosphor, enables energy-efficient lighting, displays, medicine and the next generation of Blu-ray optical storage, according to Nakamura.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62888\" style=\"width: 264px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62888\" data-attachment-id=\"62888\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-29/nakamura-speaks-on-leds/shujinakamura_mclane-brown-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"400,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL SL1\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430250533\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ShujiNakamura_McLane Brown-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?fit=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62888\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2-167x250.jpg?resize=254%2C380\" alt=\"McLane Brown/Daily Nexus\" width=\"254\" height=\"380\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ShujiNakamura_McLane-Brown-2.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">McLane Brown/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“To make the white color, you get the blue color and the yellow color and they make white. This is only two colors so it is cheaper,” Nakamura said, “I invented the blue LED 23 years ago, so since that time many people have told me ‘oh you will get the Nobel Prize,’ but it took 23 years.”</p>\n<p>According to Nakamura, his inventions will allow the world to generate 185,000 fewer tons of carbon dioxide by 2030.</p>\n<p>“Lighting accounts for 35 percent of energy consumption in California,” Nakamura said. “By 2030, 46 percent of electricity is saved.”</p>\n<p>Yang quoted 2000 physics Nobel Prize laureate and UCSB professor Emeritus Herbert Kroemer, who was not in attendance, to describe Nakamura’s impact.</p>\n<p>“Nakamura was the one who made the breakthrough, period,” Yang said. “End of the statement. And no one else was near that breakthrough. Shuji would win the Nobel when LED lightbulbs had replaced Thomas Edison’s incandescent bulbs at Costco.”</p>\n<p>Haruna Morohoshi, a representative from Soraa, the LED manufacturer founded by UCSB professors Nakamura, Steven DenBaars and James Speck, said it took time for the world time recognize the potential in LED lighting.</p>\n<p>“Most consumers don’t understand the energy saving aspect … how much you save every month,” Morohoshi said. “It takes a lot longer for consumers to realize the value of LEDs. I think that’s why 20 years after he invented it, he finally got the Nobel Prize. The world is finally recognizing the value of LED lighting.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and accounting major Hajime Okamoto said he was intrigued by Nakamura’s research and speech.</p>\n<p>“It was great and he was funny,” Okamoto said. “I had to come here because I was really interested.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Recently, Jackson and Williams have both introduced legislation geared toward ending sexual violence on college campuses.</p>\n<p>Event coordinator Gregory Jarrett said the Capps Center does not endorse specific politicians or legislation but denounces sexual assault as an ethical issue.</p>\n<p>“We are decidedly not neutral on ethics and we do not feign indifference to the fact that this is a profoundly neglected problem not just for the survivors of sexual assault, but for all women and their Title IX right to an equal education and equal protection under the law,” Jarrett said.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson it is currently unsafe for women to walk alone around college campuses, the very environments which are supposed to foster the education of the “future leaders of our state.”</p>\n<p>“According to the Department of Justice, 1 in 5 college women experience rape or attempted rape during their time as a student, and we know that less than five percent of all rapes and attempted rapes are reported,” Jackson said. “I believe we have a duty to continue to transform the culture on our campuses and make them safer environments for our students.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62754\" style=\"width: 332px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62754\" data-attachment-id=\"62754\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-26/representatives-discuss-sexual-assault-policy-culture/hbj-and-dw_christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,399\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429821915\",\"copyright\":\"Kenneth Song\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"2500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"HBJ and DW_Christina DeMarzo-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-62754\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2-250x166.jpg?resize=322%2C214\" alt=\"Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus\" width=\"322\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HBJ-and-DW_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Jackson, who joint-authored Senate Bill 967 — popularly known as the “Yes Means Yes” law — last year, said the now-passed legislation can affect change if the language in the bill is appropriately enforced.</p>\n<p>“Only ‘yes’ means ‘yes,’ and it requires college campuses to educate students about consent and sexual assault,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Jackson said various types of media, such as YouTube videos, trivialize sexual assault and rape and schools need to counter this message with education.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, university disciplinary codes should be strong enough to adequately penalize perpetrators of sexual assault, because survivors often do not want to involve law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“This is criminal conduct and if we cannot find you guilty of a crime;

Food Co-op, I was aware of many food justice issues but failed to eat locally and organically with my very tight budget. I now believe that living cooperatively is the solution to make organic, local food financially sustainable.”</p>\n<p>According to Ngo, as a shopper for Merton, she hopes to change her housemates’ routine of shopping for groceries based on price.</p>\n<p>“I’m attending this talk is because I am currently a food shopper for our house, Merton Co-op, and I would like to deepen my understanding of the issue so that I can educate my housemates,” Ngo said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62635\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62635\" data-attachment-id=\"62635\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-24/community-discusses-food-systems-sustainability/tedx_paris-cullen-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1429641325\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"27\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"TEDx_Paris Cullen-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-62635 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TEDx_Paris-Cullen-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62635\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Ngo said she provides 18 people at the Merton House with organic foods for $100 per month to benefit the local economy as well as the environment which, according to her, is advantageous for multiple reasons.</p>\n<p>“Sharing food with 18 other college students provide us the buying capital to support our local farmers and businesses while reducing food waste and carbon foot print,” Ngo said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Nancy Yang, representing the university’s proposed Food Cart Working Group, discussed a program seeking to launch food carts on campus serving produce from local farmers and vendors.</p>\n<p>“The seeds for this project were really planted about five years ago by a group of students who saw that there was definitely an option for an alternative meal on campus that sought to launch a food cart that was student run,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, students have voiced a need for more healthy and organic options on campus.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to really show both campus leaders and administrators — as well as other orgs — we could partner with that this is something students want,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>EAB Community Food Impact Coordinator Biby Landaverde discussed a sustainable cooking competition hosted by EAB weekly to encourage cooking creatively using simple ingredients.

What we are trying to do now is to make our service more holistic.
