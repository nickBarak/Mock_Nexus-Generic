Santa Barbara startups will be hiring for job positions and internships within sales, marketing, business development, engineering, human resources and more.</p>\n<p>The UCSB EA President Navjot Brar, fourth-year mechanical engineering major, said the organization expects 500 people to attend throughout the day. After speaking with a previous president of the Cal Poly Entrepreneurs Club, Brar thought a career fair could help UCSB students as well.</p>\n<p>“The Startup Career Fair was just a perfect way to help students … After talking to multiple startups in town, they all voiced their concern that they needed to hire UCSB students. That got me thinking, ‘Well that’s weird, I know a ton of students looking for jobs at UCSB,’” Brar said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Brar, EA “created some hurdles” to ensure that companies will engage with students for immediate hiring rather than simply increase the reach of their company.</p>\n<p>“I always hated going to other career fairs and hearing the big companies tell me to just apply online. These guys want to hire UCSB students immediately and for the summer,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>Currently there are 15 Santa Barbara companies attending: Procore, Appfolio, Invoca, LogicMonitor, Graphiq, BioIQ, cielo24, Aurrion, Impact Radius, Brazyn Life, TrackR, Oniracom, FluidStance, PayJunction and Bitwage.</p>\n<p>Jiana Vargem, EA outreach officer and third-year psychology major, is in the process of completing the Technology Management Program certificate. Vargem will be volunteering as an EA member at the fair but said she will also use the event as an opportunity to network.</p>\n<p>“In January EA put on a Startup competition that is going to become an annual event so I cannot see why this wouldn’t,” Vargem said in an email. “We all are stressing out about graduating and employment, so why not maximize our opportunities for future hire?”</p>\n<p>Josh Barney, Chief Operating Officer for the UCSB EA and third-year statistical science major, will also be attending the event.</p>\n<p>“I have been contacting startup companies local to the Central Coast in order to bring them to the event. I think this will become an annual fair since everyone on our leadership team wants to continue the event for future years. Also the involvement of students in entrepreneurship has never been better,” Barney said in an email.</p>\n<p>Attendees are encouraged to bring a student I.D. or perm number and resume copies.

faculty hiring committees and has drafted a resolution to be included in the hiring process.</p>\n<p>When hiring new faculty members, academic departments first select candidates and send the final decision to a vote from the entire university faculty, including professors, assistant professors and lecturers.</p>\n<p>GSA’s resolution will ask that at least two graduate students be allowed as members of the hiring committee, with access to all necessary materials for making informed decisions. Graduate students of the department will democratically elect the two representatives, according to Yanira Rivas Pineda, graduate student and GSA’s Vice President of External Affairs.</p>\n<p>“We think that a minimum of two students should be included in the hiring process,” Pineda said in an email. “To have only one student and the rest of the committee members be faculty might be intimidating for a student.”</p>\n<p>Pineda said graduate students work closely with faculty as their research assistants, teaching assistants and mentees and it is important for graduate students to understand the faculty hiring process.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69774\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69774\" data-attachment-id=\"69774\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-11/gsa-resolution-aims-to-include-graduate-students-in-faculty-hiring-committees/gsa-lounge-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"GSA Lounge\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-69774\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3-1024x682.jpg?resize=450%2C300\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GSA-Lounge_by-Jenny-Luo-3.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-69774\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It helps with our professional development because we get to learn first-hand what the hiring process looks like, how to craft competitive [curriculum vitaes], teaching statements, and what faculty are looking for in prospective applicants,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>By drafting the proposal, UCSB is joining a system-wide effort through the UC Student Association Graduate and Professional Committee.</p>\n<p>In August 2014, the Graduate and Professional Committee of UCSA adopted the Graduate Students Democratizing Education (GrADE) campaign. According to Pineda, UC Berkeley’s GSA drafted and passed a resolution in favor of GrADE and other UC graduate students hope to pass similar resolutions.</p>\n<p>“The campaign … addressed problems with the lack of faculty diversity (in all forms), finding adequate mentorship and faculty with research projects that reflect the 21st century graduate population,” Pineda said in an email.</p>\n<p>Iman Sylvain, UC Berkeley’s Graduate Assembly Vice President of External Affairs, said she helped write a resolution that endorses the full and permanent participation of graduate students in faculty hiring processes with equal rights to interview and provide input as faculty.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem.” — Timothy Irvine</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The UC acknowledges that it lags behind peer institutions in hiring women and underrepresented minorities,” Pineda said in an email. “We believe that having the next generation of faculty (those of us being trained to become professors) being part of the hiring process is [a] small but necessary step in democratizing the hiring process and our university.”</p>\n<p>According to Timothy Irvine, GSA’s Vice President of Committees and Planning and graduate student, a small percentage of tenured or tenured-track faculty are African American. He said having younger, more diverse people involved in hiring committees would play an important role in increasing diversity.</p>\n<p>“This is 50 years after Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Act and somehow we still don’t have very many professors of color — kind of a problem,” Irvine said. “Hiring committees are a big part of the solution to that problem.”</p>\n<p>Irvine also said having graduate students who are being taught by faculty on these committees would be a “very logical next step towards shared governance” between students and universities.</p>\n<p>Irvine said UCSB’s current system is “decentralized” and graduate student voices are heard differently in each department’s hiring process.</p>\n<p>“That is done in the name of academic freedom, but what you also get is like a patchwork of adherence to different conduct codes and legal codes,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Some GSA members expressed concern about the change creating too much pressure for graduate students who find themselves in disagreement with department faculty. Others questioned whether graduate students should have voting powers.</p>\n<p>“I believe that these concerns are precisely why we need to include graduate students in the hiring process,” Pineda said in an email. “Those of us who are going to stay in the academy should be able to experience the hiring process from the other side and not just when we’re out in the job market.”</p>\n<p>GSA members are in the process of modifying their initial draft, and will bring the resolution to a vote during a General Assembly Meeting on May 3.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this story misquoted Timothy Irvine as saying “Human Rights Act” instead of “Civil Rights Act.” The article has been updated accordingly. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The resolution, titled “A Resolution of the City Council of the City of Goleta, California Establishing Temporary Resident Only On-Street Parking Restrictions Related to the 2016 Isla Vista Deltopia Event,” will be in place from 9 a.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday during Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>Although Deltopia is expected to occur the weekend of April 2, City staff requested authorization to implement the parking restrictions for the weekends of April 2 and April 9 to allow for flexibility should the date change.</p>\n<p>Last Deltopia, Goleta implemented a temporary ban on street parking on certain high-traffic blocks of I.V. Based on a survey of residents and testimonies of law enforcement and City personnel following the weekend, City staff concluded temporary parking restrictions are effective and meet residents’ needs.</p>\n<p>Deputy City Clerk Liana Campos presented the City staff’s report recommending City Council pass the resolution.</p>\n<p>The report calls on UCSB to encourage students to park on campus while the restrictions are in place.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is expected to take the same measures for this spring’s event. To help dissuade partygoers from parking in the Goleta neighborhoods closest to Isla Vista during the Deltopia event,” the staff report said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68720\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68720\" data-attachment-id=\"68720\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-02/goleta-city-council-to-restrict-parking-during-deltopia-weekend/deltopia-parking-city-council_by-lorenzo-basilio-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Deltopia Parking City Council\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-68720\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2-1024x684.jpg?resize=800%2C534\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deltopia-Parking-City-Council_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>According to the report, over the past two years, the date for Deltopia has the potential to change very quickly with the use of social media.</p>\n<p>“Deltopia is not to be confused with a series of sanctioned UCSB events generally known as “Spring Warm Up” that occur in the same time period,” the report said. “Potentially upwards of 25,000 people could pass through Goleta for this Isla Vista event.”</p>\n<p>The parking restriction area would have the boundaries of Cannon Green Drive to the west, Hollister Avenue to the north, Storke Road to the east and Whittier Drive to the south — making up the Goleta neighborhoods known as University 1 and University 2.</p>\n<p>“Parking permits would be required to be taped to the inside of the vehicle’s driver’s side window during the restricted hours,” the report said. “Vehicles found parked on any of the streets in the University 1-2 neighborhoods during the restricted times, not displaying the appropriate parking permit, would be subject to ticketing and/or towing.”</p>\n<p>The recommendation to the City passed unanimously and I.V. residencies will be mailed two parking permits each.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

A portion of S.A.G.E.’s revenue would go to financial aid for students under the UC system’s return-to-aid policy. At the meeting, UCSB students were able to ask questions and voice their opinions on the proposal.</p>\n<p>Currently, UCSA’s work runs on membership dues collected by most campuses’ undergraduate and graduate or professional student associations, with supplemental support from the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and grants for program initiatives.</p>\n<p>Mohsin Mirza, External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and fourth-year black studies and sociology double major, discussed UCSA’s work. Mirza said he believes S.A.G.E. is a good solution to the financial challenges UCSA faces.</p>\n<p>“S.A.G.E. is just one of many solutions we can look at, but it is certainly a very viable one right now,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Sabo said the organization works to represent all UC students and connect with groups that have similar goals.</p>\n<p>“We represent all undergrads, grads and professional students before the legislature and legislator advocacy in front of the Regents and UC advocacy,” Sabo said “We do a lot of on-campus organizing connecting with different nonprofits or local groups that do a lot of work on the same issues that we do as well.”</p>\n<p>Sabo said the UCSA maintains close relations with California State University (CSU) and California Community College students.</p>\n<p>“We are a quarter of a million students. We work very closely with the CSU Students Association, which has about half a million students, and with the Community College Students Association, which has about two and a half million students,” Sabo said.</p>\n<p>Mirza said there are a number of campaigns UCSA runs every year, such as working to increase the number of student voters.</p>\n<p>“That is how we get people to listen to us and pay attention to what we are saying. So every year we register a significant amount of voters,” Mirza said. “Back in 2012 we registered over 50,000 voters, and that had a really big impact on the work we were doing.”</p>\n<p>According to Mirza, UCSA’s “Fund the UC” campaign aims to fight tuition hikes caused by budget cuts.</p>\n<p>“A big reason why you are paying more tuition is because funding for the University has been decreased over a significant period in the last 20 years, but beyond that ever since the recession we have seen huge budget cuts to our University,” Mirza said.</p>\n<p>Sabo said S.A.G.E. will promote the advocacy by and for UC students and increase students’ ability compete with large, well-funded and well-organized special interests in Sacramento. Sabo said UC-student advocacy is currently a “pay to play” system, something S.A.G.E. aims to fix.</p>\n<p>“You get to participate to the extent that you can pay for it, which is sort of counter intuitive to the UC’s mission, which is why we have started talking about S.A.G.E.,” Sabo said. “Unfortunately, tuition is going up and so we have to make sure that our voices are heard in that process too when it comes to the budget.”</p>\n<p>Sabo said UCSA hopes to get more UC students to Sacramento to testify and lobby lawmakers in order to prove their investment in state politics.</p>\n<p>“They look at students and they say ‘students don’t vote, they don’t come to visit, so I can continue to screw them over without any consequence, because I will just get re-elected to office because they have short-term memories,’” Sabo said.</p>\n<p>UCSA Communications Director Anaïs LaVoie said campus discussions like Thursday’s help UCSA gather valuable feedback regarding S.A.G.E.</p>\n<p>“We have been here four times now. We are really trying to talk to as many students as possible,” LaVoie said. “This is not a final proposal by any means. We are still developing it.”</p>\n<p>According to LaVoie, UCSA is working to make S.A.G.E. as transparent as possible.</p>\n<p>“Even if it is different on each campus, how can we make sure that every single student sees something that says, ‘hey, you are paying this to UCSA and you have the right to opt-out’ before they pay the fee?” LaVoie said.</p>\n<p>Third-year physics major Liam Stanton said he is skeptical students will choose to fund S.A.G.E. if given the option to opt out.</p>\n<p>“Guarantee you it isn’t just going to be five to eight percent of students who are going to say no,” Stanton said. “There are going to be a lot of students.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

appropriation in today’s society. <em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The MultiCultural Center hosted a faculty-led panel discussion Tuesday evening to discuss cultural appropriation in today’s society.</p>\n<p>The panelists addressed critical issues and nuances between cultural appropriation, appreciation and assimilation. The event was followed by a fashion show highlighting culturally honored representations of self.</p>\n<p>Sociology professor and panel moderator Kum-Kum Bhavnani said culture does not reside within a person or group, but is defined by relationships.</p>\n<p>“The culture is created through our relationships with people … it isn’t a commodity that sits inside of us,” Bhavnani said. “Once you accept that, then you have to say, ‘Well what do we do about culture?’”</p>\n<p>Chican@ studies professor Micaela Diaz-Sanchez said intersectionality should propel this conversation.</p>\n<p>“When we are talking about the appropriation of race with regard to fashion, we should also always be thinking about gender and sexuality and class,” Diaz-Sanchez said. “Who is wearing what, in what context, and by whom is what we are wearing made?”</p>\n<p>English professor Felice Blake said Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned a colorblind world where people could exist in harmony and their “racial differences, appearances, etc. would not be a basis for discrimination.”</p>\n<p>According to Blake, Martin Luther King Jr.’s idea of colorblindness differs from the modern versions widely adopted today.</p>\n<p>“So more often than not, the argument for color blindness usually used to say, ‘Things are fair, everyone take the test and the scores will tell us who is the smart ones, who is deserving, who is worthy — and forget about the past,’” Blake said. “‘It is the people who keep bringing up race that causes the race problem. Aren’t we all supposed to be color blind?’”</p>\n<p>Blake said an important aspect of privilege is ensuring that someone does not feel they have encouraged a system of dominance.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to keep in mind the ways that someone can have privilege without feeling as if they have taken personally a part in producing a system of dominance,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>According to Blake, people oftentimes associate privilege with unearned advantage.</p>\n<p>“Advantages that one has, unearned, simply by virtue of the fact of how one was born — but those advantages come because someone else is receiving some unearned disadvantages at the same time,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>Blake said the reality of inequality is that one does not have to commit a heinous brutality against someone of color to participate in a system that is racist.</p>\n<p>“If you didn’t know before you got here: Sorry, the United States is a racist country,” Blake said.</p>\n<p>Blake said while not every use of appropriation is a violent and cruel practice, one must be open to see when cultural appropriation can be offensive.</p>\n<p>“This isn’t to say that every single instance is an appropriation and is menacing and is a racist practice,” Blake said. “When is it a question of borrowing and exchange, and when is it a question of theft?”</p>\n<p>After the discussion, the fashion show began, featuring outfits from Afghanistan, Nigeria, Columbia, Palestine, Mexico, West Africa, Vietnam and Kazakhstan.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68552\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68552\" data-attachment-id=\"68552\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-24/faculty-panel-discusses-cultural-appropriation/cultural-appropriation-panel-_by-effie-sklavenitis-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cultural Appropriation Panel _by Effie Sklavenitis-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68552\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cultural-Appropriation-Panel-_by-Effie-Sklavenitis-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-68552\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Effie Sklavenitis / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>MCC Programmer Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman said she was grateful individuals could use this event to showcase their individual cultures and heritage.</p>\n<p>“We are so grateful for our incredible models … who are representing their own cultures, heritages, ethnicities and identities,” Mohsenian-Rahman said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Amanda Becerra and participant in the fashion show said she was proud of her Columbian culture but finds it hard to find other students at UCSB who share the same culture.</p>\n<p>“I grew up with Columbian culture.

According to Marez, many farm workers have started social justice movements to combat inequalities created by corporate capitalism and government policies. Marez’s talk was the last lecture in the MCC’s Race Matters Series.</p>\n<p>Associate Professor in the Chican@ Studies Department Dolores Inés Casillas introduced Marez and said she has appreciated his writing since he was president of the American Studies Association.</p>\n<p>“I am excited to see him on our campus,” Casillas said. “Something that is really dear to my heart is that Curtis is the first person whose work I read. I read an article by him, and it was the first time I felt I had to email the person and tell them this was an incredible piece of writing.”</p>\n<p>Casillas said Marez’s hometown of Turlock, California is present in his writing and adds to his understanding of farming in the Central Valley.</p>\n<p>“He references not just the Central Valley, but in a way in which we understand that farm hands have created and cultivated a specific culture in the Central Valley,” Casillas said.</p>\n<p>According to Marez, farm workers have been leaders in visionary thinking about the future of technology, but little is known of their work.</p>\n<p>“One index of farm worker exploitation is the fact that they have often been the objects, but rarely the subjects of media representation,” Marez said. “There is a vast archive of photos and films of farm workers, but there are far fewer well-known examples of visual media produced by them.”</p>\n<p>Marez said California farm workers unions have organized and created their own media to fight agribusiness domination of visual technology.</p>\n<p>“Farm workers have undermined agribusiness representations of workers as mere machines of production, by themselves mobilizing media technologies,” Marez said. “Appropriations of cameras and other visual technologies by farm worker unions have both material and symbolic force, making exploitation visible while simultaneously seizing the means of visual reproduction.”</p>\n<p>Marez showed attendees a clip of Cesar Chavez dancing to remind them of the utopian, world-changing arc of the farm worker’s movement. Cesar Chavez, American farm worker and labor rights activist, founded the United Farm Workers (UFW).</p>\n<p>“We are used to seeing Chavez in a serious mode,” Marez said. “Just remember that he was a person who danced, who had desires for pleasure and pursued those desires I think is something that is important. Part of what I wanted to talk about today is the utopian future orientation of United Farm Workers in what I am calling <em>Farm Worker: Futurism</em>.”</p>\n<p>According to Marez, his book is an interdisciplinary study of the material and symbolic significance of technology in conflicts between agribusiness corporations and workers of color in California from the 1940s to present day.</p>\n<p>“An important practical and symbolic means of exploiting and disciplining labor [and] agribusiness technology also became the medium and object of struggle over the future of California agriculture and the larger cultural and political context supporting it,” Marez said.</p>\n<p>Marez said farm workers have used technology to draw attention to the agribusiness flaws in using mechanized labor, industrial work camps and pesticides in the fields.</p>\n<p>“They have also responded to the agribusiness efforts to dominate the visual field by turning a critical gaze on agribusiness in numerous graphics, photos, films and videos, thus decoupling technology from an exclusive connection to patriarchal white capitalism,” Marez said.</p>\n<p>Marez showed artwork by members of the Royal Chicano Air Force, a Chicano artist collective, and said the images show flight and the technologies of agribusiness, such as the crop duster.</p>\n<p>“All of the images in this project from the Royal Chicano Air Force are from special collections here at UC Santa Barbara,” Marez said. “So there is an incredibly rich collection of visual art related to the Chicano movement right here on this campus.”</p>\n<p>According to Marez, farm workers unions have tried to mobilize media technology to open spaces for supporters. Marez said Cesar Chavez’s famous slogans “Si Se Puede” and “It Can Be Done” demonstrate the uniting qualities of the farm worker movement.</p>\n<p>“Qualities that resonated with post-war decolonization and third-wordlist movements,” Marez said. “The worlds that farm workers built were shaped by both local and global concerns.”</p>\n<p>Sepideah Mohsenian-Rahman, Programmer of the MCC, said she enjoyed how Marez allowed the audience to choose a topic of discussion for his lecture.</p>\n<p>“I really appreciated how Dr. Marez was so interactive with the audience and allowed them to choose where to take the lecture. I have never seen anyone do that,” Mohsenian-Rahman said. “It could have been a totally different lecture if people chose different things — I thought that was interesting. I really find his work fascinating.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68336\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68336\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-17/curtis-marez-lectures-on-farm-worker-resistance-movements/","id":2533,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2532,2531,2530],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"DanceSafe Founder Educates Students on MDMA","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MDMA_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MDMA_Will-Tran-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"DanceSafe founder Emanuel Sferios gave a presentation on MDMA effects and safety on Wednesday in an event hosted by Students for Sensible Drug Policies UCSB Chapter (SSDP), Life of the Party (LOTP) an...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_68101\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68101\" data-attachment-id=\"68101\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-11/dancesafe-educates-students-on-mdma/mdma_will-tran-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MDMA_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"MDMA Lecture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MDMA_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MDMA_Will-Tran-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-68101\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MDMA_Will-Tran-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"DanceSafe founder Emanuel Sferios suggests a regulated system through which adults could obtain pure, legal MDMA, thus reducing the criminal market and access to minors.

Public Safety Commission.</p>\n<p>A full house was present at Embarcadero Hall as Sferios discussed the history of MDMA, its therapeutic use and public policies regarding the drug. He offered harm reduction strategies, sold drug testing kits and reminded attendees that no drug use is completely safe.</p>\n<p>Marjan Riazi, graduate from UCSB and education and outreach coordinator for the UCSB Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, said it is important students are informed on the effects of drug use and safest possible methods if they choose to experiment.</p>\n<p>“We are really excited that you are all here talking about something that is really important and certainly impacts our community,” Riazi said. “We are telling you learn the facts, learn the information … be safe, we just want you to known all the facts. Sometimes people hear things, especially in Isla Vista, that isn’t necessarily true especially when it comes to substances like MDMA.”</p>\n<p>Cole Garcia, SSDP chapter leader and a second-year biology major, said the goal of SSDP is to educate students on drug safety and public policies that can be ineffective.</p>\n<p>“Within the Isla Vista community we are working on similar things to the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, so harm reduction through education, but another goal of our group is to get future voters in our political system well educated on the ways that drug policy can be improved,” Garcia said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said universities typically focus on abstinence when discussing drug use, but they should instead take the same stance as they have on alcohol and educate students on how to partake as safely as possible if one chooses to do so.</p>\n<p>“The university doesn’t say just ‘don’t drink, just don’t do it!’ They say, ‘ok we know some people will and if you do you need to know what you are doing to be safe,’” Sferios said. “That same approach really needs to be happening with party drugs like MDMA and I am really glad to see that Life of the Party is here doing that.”</p>\n<p>According to Sferios, prohibition of MDMA creates a more dangerous situation in which safety education is often neglected.</p>\n<p>“I realized DanceSafe and other harm reduction programs are more trying to counter the harm that results from our drug policies,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said there are beneficial therapeutic uses of MDMA, particularly for treating PTSD, because it releases the brain’s stored serotonin.</p>\n<p>“The receptors of serotonin are excitatory and inhibitory in all the right places to reduce anxiety while at the same time making the person very alert and increasing activity in the forebrain where you put things in context and look at traumatic experiences without fear,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that the drug is always beneficial, as 15 to 20 people a year in the United States die after taking MDMA, according to Sferios.</p>\n<p>“I was told by Life of the Party that in the last five years there have been 10 deaths on this campus related to alcohol and prescription drugs but none related to Molly as far as I know on this campus,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said legal drugs may have a much higher fatality rate in the United States.<br>\n“Aspirin kills 400 people a year,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Users of MDMA should be weary of over-heating and take time to cool down and drink water to stay hydrated, because serotonin-based drugs increase the risk of heat stroke by limiting the body’s thermoregulation, according to Sferios.</p>\n<p>“There is a warning label on Prozac for the same reasons,” Sferios said. “Who has ever had a warning label when they bought their MDMA from a dealer that said be careful? No, that is because the drug is illegal and this kind of life-saving essential information is not allowed.”</p>\n<p>Sferios said public policy should aim to reduce “adulterated criminal market” that provides minors with MDMA and lacks safety regulation.</p>\n<p>“We don’t really want MDMA available in convenience stores, right? We want to protect young people, we want to protect our children,” Sferios said.</p>\n<p>Sferios said he recommends a regulated dispensary system through which adults could obtain pure, legal MDMA.</p>\n<p>“We would reduce the criminal market and reduce access to minors,” Sferios said. “You would still have some adults diverge and buying it and giving it to minors, but you would limit the amount of adults, you limit that process.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div

Tran / Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p>Approximately 50 students discussed the meaning and future implications of environmental racism and environmental justice at an event titled “What is Environmental Racism?” on Monday in the MultiCultural Center.</p>\n<p>The event was presented by the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E), the Human Rights Board and the Environmental Affairs Board (EAB). Attendees discussed environmental and social realities of incidents such as the Flint water crisis in Michigan, mining on Native American reservations, the I-710 corridor project and the Marcopper Mining Disaster in 1996.</p>\n<p>Nia Mitchell, EAB environmental justice chair and fourth-year environmental studies major, began the discussion by defining white supremacy and institutionalized racism.</p>\n<p>“White supremacy is an ideology in which white people or people of European descent are believed to be inherently better over people of color,” Mitchell said. “And it is institutionalized because different institutions uphold that power dynamic, so it is a disproportionate amount of power in certain communities and a lack thereof in others. When you link that system with the system of capitalism you get things like environmental racism.”</p>\n<p>Unique Vance, S.C.O.R.E. co-chair and third-year global studies major, gave an example of environmental racism.</p>\n<p>“One definition is the placement of low income or minority communities in proximity of environmentally hazardous or degraded environments,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Mitchell said environmental injustice is not just exploitation of the earth and its resources, but of people as well.</p>\n<p>“It is not only that these human beings have to deal with all of this pollution, but we have to think about the flora and the fauna that is being impacted by those polluting sites,” Mitchell said. “Without exploiting land and people at the same time, capitalism, and therefore profit, cannot exist.”</p>\n<p>Vance said government institutions, either intentionally or unintentionally, often ignore toxic waste and pollution, as in the case of Flint, Michigan where the water source from Lake Huron was switched to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure until a new supply line to Lake Huron was ready.</p>\n<p>Virginia Tech researchers found the water was highly corrosive, causing public outcry over the lack of response by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder.</p>\n<p>“The government was well aware of the consequences of lead,” Mitchell said. “Lead is a known neurotoxin to human beings.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell said it is nearly impossible for Flint residents to sell their homes, a struggle that was recently chronicled in <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/us/many-flint-residents-are-desperate-to-leave-but-see-no-escape.html\">The New York Times</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Monaé Orange, third-year black studies and sociology double major, attended the event and said Flint residents are still paying full price for the contaminated water.</p>\n<p>“They are still forced to pay their water bills and they are refusing to refund them for any of that,” Orange said.</p>\n<p>Vance said the people least responsible for climate change are most impacted by it.</p>\n<p>“The modern day environmental justice movement sprouted from some really amazing activists and people who were sick and tired of their communities being targeted by the state for environmental issues,” Vance said.</p>\n<p>Marjan Kris, S.C.O.R.E co-chair and second-year Asian American studies and history of public policy double major, said he and others are in the process of creating an environmental justice minor for UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We are planning on creating an environmental justice minor at UCSB,” Kris said. “Future first and second-years, probably third-years too, keep an eye out.”</p><div

and UCSB alumnus, and Natan Sharansky, author, activist and chair of The Jewish Agency, discussed their relationships with Judaism, anti-Semitism, activism and religious pluralism Wednesday in Pollock Theater.</p>\n<p>The event was part of a three-part university tour titled “Jewish Journeys,” which began Thursday at Brown University and stopped at Stanford University before arriving at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Both Sharansky and Douglas became active in the Jewish community after their childhoods.</p>\n<p>“I grew up knowing zero about my Jewish-ness,” Sharansky said of growing up in Soviet-ruled Donetsk, Ukraine. He said he knew his family was Jewish only because it was “written on the I.D. of your parents” and because of “all the conversations about anti-Semitism and discrimination.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said being a Jew at the time was like being “born with some very rare disease,” and the only “medicine” was being the best at your trade.</p>\n<p>“Your parents are telling to you, because you are Jewish, everywhere — in school, in university, in kindergarten — you must be number one,” Sharansky said. “In physics or mathematics or in chess or in music or in dance, whatever, it doesn’t matter, you must be the best at your profession. That is the way how we Jews survive.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said many Jewish people felt a sense of community after the Six-Day War of 1967 — when Israel gained the upper hand against the Soviet Union and its Egyptian and Syrian allies —leading to increased activism among Jews.</p>\n<p>After the war in 1967, Sharansky said, “Israel entered our lives very powerfully because the victory of Israel over allies of the Soviet Union was a huge humiliation for the Soviet Union.”</p>\n<p>Sharansky said, following the Six-Day War, he realized the importance of his connection to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“Suddenly, you find out, you discover that all the people around you, your friends and your enemies, they all connect you to the Israeli army,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said after his son’s bar mitzvah, his family visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem, after which the Genesis Prize Foundation recognized his commitment to the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“A few pictures were taken; it made the Israeli press,” Douglas said. “The next thing I know, the Genesis group contacts me and presents this incredible prize, this opportunity which I was truly touched because I felt I was part of a tribe.”</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Israeli government opened a permanent egalitarian prayer space earlier this week at the Western Wall.</p>\n<p>“That is the place where Jews are coming for 3,000 years to talk to God and at the same time; it is the number-one national symbol,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Sharansky said years of negotiations have resulted in the understanding that even though some compromises regarding the Wall may be painful, the unity of Jewish people is more important.</p>\n<p>“For me, it is very important that we as a Jewish community always will be open and welcoming for those who are invested,” Sharansky said.</p>\n<p>Douglas said the Jewish people have reason to be optimistic about their history and the future.</p>\n<p>“It is a sense of community, and I have been deeply inspired by my son and by my father,” Douglas said. “So I see and feel a continuity of generations, a sense of immortality. I am hopeful and optimistic.”</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A segment of the event, April Savage, third-year biology major, asked about interfaith climates on college campuses. Douglas responded by encouraging discussion of controversial subjects.</p>\n<p>“People always say, ‘don’t talk about politics or religion and you will always get along.’ I would encourage a dialogue and being able to open up and expose yourself and have the support of Hillel behind you,” Douglas said, referring to the Jewish nonprofit student group.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman, executive director of Santa Barbara Hillel, said UCSB has more Jewish undergraduate students than any other UC campus and that 160 students traveled to Israel on birthright trips last year.</p>\n<p>Andrew Packer, third-year economics and accounting major, described his experience with Santa Barbara Hillel and his birthright experience.</p>\n<p>“For me, Santa Barbara Hillel has enabled me to reconnect with my Jewish roots,” Packer said. “It allows me to continue my cultural exploration of Judaism and opens the dialogue on religion.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Though this policy has been implemented and revised, a meeting was held on Wednesday to consider how recent changes will affect the student body and student access to support programs. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Students, staff and administrators met in the UCen’s Santa Barbara Harbor Room on Wednesday to discuss recent changes to how UCSB will respond to reports of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>The group focused on evaluating the recently implemented UC-wide Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy and how it will affect UCSB students.</p>\n<p>Senior Associate Dean of Student Life Debbie Fleming began the discussion by explaining the purpose of the meeting.</p>\n<p>“Our goal from the staff side of things is just to make sure that we have an opportunity for regular communication, that we have an opportunity to sit down and hear from you about your ideas and thoughts on things, if there are concerns you think we need to beware of,” Fleming said.</p>\n<p>Fleming said under UC policy, each campus has some freedom to determine implementation procedures.</p>\n<p>“That is actually something we have more control over are our own campus procedures, so we can go back, look at that and amend that,” Fleming said. “The policy is the policy for now. It has been embedded, system-wide it has been approved, it has been implemented as of Jan. 4, so we don’t have the ability to make any changes to the policy, but we do have the ability to make changes to the way we describe the implementation procedures, and we can clarify things that aren’t clear.”</p>\n<p>Briana Conway, victim advocacy specialist for C.A.R.E. Advocate Office for Sexual and Gender Based Violence and Sexual Misconduct program at UCSB, said the policy is clear for reports of a student perpetrator, but other procedures need further specification.</p>\n<p>“I think phase two of that and ongoing will be really fleshing out what are the procedures when any one party is a non-affiliate and how do we work through next steps and action items as far as recording for that,” Conway said.</p>\n<p>Timothy Irvine, vice president for Committees and Planning of the Graduate Students Association, said a flow chart for procedures on student reports could be useful.</p>\n<p>“If that could be adopted here and accessible, but accessible without students having to go into C.A.R.E., so on a website or something, so if something has happened they don’t necessarily have to go in and consult with someone to get clarity on what the process might look like. I think that would be great,” Irvine said.</p>\n<p>Irvine said websites explaining the procedures can potentially be difficult to navigate.</p>\n<p>“Certainly if you know how to navigate these things, you can find what to do depending on what your situation is, and if you go to C.A.R.E., it is really easy to report and call C.A.R.E. and go into C.A.R.E., but that is not necessarily what everyone wants to do.”</p>\n<p>Suzanne Perkin, assistant dean for student life at the Office of Judicial Affairs, said the C.A.R.E. Advocate Office is preparing a one-page document to distribute to students.</p>\n<p>“We are working on a summary and overview one-page document on this process, so that is something that could just be handed out,” Perkin said. “Then we were thinking about, on the back, putting the flow chart.”</p>\n<p>Conway said there should be a balance of transparency and privacy in the reporting and advocacy processes.</p>\n<p>“What is that happy medium? We can put it all out there for transparency, and, yes, I fully support that. But I don‘t want it to ever lose the beautiful bond that an advocate can provide and help a survivor navigate their options,” Conway said. “That is the core value of why I wake up every morning.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, February 4, 2016 edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-04/ucsb-examines-revised-sexual-violence-policy/","id":2618,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[2617,2616,2615],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CALPIRG Hosts Panel To Discuss Citizens United","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Calpirg.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Calpirg.jpg?resize=406%2C270&ssl=1","description":"California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) hosted a panel Thursday evening to discuss the consequences of the Supreme Court’s decision on Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission in ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) hosted a panel Thursday evening to discuss the consequences of the Supreme Court’s decision on Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission in 2010.</p>\n<p>In the Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission case, the Court ruled that political spending is protected under the First Amendment and corporations and unions can spend unlimited amounts of money on politics, as long as it is done independently of a party or candidate. The panel discussed the consequences and possible future solutions of the money given to these Political Action Committees (PACs) that are allegedly independent from the candidates they support.</p>\n<p>City council member Gregg Hart said people cannot expect elected officials at every level of government to be looking out for citizens’ best interests, and said citizens should be as knowledgeable as possible about information on social media and television.</p>\n<p>“Education and engagement of citizens at a much more fundamental level about government is really the answer,” Hart said. “It is impossible today to be a passive citizen to have an effect.”</p>\n<p>Hart said oftentimes factions arise that campaign only to their voters, resulting in many opinions getting lost through censorship.</p>\n<p>“As we are overloaded with information, we are censoring ourselves; we are selecting the information we are trying to sort through and to find value in,” Hart said. “In doing that, we are not hearing other people’s perspectives.”</p>\n<p>According to Hart, the amount of money given to political campaigns should not be a deciding factor for voters who have taken the time to learn about the issues and candidates.</p>\n<p>“An uninformed voter [shouldn’t be] persuaded by a goofy television ad that was funded by a corporation,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Jared Daniels, fourth-year political science and history double major and Associated Students external vice president of statewide affairs voter registration director, said the problem is not only within the Executive and Legislative branches, but is in the Judicial branch as well.</p>\n<p>“Citizens United has created an entire generation of Justices which highly benefit from Citizens United, and that all carry on with them throughout their Judicial career,” Daniels said. “So to me, the influence of money and what should be the most nonpartisan, un-ideological branch of government is also subject to the exorbitant amount of funds that are in politics today.”</p>\n<p>Political science professor Eric Smith said the main issue in campaigns is inequality between economic statuses.</p>\n<p>“There has been a huge transfer, bigger than any in this nation’s history, of money from working class, middle class people, to the corporations and the extremely rich are soaking up huge amounts of it and it comes out in public policy,” Smith said. “The cost of going to school or the cost of health insurance that we pay, a whole bunch of policies turn on inequality, and we are all suffering.”</p>\n<p>Smith said one solution could be to give the power to regulate campaign finances back to Congress and state legislatures.</p>\n<p>“If you want to do something about inequality, this would be a huge first step,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Hart said there is a distorted democracy and figuring out ways to work around the existing system of campaigns is unimaginably hard.</p>\n<p>“Changing Citizens United is only a step in that process … there are many other loopholes,” Hart said. “There is so much money at stake in this sort of equation.”</p>\n<p>Hart said the influence of money between Democratic and Republican funded campaigns is “dramatically different.”</p>\n<p>“The judges of the Supreme Court who passed Citizens United [and] who are constantly ruling in ways that protect corporate influence and disadvantage regular people are the Republicans,” Hart said.</p>\n<p>Daniels said where the funding is coming from plays a large part in where it is delegated.</p>\n<p>“We have to look that this also includes union money,” Daniels said. “Union money is a factor [which] would by and large benefit the Democratic Party. So of course there is always going to be that question: ‘Does money really affect the voting behavior of elected representatives?’”</p>\n<p>Ezinne Meremikwu, Against Citizens United campaign coordinator at CALPIRG, said CALPRIG is gathering local support to end the corporate funding of elections.</p>\n<p>“We are actually working with the Santa Barbara City Council to basically get Santa Barbara to put themselves on record on being against Citizens United,” Meremikwu said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

UCSB’s Startup Weekend Friday through Sunday at Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>The event allowed attendees to connect with sponsors and company representatives from Dandelion Nitro, SB Hackers, StartupSB, I.V. Cuts, Impact Radius and Citrix. Participating entrepreneurs pitched their ideas on Friday and looked for members to add to their teams. Attendees voted for the top 15 teams, and these teams competed Saturday and Sunday to build the best product.</p>\n<p>The top teams also competed with teams from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, which was hosting its own Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>Clint Nelsen, co-founder of Startup Weekend and CEO of Ticketbase, brought the event, which takes place in 135 countries, to Santa Barbara in 2009.</p>\n<p>“Over an impromptu lunch, we shook hands to buy the company from [previous owner Andrew Hyde] for about $150,000, and we didn’t have a penny in our bank accounts,” Nelsen said.</p>\n<p>Mark Cardona, who graduated from UCSB in 2009, said his interest in entrepreneurship began with selling candy out of his backpack in middle school.</p>\n<p>“I actually made quite a bit of money doing that, and ever since then I have been trying to build other businesses,” Cardona said.</p>\n<p>ProductPlan founder Jim Semick shared advice on building a business and finding lean market validation.</p>\n<p>“A lot of products come to market, and the founders and people who are starting the company are really excited about it,” Semick said. “They believe their ideas can change the world, and unfortunately the world doesn’t care sometimes. This [weekend] is really the lowest-risk chance for you to get in front of people and talk about your idea.</p>\n<p>Navjot Brar, president of UCSB’s Entrepreneurs Association and fourth-year mechanical engineering major, said there were more student attendees than in past years.</p>\n<p>“This year it is a whole new UCSB crowd and new people being introduced to this Startup Weekend,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>Startup Weekend, which has taken place downtown in past years, was moved to UCSB in part due to financial reasons, according to Brar.</p>\n<p>Brar said Associated Students gave the group $8,000, which was used to buy supplies for the weekend.</p>\n<p>“We have 3D printers set up, we give everyone a free website domain, we give mentorship, presentation feedback — literally everything that you need in a weekend,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>Brar said meeting people who have their own companies is students’ favorite part of Startup Weekend.</p>\n<p>“There was a survey of Startup Weekend, and the number one thing people love the most is the networking. It is just fun, it is natural — it brings you out of your comfort zone,” Brar said.</p>\n<p>15 teams presented a product on Sunday night to six judges.</p>\n<p>Closed Cycle, a bike security device, and Triameter, a room 3D scanner, tied for first.</p>\n<p>Owen Roth, a team member for Closed Cycle, said tying for first “feels awesome,” and the weekend was a rewarding experience that allowed him to engage with new people.</p>\n<p>“The whole experience was an adrenaline rush that put you through a lot of sleepless nights, and then it was a lot of interacting with really intelligent people that had a lot of knowledge,” Roth said. “It was an intense learning experience and so educational. For me it was like going back to college again.”</p>\n<p>Bernie Corea, a team member from Triameter and a third-year economics major, said he did not know anyone on his winning team before beginning the competition.</p>\n<p>“I came here not knowing what to expect,” Corea said. “We started off with initially drone attachments and pivoted very quickly to creating something for real estate agencies to be able to map. We really quickly realized we had a project with huge scalable opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The two first place teams each received a $1,500 patent-filing application, a three month co-working space at the Goleta Entrepreneurial Magnet, 10 hours of access to the “Presidio Board Room” at Workzones for the team, a year-long membership to Startup SB, a startup consult and incorporation package from Cardona Law, a chance to present in front of investors at a Tech Coast Angels Meeting, a one-year membership to the UCSB Entrepreneurs Association and one free haircut from I.V. Cuts for each team member.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-67181\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Self Governance Initiative held a public meeting Tuesday to discuss the management of community facilities in I.V.’s potential Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s meeting, which took place at the I.V. Clinic Building, was the second to last in a series of meetings the Initiative organized for community members to discuss the framework and specific services that may be offered in the proposed CSD if its formation is approved in the November 2016 county elections. At the meeting, participants explored what services the I.V. Community Center should offer and how the CSD should run other facilities. It was determined community facilities should only be used by public entities or nonprofits for public purposes. The final meeting in the series is scheduled for the same time and place next week and will focus on parking issues.</p>\n<p>Darcel Elliott, community organizer for the office of Assemblymember Das Williams, said she wants the CSD governing board to have some power over the management of community facilities.</p>\n<p>“The power that we are talking about tonight is the ability to acquire, construct, improve, maintain and operate community facilities, including but not limited to community centers, libraries, theaters, cultural facilities and child care facilities,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>According to Elliot, some feel this level of influence is excessive.</p>\n<p>“This was actually one of the powers that kind of freaked people out because of how broad it was,” Elliot said.</p>\n<p>The Board of Supervisors appropriated just under half a million dollars for the renovation of the I.V. Clinic Building, and a grant writer could bring in funding for basic maintenance of the Clinic and other buildings, according to Elliot.</p>\n<p>“The grant writer would be just trying to help supplement the basic maintenance of these buildings, because I am not sure with the limited budget that we have for the CSD that we will be able to execute too many of these programs,” Elliott said.</p>\n<p>Elliot said a grant writer, which would cost $50,000 per year, could also work to obtain funding for Community Center services.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_67180\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-67180\" data-attachment-id=\"67180\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-06/stakeholders-discuss-usage-of-community-facilities/stakeholders_by-paris-cullen-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 1100D\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1452066581\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"55\",\"iso\":\"5000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Stakeholders_by Paris Cullen-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-67180\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1-1024x682.jpg?resize=400%2C267\" alt=\"Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stakeholders_by-Paris-Cullen-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-67180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Paris Cullen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“A grant writer would be focused on getting grants to provide services like career advice and mental health services,” Elliot said.</p>\n<p>Associated Students Letters and Science collegiate senator and third-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar said he imagines the Community Center being similar to the A.S.

want to throw a Zumba class or the art exhibition — things like that.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara City College trustee Jonathan Abboud said the Community Center could have flexible usage for students and non-students, such as providing a family space, emergency food storage, English as second language (ESL) classes, luncheons and workshops.</p>\n<p>“For other non-UCSB students in I.V., something like career services — a career training program, like, mental health — that would be very beneficial for the people that live here,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>UCSB economics lecturer Lanny Ebenstein said the

Clinic Building.</p>\n<p>I.V. resident Bruce Murdock said he estimates around 30 to 40 percent of people who park in Isla Vista are students and faculty using the town as alternative campus parking.</p>\n<p>“The number of people that go to UCSB, both faculty and students, don’t want to pay the fees to park on campus so they come and park in Isla Vista,” Murdock said. “They are people that are from the outside and parked there so they can go to the campus.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have freedom, I have freedom to have a car. How can the University tell me that … I can’t have a car because I am a freshman?<br>\n<em>– I.V. resident Bruce Murdock</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>I.V. resident Peter Neushul said the amount of parking in I.V. does not coincide with its resident population.</p>\n<p>“The new towers and new villages going up are going to have staff and those staff are going to want to park for free in our town,” Neushul said. “So it has to be looked upon as it is something that is just going to get worse and something that now encircles the entire Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said the demand for street parking will decrease if property owners lower in-unit parking fees.</p>\n<p>“If we could make it so that the landlords that are providing parking weren’t charging extra for parking … that would lessen some of the load on the on-street parking,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Murdock said landlords cannot alleviate the issue by lowering fees because there are not enough parking spaces on the properties.</p>\n<p>“If you’ve got an apartment that has 30 students and you have 10 parking places you can pass all the laws you want and write all the reports you want, you’ve still only got 10 parking spaces,” Murdock said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66502\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66502\" data-attachment-id=\"66502\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/parking_by-vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1325&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1325\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447611919\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"58\",\"iso\":\"500\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Parking Commission Meeting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66502\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1-250x166.jpg?resize=350%2C232\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Parking_by-Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-66502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Murdock also said many I.V. residents who have access to parking garages fail to use them.</p>\n<p>“Its purpose is to park a car, now how many of the garages that are affiliated with apartments and or houses do they park cars in? Not many,” Murdock said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said future permit plans should reference previous I.V. parking regulation attempts, such as the Isla Vista Master Plan parking management program of 2004 which was denied by the Coastal Commission.</p>\n<p>“Coastal Commission’s main priority is to protect access of the public to the coast … that access points can be parked in at reasonable fees so that the beaches of California remain accessible to everybody,” Freeman said. “They end up in a strange position when communities like us come to them with parking programs.”</p>\n<p>Freeman said UCSB should discourage first-year students from bringing their cars to Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“If the University provided that as a really strong statement in their introductory material to send to their parents, then the parents would have a strong influence on their children, saying ‘well the University really doesn’t want you to have a car there,’” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Murdock said freshman students have a “right” to car ownership.</p>\n<p>“I have freedom, I have freedom to have a car,” Murdock said. “How can the University tell me that … I can’t have a car because I am a freshman?”</p>\n<p>Freeman said UCSB will not voluntarily alleviate the I.V. parking problem without incentive.</p>\n<p>“We need to be thinking about how to exert leverage outside the University in order to get them to do things we might want them to do,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Hammond said a mobile home site for students living in trailers could be an alternative parking solution.</p>\n<p>“A better solution might be to try and build some sort of trailer park somewhere for people who live in trailers or in their cars to park safely,” Hammond said.</p>\n<p>Freeman said instead of I.V. parking officers determining whether cars are parked for more than 72 hours by chalking tires, officers could implement a pay-by-plate program.</p>\n<p>“You have an SUV drive through I.V. and as it drives through I.V., it is scanning all the license plates that are along the side of the road and determining what cars are in what positions,” Freeman said. “And then if you want to buy a permit you don’t have to decide on a parking spot, you aren’t tied to a spot, you can just pay by tying your license plate into either a kiosk or a website or over the phone. That means that we can have visitor parking to be essentially any spot we want in I.V.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66538\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66538\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/local-residents-and-students-meet-to-discuss-a-parking-permit-program-in-i-v/","id":4606,"author":{"id":118,"name":"Peeka Zimmerman"},"related":[4605,4604,4603],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/118"}},"__N_SSG":true}
