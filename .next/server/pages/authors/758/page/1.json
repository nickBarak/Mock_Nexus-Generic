Nominated for over 25 awards for his leading role as Stephen Hawking in the biographical film “The Theory of Everything,” the 33-year-old British actor has already won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors’ Guild Awards for Best Actor in a drama. He’s a strong contender for a BAFTA and an Academy Award.</p>\n<p>Felicity Jones, 31, who played Stephen Hawking’s wife, Jane Wilde Hawking, was also nominated for many awards, including all listed above. But last Thursday, Jan. 29 at the Arlington Theatre, both leads were recognized with the Cinema Vanguard Award. The SBIFF tribute celebrated their outstanding careers, particularly their acclaimed performances in “The Theory of Everything.”</p>\n<p>The night began with a red carpet event featuring Redmayne and Jones accompanied by Anthony McCarten, screenwriter of the film. The stars met and greeted fans before walking along the line of reporters, starting with the television journalists and moving down. I waited patiently toward the end of the line, and although Redmayne ran out of time, I did get the opportunity to ask Jones one question: How did she feel about playing such an important role in giving Jane the credit she deserves for the impact she had on Stephen’s life an achievements?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“That’s the whole reason I’m here, because of that woman,” Jones said. “[Jane], in many ways, was a bit of an invisible woman, and it’s been an absolute honor, and very important, to bring her story to light. That has always been the main focus for all of us, in making the film, to shed light on this phenomenal woman.”</p>\n<p>After the meetings with reporters, and when the photographers finished taking all the red carpet snaps they needed, the procession moved inside the theater for the main event. Roger Durling, executive director of the film festival, gave a short speech and introduced Scott Feinberg, writer for <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, who moderated the evening. The Q&amp;A was interspersed with three clips from “The Theory of Everything” as well as clips from past films starring the actors including “Savage Grace,” “My Week with Marilyn” and “Les Misérables” for Redmayne, and “The Tempest,” “Like Crazy” and “The Invisible Woman” for Jones.</p>\n<p>Feinberg asked them many questions, starting with if they knew each other before the film. The two had met before, having auditioned for a few of the same films, none of which either of them earned, they joked.</p>\n<p>Meeting Stephen and Jane Wilde Hawking was an honor for the pair, and they described how nervous they would get whenever one of the Hawkings visited the set during production. They also talked about the difficulties of portraying the different stages of Stephen’s ALS, which included Jones acting out the changing methods Jane would use as his disease progressed. This was especially difficult considering that scenes, for budget reasons, are not filmed in chronological order. Luckily, both Stephen and Jane loved the actors’ performances, saying it was like watching themselves.</p>\n<p>Drawing away from “Theory,” the two elaborated on their earlier work. Redmayne described his incredibly awkward but amusing experiences playing Julianne Moore’s son in “Savage Grace<em>,</em>” which is about an incestuous mother-son relationship. While filming “My Week with Marilyn<em>,</em>” he remembered how insensitive he sometimes was about how difficult it was for Michelle Williams to play an icon like Marilyn Monroe. The insensitivity came back to haunt him during his trial and tribulations while acting as Stephen.</p>\n<p>Jones also discussed the interesting experience she had filming “Like Crazy.” The film did not have a formal script, just a very detailed story outline around which the actors improvised all of their dialogue. She said this was a difficult but rewarding experience, and did improvisation again with the same director in “Breathe In.”</p>\n<p>The Q&amp;A ended with Feinberg introducing screenwriter McCarten to the stage to present the Cinema Vanguard Award. His moving and funny speech praised the stars for their talent, wit and most of all, their young age. “Their combined age is 35,” he joked. He also thanked them for their extraordinary performances that brought his screenplay to life and gave them their award, ending the beautiful night in downtown Santa Barbara.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-05/%c2%ac%c2%ac%c2%aceddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-honored-with-the-cinema-vanguard-award-theory-of-everything-stars-speak-to-the-nexus-on-the-red-carpet/","id":6064,"author":{"id":758,"name":"Arasch Blurfrushan"},"related":[6063,6062,6061],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Portrayal of the Personal Lives of Stephen and Jane Hawking","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In 2004, novelist and screenwriter Anthony McCarten read Travelling to Infinity, the autobiography of Jane Hawking, first wife of the iconic physicist Stephen Hawking.

Her story inspired him enough to catch a train and knock on her door, initiating an eight-year mission to earn her trust and acquire the rights to her book to adapt it into a motion picture. For those eight years, he crafted a screenplay that became the film “The Theory of Everything”.</p>\n<p>“The Theory of Everything” traces the lives of the Hawkings from their first meeting at Cambridge University through the 1980s. Shortly after they met in 1963 and after only a few dates, Stephen was diagnosed with ALS and given two years to live. Despite the tragic news, Jane decided to continue seeing him and dedicated herself to helping him fight the disease. They were engaged in 1964, and she stuck by him as the disease progressed, eventually causing him to lose his abilities to walk, talk and take care of himself.</p>\n<p>Stephen Hawking is famous for overcoming the limitations of his disease and making advances in the field of theoretical physics and cosmology. However, “The Theory of Everything” focuses on the behind-the-scenes aspects of Hawking’s life and the impact Jane had on it. She really was the unspoken hero, who gave up her studies in order to help him live, something he was not capable of doing on his own. Her efforts allowed him to focus on physics and make the accomplishments that made him the legend he is today.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones portray Stephen and Jane, and they do not disappoint. Their performances are exceptional. Redmayne’s portrayal is particularly impressive because of his lack of dialogue in the film. He depicted the slow deterioration of Stephen’s speech, which culminated in complete loss after a life-threatening surgery. Redmayne used facial expressions to convey much of Stephen’s emotions while illustrating the different stages of the disease, a difficult feat when one keeps in mind that scenes are not filmed in chronological order. Jones, on the other hand, excellently portrayed Jane’s struggle to balance taking care of her husband, raising their children and dealing with their financial problems.</p>\n<p>Although it wouldn’t really be a spoiler since the film is not fictional, I won’t reveal how the film and the Hawkings’ marriage pans out. But I will say that the final act gave me a new perspective on Stephen Hawking. I can say for certain that he would not have been able to do what he’s achieved or make the impacts he’s made if it was not for Jane Hawking. She gave up her dreams for love, dedicating her life to a man she had just met. She saw something in him that was powerful enough for her to make such a life-changing decision, and she was strong enough to devote herself to him. What she did is a great achievement in itself, and one that not very many people would be capable of. It had a larger impact on the world than she probably ever imagined.</p>\n<p>When I first walked into the screening at Pollock Theater, I felt the fear that I always get when seeing a biographical film, the fear that it wouldn’t effectively convey the intricacies of the subject’s life. These films boil down the long and complex journey of a person’s entire existence to two hours. Think of all the inherent problems and difficulties that could come with that. However, “The Theory of Everything” does not claim to delineate Hawking’s entire life, focusing instead on one particular aspect of it. And it portrayed that surprisingly well.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t the only one that didn’t house many complaints. In the Q&amp;A that followed the screening, Anthony McCarten told the story of when they screened the movie for Stephen Hawking himself. He was brought to tears, and after providing the gift of his unique computer voice to the producers, the only complaint he had was why it ended only halfway through his life.</p>\n<p><em>“The Theory of Everything” opens at the Camino Real Marketplace Theater on Nov. 21.

I used to wonder whether the owner of that fist ever pulled the pin, but looking back at the impact and influence <em>American Idiot</em> has had on popular music in the past decade, I’d say he did. <em>American Idiot</em> by Green Day hit shelves on September 20, 2004, and is classified as a rock opera, or an album with a story, a concept originated by The Who.</p>\n<p>The album tells the story of a young punk who calls himself Jesus of Suburbia. Bored with small town life, he moves to the big city where he creates an alter ego: St. Jimmy, the cool, confident punk that Jesus has always wanted to be. He also meets a girl who he calls Whatsername and falls in love with her rebelliousness. The album was controversial at the time of its release, mainly for its charged political undertones and its criticism of the Bush administration and the mass media. In honor of the tenth anniversary of this classic album, here are six facts about <em>American Idiot</em> you may not have known.</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>1. The famous album cover was inspired by a lyric in the album.</p>\n<p>The lesser-known track “She’s a Rebel” contains the line “she’s holding on my heart like a hand grenade.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>2. American Idiot</em> exists because of a studio theft.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, Green Day was working on a record called <em>Cigarettes &amp; Valentines</em>, but when it was almost complete, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the album, the band decided that the theft was a sign that the album was not their best possible work. They started from scratch and <em>American Idiot</em> was born. Surprisingly, the songs were never leaked by the thief.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3. Brandon Flowers of The Killers criticized Green Day for being anti-American.</p>\n<p>The Killers’ rise to fame coincided with the launch of <em>American Idiot</em>. But their singer, Brandon Flowers didn’t appreciate Green Day playing their songs overseas. He said the concert film <em>Bullet in a Bible</em>, filmed in the UK, offended him because Green Day was making America look bad in the eyes of kids in other nations. “Where do they film their DVD? In England. A bunch of kids screaming ‘I don’t want to be an American idiot,’” Flowers said. However, in 2013, Flowers apologized to the band for his comments during a The Killers concert at Wembley Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. The album was adapted into a Broadway play in 2009.</p>\n<p><em>American Idiot</em> became a musical that used every song from the record as well as some songs from follow-up album <em>21st Century Breakdown</em>. The musical premiered in Berkeley in 2009 before debuting on Broadway in 2010.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5. The release of <em>American Idiot</em> marked the second time Green Day had been criticized for selling out.</p>\n<p>When Green Day first rose to fame with their third studio album, <em>Dookie, </em>in 1994, their friends and fans in the Berkeley underground punk scene ostracized them for signing to a major label. Ironically, many of the people that embraced them and the newly popular punk culture similarly lambasted the baned ten years later for their reinvented sound on <em>American Idiot</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6. “Wake Me Up When September Ends” is not about 9/11, but the death of singer Billie Joe Armstrong’s father.</p>\n<p>In September of 1982, when Armstrong was 10 years old, his father passed away. After the funeral he ran to his room crying and locked himself inside.
