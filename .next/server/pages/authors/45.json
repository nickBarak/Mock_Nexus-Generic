The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.”</p>\n<p>Those were some of the opening lines of Malcolm X’s speech at the funeral of Ronald Stokes in 1962.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 56 years to 2018, Kimberlé Crenshaw would argue X’s statements still ring true.</p>\n<p>Last Wednesday, April 25, attendees at Campbell Hall heard the words of Crenshaw, who popularized the concept of “intersectionality” nearly three decades ago. The event was organized by UC Santa Barbara’s MultiCultural Center and Student Affairs.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.law.columbia.edu/pt-br/news/2017/06/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality\">Q&amp;A interview with Columbia Law School last year</a>, Crenshaw defined intersectionality as follows:</p>\n<p>“Intersectionality is a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It’s not simply that there’s a race problem here, a gender problem here and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.”</p>\n<p>A well-established scholar of critical race theory and law, Crenshaw spoke in front of a packed Campbell Hall audience.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply give a lecture to the audience, Crenshaw used a simulated dialogue between the late Martin Luther King Jr. and her colleague, renowned civil right activist and law expert, Barbara Arnwine.</p>\n<p>The imagined conversation gave life to Crenshaw’s intersectionality theory beyond what people have read or written on a page. Crenshaw told the audience the conversation was a reminder that although King strived for social justice, black women were not accounted for enough.</p>\n<p>Through Arnwine, she spoke about the way that prominent individuals like King and U.S. President Barack Obama upheld patriarchal beliefs.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major and black studies minor Nisa Smith said Crenshaw’s identity being similar to her own “made everything extra important” because she didn’t just talk about racism in a “one-dimensional” way.</p>\n<p>“People tend to only care about liberation as it pertains to them only. I feel like people are not always truly willing to do the work to eradicate their own privilege. Even if you are marginalized in your own way, you are also privileged in some way,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw discussed modern movements that have shed light on the role of black women in the U.S. #SayHerName is a movement created to bring awareness for black women who have lost their lives to police brutality and still have not been given justice.</p>\n<p>The words have been used in references to the killing of Sandra Bland, but before Bland’s name was even mentioned at Campbell Hall on Wednesday, a segment of Crenshaw’s dialogue asked audience members to hold their hands above their head if they recognized the names of victims of police brutality.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw first announced the names of black men such as Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Philando Castile and countless others associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, in which a majority of the audience’s hands remained up.</p>\n<p>However, once she listed the names of black women who are victims – Natasha McKenna, Michelle Cusseaux, India Beaty, Maya Hall and more – many started putting their hands down after the mentioning of just one name.</p>\n<p>As all hands in the lecture hall were no longer lifted, Crenshaw left a moment of silence intended to serve as a wakeup call showing the need for intersectionality and why it was created.</p>\n<p>Crenshaw’s perspective was not lost on the audience, including Smith, who said women should be given more recognition than they are currently given.</p>\n<p>“Black women are experiencing violence on the account of both their race and gender at minimum. These things shouldn’t have to be constantly said. People have to be bullied into giving recognition, attention and respect to black women,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Ingrid Banks, professor of black studies at UCSB, said she often uses Crenshaw’s work in her classes and lauded her influence in activism and academia.</p>\n<p>“One of Professor Crenshaw’s most important scholarly contributions is that she brilliantly argues that the limitations of anti-discriminatory theory beg for an intersectional approach in both Black Studies and Feminist Studies,” Banks said in an email.</p>\n<p>Banks said Crenshaw’s work is not “arrested” within academia and that her work often transcends into activism.</p>\n<p>“Her scholarly work finds legs in the activist efforts she makes on behalf of black girls and women. Both her scholarship and activism bleed intersectionality,” Banks said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story was printed on pg. 1 of the May 3, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82873\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82873\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/intersectionality-founder-kimberle-crenshaw-graces-campbell-hall/","id":2849,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[2848,2847,2846],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus & Answer: Gabe’s Farewell Isn’t Goodbye, UCSB’s Star Aims for Pros","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Co-Sports Editor Sean White caught up with former UCSB basketball star Gabe Vincent and asked him about his future plans, his experience in the Dos Equis 3x3 championship and more in this installment ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_82205\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"788111766\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82388\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82205\" data-attachment-id=\"82205\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/nexus-answer-gabes-farewell-isnt-goodbye-ucsbs-star-aims-for-pros/gabe-vincent-plays-defense-dustin-harris-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MBball_vsCalPoly-180303-DustinHarris-05-web.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Gabe Vincent plays defense.

Although overlooked, the journey of a four-year starter is still alive. It’s usually the case at mid-major Division I schools. It’s a reality we oftentimes witness at UCSB on a yearly basis. While it is common at UCSB, the opportunity to watch a player’s development over the span of four years is a priceless experience. In the case of guard Gabe Vincent, who is preparing for the next chapter in his playing career, the four-year process was nothing short of fulfilling as his name is forever etched in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Your collegiate career has officially come to an end. Have you had the chance to reflect on your time as a Gaucho?</strong><br>\nGV: “I did a little bit [of reflecting] after the loss in the Big West Tournament. I took a week off, but that was more so for my body, so it could recuperate and get prepared for my next step. It’s been a fun ride. I completed some things I didn’t think I would or really had in my sights. Obviously, I had some unfinished business. But all in all, it’s been amazing. Everything I could have ever wanted it to be in many ways.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Speaking of “unfinished business,” the main focus was to make the NCAA tournament. It was a feat that didn’t happen for you during your career. After going through that, how much of an impact did it have on you? At the same time, how did it influence your mentality to grind for it year in and year out?</strong><br>\nGV: “It’s a motivation. It’s a goal for every collegiate basketball player. At least it should be if it isn’t. That’s the ultimate goal every season, day in and day out. Falling short of that year after year makes you work harder in the offseason. It’s the ultimate motivation; not achieving something you wanted and planned to achieve. That journey was rough. Battling back from injury, looking back, it has all helped mold me into who I am today. Not achieving this goal is still going to motivate me everyday moving forward in my professional career as well.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>SW: Just a few weeks ago, you, Leland King II and two other seniors of the Big West (CP’s Victor Joseph and UCR’s Chance Murray) played in college basketball’s first ever three-on-three tournament/national championship (Dos Equis 3×3). Y’all didn’t win the championship, but can you talk about that experience? Was it difficult adjusting to playing with two guys you usually were matched up against? How was it to be able to do something that college athletes aren’t allowed to do as far as making some money?</strong><br>\nGV: “That experience was very different. Very different. Even though we were representing the Big West and Santa Barbara in a way, it didn’t feel like it because we were getting paid. It more so felt like ‘this is the first step toward a professional career.’ It was fun being able to play for money with those other guys that you are used to being enemies with. You study their game and film, and know everything they can do left and right. It was definitely nice to play with them and not against them, and get to know them in a different way. Even the game of three-on-three with the rules they had was something that five-on-five doesn’t even expose you to at all. Being able to battle and get to the championship was a great opportunity that went really well for us. Unfortunately, we fell short but we were able to make some money and played well.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Although your collegiate playing career has concluded, you are already back training and preparing for the next level. How has that process been? What kind of regimen are you on at the moment? Is there anything new or are you sticking to your usual preparation leading up to that moment?</strong><br>\nGV: “The preparation is a little bit different in terms of not having games to prepare for right now. It’s more so preparing for workouts and being ready at any time to showcase my talents and to stay in shape. Before, I couldn’t work out as much, especially with my knee. I was worried about my knee and overworking it. But now, with it being close to 100 percent, I’m able to do more. Not having to worry about a game and what not, they can push my limits and see how in-shape I can get and try to get better each day, I’m able to work out more. As of right now, I’m lifting really early, like a 6:30 a.m. lift followed by a hoop workout. I get some food, get another workout in during the day, whether it be an hour or two hours later, just trying to work it in around class [too]. I’m just trying to do as much as possible honestly. Anytime I can hoop, I’m definitely taking advantage of it. Anything I can do to get better.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Speaking of the next level, is there anything you have lined up in regard to making the transition to the pro ball?</strong><br>\nGV: I’m kind of in this limbo of being ready whenever my number may be called and waiting to see what happens in the next few months here. I’ve hired an agent. I’m in the finalizing stages of that. Getting that moving forward and having someone to speak on my behalf soon will be great. I’m just trying to get ready for hopefully any league workouts I can get, and just to be prepared for what comes next in the summer. Right now, I’m just preparing for that next step and trying to set things up. It’s really interesting for me, as someone who is not anticipating to be drafted. Everything is kind of slow for a while, then things start happening really quickly and you get those answers you’re searching for.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: It’s a known fact that UCSB isn’t a sports powerhouse. Given that fact, your journey to playing professionally may possibly be more challenging than expected. Is that potential challenge something you anticipate and will embrace? Does it kind of put a chip on your shoulder?</strong><br>\nGV: “A little bit. Coming to this school, I knew that would be something I would have to deal with down the road. I didn’t exactly have the career in many ways that I wanted to. I think coming back this year with my injury kind of held me back numbers wise from the numbers kind of year that I could’ve had. That definitely hurts me moving forward to this spring and summer. But with that being said, at the end of the day, it’s all about who can play and who can perform. I knew that coming into Santa Barbara, and it’s part of the reason I came here because I wanted to go somewhere where I could get better. I think I’ve done that. I’m just trying to get better, and continue to work on my craft and perfect it.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: Have you reached out to any past Gauchos that are currently playing professional ball? Have you sought any type of advice?</strong><br>\nGV: “Absolutely. I’ve been close to some guys since I committed to UCSB. I’ve been close with Michael Bryson, who is in the NBA G League right now, James Nunnally, he’s overseas now, Orlando Johnson as well. Those are the three people I’ve been in contact with, and they’ve always been good during my whole four years here. They’ve reached out and checked in on me, and have given advice here and there. They’ve been good resources for me, and a good a part of this Gaucho family.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: If you could talk to the younger Gabe, is there one particular thing you’d like to mention? Any advice or lesson learned that you have now that would be significant enough?</strong><br>\nGV: “That’s a tough question for me. I’ve always been a little more mature than my peers around me and a little more professional with how I carry myself. I think I would give advice to trust the process. That everything you do affects the way things are going to be. Everything I do now, every decision I make now, in my mind, I’m making as a pro. If it’s not going to make me better as a pro, then it’s like, ‘why would I go do that?’ Whether it helps my mentality, my body [is important]. I would try to push that mindset on myself at a younger age, which I think I had a little bit of, but obviously as you get older it becomes more serious and you’re closer to being at that level. These are all of the sorts of things I would tell myself in hopes that I would listen as a young kid and take that advice.”</p>\n<p><strong>SW: In one word, who is Gabe Vincent?</strong><br>\nGV: “Wow. That’s a tough question. I’m going to need a second here.”<br>\n“I would say leader.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 12th</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

How was the transition from college to overseas?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Eric Childress: </strong>Playing in the British Basketball League was pretty difficult. I say this only because I feel like the club I was with had the potential to be very talented, but we underperformed and many different circumstances made it hard for us to reach our potential. The transition from college to overseas, I’d say, can be different for every person depending on the country you land in. For me, going to the U.K., I was very fortunate in going to a place where everyone spoke English and it was the most similar to the U.S. With that being said, if I were to start my career somewhere in Asia, South America or even here in Georgia I think I would have struggled at first because of the language barrier and it being such a big culture shock. It’s hard for me to just maneuver around town like I was in Leeds.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Did you get in touch with any former Gauchos who play or have played overseas prior to starting your pro career?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>Yeah, prior to leaving I talked to players like James Nunally &amp; Orlando Johnson, who came back to Santa Barbara during the summer, and kind of picked their brains about the whole overseas experience. Also, it’s easier for me to get in contact with Alan Williams, Nate Garth, Zalmico Harmon and Michael Bryson, so whenever I have a big question that I feel like I can’t really get on my own I’ll reach out and see if they can offer me some advice from their experiences.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: How did you know at the time that Leeds Force was the right fit for you? Did you have an agent help with that choice?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>I feel like you never really know which team is the right fit until you get there. You kind of watch film of the league and past seasons, but ultimately the guys you see from the last season are likely gone to another country or [have] signed with another team in the league. When I got to Leeds I had no clue what I was getting myself into. We had, of course, your local players for the team, and many imports, as they call us, from different places such as Houston and Florida in the States, then a player for Greece, one from Switzerland, one from Lithuania and one from Germany. So it’s more on the club to make sure our playing styles complement each other when they offer us to play for them. My choice to go play for Leeds was made by my agent and me. We felt like the U.K. was a good starting place for me to go because of the similarities to the U.S., and the British Basketball League (BBL) is a good league with many talented players.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: I see you’re no longer a member of Leeds Force? Was that by choice or was it a matter of both sides just not being able to agree?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>After giving Leeds a shot, the club and I both agreed that things weren’t going in the direction we hoped for and mutually decided to go our separate ways. I wish those guys the best over there for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: You played with guys like Alan “Big Al” Williams, Michael Bryson and more. How often do you stay in touch with them? Do you ever seek advice from them for anything?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>One of the greatest things about UCSB — and I commend Coach Williams for this — was that he brought in some of the best dudes I’ll ever meet. With that being said, I speak to pretty much all my teammates from the past days because of the old group chats that we had in college and are still active in. As far as advice, I try to figure out some stuff on my own. If I can’t get it and [am] really struggling, then I’ll reach out to them or even old high school family such as my coaches and old teammates and see what advice they can offer me in this experience.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Have you had a chance to peep this year’s men’s basketball team? If so, what have your thoughts been especially since the program now has a new head coach in Joe Pasternack?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>This year’s team has been amazing. I’m really happy for those guys that had to go through that tough season last year and [am] juiced for Gabe [Vincent] to be out there performing great after that injury last year. Glad to see Jalen [Canty] and Ami [Lakoju] out there on the floor after their situation last year as well. I can’t even lie: I was jealous, and I told them this when watching them play against Cal State Fullerton this year. Their play style differs so much from ours last year that it really seems like those dudes that are on the floor are genuinely having fun with the game, and I feel like the most important [thing] is having fun while competing at a high level. I’m happy they adjusted to Coach P’s system so quickly, and I think he did an outstanding job with those guys with getting them to compete on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: What’s next for Eric Childress? I see you’ve recently announced your signing with a team in the country of Georgia; what convinced you to do so?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>Yes, I recently signed to play and finish my rookie year here in Batumi, Georgia with BC Batumi. The biggest thing was that I didn’t want what happened in Leeds to affect my love for the game. I’ve been playing and giving my all to this sport for as long as I can remember, and it’s always been a dream of mine to be a professional basketball player. That was the biggest choice in deciding to come here and continue on. What also factored in was realizing that I get to travel the world, see many different places and cultures, try different things and gain new experiences that many people aren’t fortunate [enough] to do, so I’m blessed to even have this opportunity.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>SW: Any good or unfamiliar meals overseas that you liked or disliked?</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EC: </strong>As for as meals go, I’m one of the pickiest eaters you’ll ever meet.

\r\n</script> \n<p>While “mid-major” athletic programs that have less prestige and national exposure have been around for decades, the growing stardom of Power 5 conferences has led to the gradual dwarfing of these less prestigious schools.</p>\n<p>Over the years, and even in today’s college sports, it is the “Cinderella story” accomplishments of these lower tier programs that make the landscape of college sports that much better.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s the recent undefeated run put together by the Central Florida football team, a team that was winless just two years ago, or seeing a low-seeded team knock off a top contender during March Madness, it is clear fans love these underdog stories.</p>\n<p>As a member of the Big West, UCSB is part of one of the nation’s 25 “mid-major” conferences.</p>\n<p>The term “mid-major” is typically applied to football and basketball ranks; however, in recent years it has become even more universal.</p>\n<p>While mid-major athletics programs have been around for decades, the reality of the growing stardom of Power 5 conferences has resulted in the gradual dwarfing of these less prestigious schools.</p>\n<p>Similar to many other mid-major programs, UCSB tends to find itself being overlooked within the college sports realm.</p>\n<p>Surely, attractions such as the beach and academics are influential upon UCSB receiving attention amongst the masses.</p>\n<p>They’re even features that help to recruit prospective athletes as well.</p>\n<p>While both are enticing, the lack of having what many would consider a “big name” on the college sports map certainly is a challenge that affects UCSB both on and off the field.</p>\n<p>As a sports fan, the image of attending a game in which the arena or stadium bleachers are filled to capacity was an experience I hoped for.</p>\n<p>Of course, once I submitted my Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) for UCSB, which gives you a sense of how nerve-wracking the recruiting process must be for student-athletes, it was quickly evident that my vision was unlikely to occur.</p>\n<p>Let’s face facts.</p>\n<p>As we all know UCSB, is not a sports powerhouse.</p>\n<p>Not to dismiss the record-breaking attendance numbers for UCSB men’s soccer matches versus Blue-Green rival Cal Poly or even when the Gauchos go head-to-head with the Mustangs in men’s basketball, but the occurrence of these contests occurring twice per season for both sports just isn’t enough.</p>\n<p>Excluding those who follow UCSB sports, many students are even unaware that our school has Division I status.</p>\n<p>In an era of college sports when the destinations of some of the nation’s five-star, McDonald’s All-American and ESPN Top 300 athletes are plastered and glamorized in storylines nationwide, UCSB isn’t home to much of that glitz and glamour.</p>\n<p>But this is what makes UCSB sports special.</p>\n<p>Simply put, it’s the little things that go a long way and speak for themselves.</p>\n<p>While currently in the middle of my fourth year, the chance to observe the accomplishments of different teams has been a wonderful process to witness.</p>\n<p>These accomplishments have been achieved by teams such as men’s soccer, which nearly upset No. 2 seeded Clemson in the Sweet 16 back in 2015.</p>\n<p>This was followed by baseball’s ‘Chomaha’ College World Series run after upsetting No. 2 seeded Louisville in 2016. Along with those two, 2016 also became the year the women’s water polo team won its first Big West tournament title in program history.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, nobody can take away the fact that you’re a winner, regardless of the scale that success took place on.</p>\n<p>Each of the aforementioned wins are UCSB’s own version of “Cinderella” stories, forever cemented in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>UCSB has two national championships in its history — the first by its 1979 UCSB men’s water polo team and the last by its men’s soccer team over UCLA in the 2006 Men’s College Cup.</p>\n<p>Only time will tell what’s in store for UCSB sports in the coming years. Hey, who knows, maybe UCSB’s opportunity to host the 2018 and 2020 Men’s College Cups will bring about some extra motivation and mojo that results in another title for the Gaucho faithful.</p>\n<p>As a senior, I won’t physically be here for that future.</p>\n<p>However, the underdog nature of UCSB sports will always stick with me, and of course, I’ll continue to follow each sport’s success year in and year out in hopes of a big run.</p>\n<p>In the case of mid-major programs like UCSB’s, there’s added motivation to surpass the usually underestimated standard that is placed on them.</p>\n<p>With that being said, the Power 5 conferences may have the better talent according to rankings and other measureables.</p>\n<p>But heart and effort can’t be measured. And those are two things that will always outperform talent.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Dec. 7</em><em>, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80076\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80076\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-12-07/survival-of-the-fittest-mid-majors-flex-their-muscles-too/","id":3381,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[3380,3379,3378],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Secret Life of Jerseys: An Alum’s Quest to Rep UCSB Men’s Soccer","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Collage_for20171130.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Collage_for20171130.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Life as a Gaucho doesn't last for just four years.

In the case of Gaucho alumnus Mike Heid, class of 1995 graduate, his affinity for UCSB men’s soccer has formed a community between both current and incoming Gaucho sports fans and veterans that have been around for decades.</p>\n<p>Heid is the creator of <em>gauchosoccer.com</em>, a blog with ties to nearly any and all things related to UCSB men’s soccer.</p>\n<p>According to the website’s archives tab, information on the site dates back as early as Sept. 2016.</p>\n<p>Insight on current and former Gauchos that are now playing at either the MLS or international pro levels, the program’s 2018 recruiting class and even the formations and plays the team ran while on the field are all available on Heid’s site.</p>\n<p>Although intriguing, the website’s most striking piece of content is Heid’s self-titled “How I Procured My Own UCSB Soccer Jersey: A Case Study in Citizen Journalism.”</p>\n<p>With little to lose as an avid UCSB men’s soccer fan looking to further support his alum, Heid took his right to citizen journalism beyond the keyboard and into public records to satisfy his need for a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Despite being home to 20 Division-I sports programs, UCSB is not necessarily a sports powerhouse.</p>\n<p>With that said, the search for a team jersey in any sport is a likely afterthought for many, but not all.</p>\n<p>While browsing <em>ucsbgauchos.com</em>, one would likely come across the athletics department’s “UCSB shop” tab and would eventually find their way onto its Gauchos Shop.<br>\nCategorized under the site’s “men’s jersey” tab, the only available jerseys for purchase are for baseball and men’s basketball.</p>\n<p>Published on Nov. 4, Heid’s article chronicles his search to purchase a UCSB men’s soccer jersey, a seven-month process that began in April of this year.</p>\n<p>Trailblazing Heid’s investigation was a question about the availability of purchasing a men’s soccer jersey on the UCSB sub-Reddit a while back, influencing him to exhaust all of his possible resources in hopes of finding an answer.</p>\n<p>“For years, I’ve wanted to buy UCSB soccer jerseys. Every year I go to the Gaucho shop and jersey section, and every year it’s the same stuff. There was one year when they did sell the actual jersey, which I still have, but [nothing else since].”</p>\n<p>One of his first steps was reaching out to staff within the UCSB athletics department.</p>\n<p>His exchange of emails primarily took place with Richard Loza, director of Marketing, Branding and Sales and Bryan Cornet, the department’s assistant athletics director of Sales and External Relations.</p>\n<p>In an email sent to Cornet, Heid even offered to put up his own money for the UCSB athletics department to use in hopes of them buying the jerseys and putting them up for sale.</p>\n<p>He proposed the idea that if the jerseys didn’t bring in any revenue, he would accept the loss and not get his money back. If the jerseys were to sell, he would make his money back and the department would keep the profit.</p>\n<p>Due to university regulations, the school was unable to accept the offer. But it wasn’t this fact alone that prompted Heid to continue his investigation.</p>\n<p>Rather, it was the estimated costs to produce the jerseys that seemed most contradictory. With Nike as the university’s sponsor at the time, prior to changing to Adidas, Heid was informed that the athletics department ordered “custom” jerseys that cost around $180 a piece.</p>\n<p>For any sports fan, the only merchandise that likely hits that market price or higher is an authentic NBA Hardwood Classics jersey, a pair of retro Michael Jordan sneakers or some other form of ultra-vintage memorabilia.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the price just didn’t add up.</p>\n<p>As expected, the $180 price tag suggested definitely caught Heid off guard, considering his history as a consumer of both authentic and replica soccer jerseys.</p>\n<p>The price, paired with dwindling communication with the athletics department, led to Heid filing a public records request to verify the information he had been given about the production of the jerseys.</p>\n<p>His request was to receive information about the men’s soccer program’s purchases from the past three years, in addition to the contract UCSB Athletics had with Nike.</p>\n<p>Once his request was fulfilled and the invoices were delivered, the claim that the jerseys cost $180 was quickly disproven as UCSB was actually paying $30-40 for each jersey, which was a discounted cost nearly half the retail price.</p>\n<p>Considering UCSB’s switch from Nike to Adidas, Heid ended up filing another public records request regarding the team’s costs for jerseys by the new sponsor.</p>\n<p>From May 31 throughout August, Heid was left empty-handed with no records as he was told that there were no invoices or receipts for jerseys under the new partnership.</p>\n<p>“I made two separate requests. For my second request, I had to do about 10 follow-ups,” he said. “I don’t think Athletics was necessarily caught off guard that I was up to something and maybe verifying what they had told me. Maybe they were caught off guard with what I did with the info. But I also didn’t want the whole thing to turn adversarial. I was a little afraid that I would ostracize myself from the process.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until Aug. 29 when Heid received order confirmation documents for both the team’s home and away jerseys. But the documentation only went so far, as Heid ended up reaching out to Adidas and eventually was put in touch with a retail vendor.</p>\n<p>Communication with Adidas was the peak of Heid’s investigation. Similar to the Nike partnership, UCSB’s new deal with Adidas also consisted of jersey prices being within the $40 range and served as the deciding factor for him purchasing a wholesale amount of blue and white jerseys on Sept. 21. He received his order on Nov. 3.</p>\n<p>With the promise that he was willing to donate to UCSB, he bought a total of 64 authentic UCSB men’s soccer jerseys, spending a total amount of $2,958.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79951\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2110208514\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79946\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79951\" data-attachment-id=\"79951\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/the-secret-life-of-jerseys-an-alums-quest-to-rep-ucsb-mens-soccer/jersey-story-receipt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?fit=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"805,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jersey story receipt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?fit=197%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?fit=805%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79951\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt-805x1024.jpg?resize=450%2C572\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"572\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?w=805&amp;ssl=1 805w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?resize=197%2C250&amp;ssl=1 197w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jersey-story-receipt.jpg?resize=768%2C977&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79951\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Receipt courtesy of Mike Heid</p></div>\n<p>With UCSB Athletics uninterested in selling the jerseys and Heid’s cautiousness for trademark violations, he ended up giving them away to former players and fans that held UCSB soccer dear to their hearts similar to him.</p>\n<p>Although Heid was able to confirm his skepticism about the production costs of the jersey, his agenda wasn’t to one up the athletics department and prove them wrong.</p>\n<p>Instead, the former Gaucho is one of many that truly love the UCSB men’s soccer program and created an investigation that was dedicated to further connecting the team to its supporters.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about athletics making money from [the jerseys],” Heid said. “It’s also about the fans getting what they want and the program getting more visibility.

Signing after the Gauchos’ tournament run was junior guard Akilah Jennings, who transferred to UCSB after one year at Northern Colorado and one season at Foothill College.</p>\n<p>Redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar, who sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules after her departure from Seattle University, will be making her Gaucho debut this year.<br>\nUpon entering Saturday’s matchup, UCSB was tabbed to finish third in the Big West standings in both of the conference’s preseason coaches’ and media polls.</p>\n<p>Presuming that its starters will play for only the first quarter at most, Santa Barbara’s exhibition will serve as more of an experimentation period with its lineup considering some players will be sidelined.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting and a good opportunity for us to play somebody else. The third chapter might start with a bunch of Band-Aids on it because we’re a little dinged up, but at least it’s November,” Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. “We’re going to hold Drew [Edelman] out because she’s got a right thumb that’s been sore. We’ve got a couple more bodies in that we didn’t have a week ago so we’re still a work in progress. For those that have been out and are coming back in, [the most important thing] is for them to get some reps and be in practice every day as their growth continues.”</p>\n<p>According to Henrickson, other Gauchos who have experienced offseason injuries and are gradually making their way back include sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez, Bates and Quintino.</p>\n<p>While exhibition games typically result in a Division I program facing some lower-tiered Division II, III or even less reputable schools, the Gauchos are going against one of their best preseason opponents of the Henrickson era on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Cal State East Bay enters the 2017-18 season with momentum following a 22-9, 16-4 CCAA record with the guidance of then first-year Head Coach Shanele Stires. Within the past two years, the Pioneers have made back-to-back Division II NCAA tournament appearances after capturing consecutive CCAA women’s basketball tournament titles.</p>\n<p>East Bay won 11 of its last 12 regular season games going into the CCAA tournament, where it won three straight games to win the title before losing to Western Washington in the first round of the DII NCAA West Regional.</p>\n<p>How CSU East Bay will do on the offensive end is most intriguing following the loss of former guard Shomari Harris, who led both the CCAA and Pioneers in scoring with 17 points per game (PPG). Another senior that will be missed is former center Remy Puou, who was the team’s second leading scorer with 10.2 PPG.</p>\n<p>Despite its DII status, East Bay presents a challenge that could possibly deliver an exhibition game that possesses a regular season feel, which is competition the Gauchos are ready to embrace.</p>\n<p>“When you’re scheduling [games dating back] a year ago, considering our anticipation of returning to the Big West tournament, it’s the right thing to do [to challenge ourselves],” Henrickson said. “We’re going to play against some players that we haven’t seen in their system. We’re trying to dig up some film on what they looked like last year. There’s going to be some things that we’re going to see that we’re not going to be able to anticipate. But then that’s where the use of timeouts and communicating in huddles help to make some adjustments on the fly.”</p>\n<p>With very little weighing on the outcome of Saturday’s exhibition, not much pressure is on UCSB, who won’t be at full health when they compete. With just one preseason game before its regular season tip-off, the Gauchos still have a chance to set a precedent as to what they hope to become this year.</p>\n<p>The exhibition between UCSB and CSUEB will take place in the Thunderdome at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Nov. 2, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79495\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79495\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-02/gauchos-prepare-for-preseason-showdown-with-csu-east-bay/","id":601,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[600,599,598],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball Team Takes a Humble Approach to Start the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-31-at-1.15.36-AM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-31-at-1.15.36-AM.png?resize=859%2C539&ssl=1","description":"With the official start to its 2017-18 season just weeks away, the UCSB women's basketball team is hoping to remain consistent going into its third year of the Bonnie Henrickson era.

By the grace of the ball clanking off the rim’s lip after a left corner three-point shot by Porter, the 49ers defeated the Gauchos 56-55.</p>\n<p>Despite the heart wrenching loss, the Gauchos will enter the new season with a confidence knowing that they’re capable of making that next big step: an NCAA Tournament appearance.</p>\n<p>“Pressure is a privilege. It’s nice to talk about the expectations. But I have to go back to Coach [Mark] French, and I’m a caretaker of a program that man built. We walk by 14 [Big West] trophies every day,” Henrickson said. “Concerning the ‘expectation,’ as a staff, we’ve done a good job of not talking about how the championship game ended. If that’s all we talk about, then you don’t have time to talk about culture, competitiveness, character and unselfishness, which are all of the things that gave us a chance at the end. [Of course] our players have an expectation to have a great year which comes about from the hard work it takes. Part of the excitement with this senior group and Sarah as a junior is how much they’ve gotten better since we’ve left Anaheim to now. For us, it’s about getting better every day.”</p>\n<p>Excluding what takes place on the court, each of the mentioned qualities truly does stick with each player and their mindset.</p>\n<p>Making the difference for Porter, who sat out in Henrickson’s debut year due to NCAA transfer rules, has been one specific dimension of the team’s dynamic: Culture.</p>\n<p>“Since day one, Coach Bonnie has talked about turning the program’s culture around,” Porter said. “She and the coaching staff have done so. I’m excited for the freshmen on the team because they’re joining a program that is going to make them better both on and off the court.”</p>\n<p>During the time in which she sat out, Porter was able to witness this culture manifest itself from the ground up. Usually displaying a reserved yet competitive demeanor while on the court, Porter’s poise are elements that have been further developed by Henrickson’s culture since being at the helm.</p>\n<p>It’s a characteristic that resonates throughout the program from top to bottom.</p>\n<p>As the leader of the pack, following a year in which she led both UCSB in scoring (11.7 points per game) and the Big West in field goal percentage (61.4), Edelman senses that the Gauchos’ potential still sustains much upside.</p>\n<p>“Last year was a rebuilding year. This year is totally different,” she said. “We have such better attitudes going around, better energy and everyone is working well together. Last year I didn’t want to overstep my [boundaries] since I was new and I didn’t really know how the team played together yet. This year, I feel more comfortable with being more comfortable on the court and having people look to me for advice while I also look to other people.”</p>\n<p>Such anticipation hasn’t surrounded the Gauchos’ women’s basketball program since its heydays of running the Big West within the past two decades dating back to 1991.</p>\n<p>While no guarantees are in place for UCSB to make a return to the NCAA Tournament, it is evident that the team’s players and personnel have fully bought into the belief that anything is possible heading into year three with Coach Bonnie.</p>\n<p>UCSB will face Cal State Bakersfield at the Thunderdome in an exhibition on Saturday, Nov. 4 at 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79395\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/womens-basketball-media-day-follow-up-gauchos-taking-a-humble-approach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79395\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/womens-basketball-media-day-follow-up-gauchos-taking-a-humble-approach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/womens-basketball-media-day-follow-up-gauchos-taking-a-humble-approach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/womens-basketball-media-day-follow-up-gauchos-taking-a-humble-approach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-30/womens-basketball-media-day-follow-up-gauchos-taking-a-humble-approach/","id":585,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[584,583,582],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blast From the Past: Rookie Flashbacks of Today’s NBA Stars","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nbablogbig.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nbablogbig.jpg?resize=980%2C623&ssl=1","description":"The 2017-18 NBA season is among us.

The initial thought was to join the wave of “bold predictions” concerning who would be this year’s NBA champion, MVP, scoring champion, Rookie of the Year, etc.<br>\nBut then it hit me.<br>\n“How did today’s NBA stars fare in each of their debuts?”<br>\nThe talent of current NBA rookies Lonzo Ball, Markelle Fultz, Jayson Tatum, De’Aaron Fox, Ben Simmons and others has brought about one of the most hyped draft classes in years, possibly since the 2003 NBA Draft. Now, it’s time to explore the journeys of players who were once in their shoes and are now at the top of the game.<br>\nIn honor of the return of NBA basketball, here is a list of today’s biggest names and how they did in their introductions to the league.</p>\n<p><strong>LeBron James: Oct. 29, 2003 – Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Sacramento Kings</strong><br>\nIt was during LeBron James’s senior year of high school at St. Vincent-St. Mary’s that he tattooed “Chosen 1” on his upper back after being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Getting such ink is likely something many would deem as risky, but “King James” has lived up to the moniker as one of the best ever, as he just began his 15th NBA season.<br>\nStill, to this day, we have yet to see any other high school player with the buzz LeBron had leading up to his NBA arrival.<br>\nLeBron didn’t disappoint in his first NBA game, finishing with a stat line of 25 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four steals in 42 minutes of play, but was defeated 106-92.<br>\nThe chase for ring No. 4 has begun. With no Kyrie Irving and the additions of Dwyane Wade, Isaiah Thomas, Derrick Rose and others, another tough journey lies ahead for King James and the Cavs, as it’s logical to assume that they have one thing on their minds: to find a way to defeat the Golden State Warriors.</p>\n<p><strong>Steph Curry: Oct. 28, 2009 – GS Warriors vs. Houston Rockets</strong><br>\nAt the core of the Warriors’ dethronement of the King and co. in two of the last three NBA Finals series is Stephen Curry. It’s no question that Curry is the greatest shooter of all time. From breaking the NBA’s single-game record of three-pointers made with 13 last season to surpassing the NBA’s single-season record for three-pointers made a total of three times, in addition to becoming the only player to ever make 300 and 400-plus threes in a season, Curry’s numbers need no explanation.<br>\nKnown for his sharpshooter ability at Davidson College, Curry’s first NBA game was a convincing performance. It was an efficient game by Curry, as he went 7-of-12 from the field to score 14 points, dished out seven assists and snagged four steals in a narrow 108-107 loss. Most surprisingly, he went 0-1 from beyond the arc. Aren’t we grateful that the world of analytics wasn’t as prevalent then as it is today? Boy, would they have been proven wrong.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo: Oct. 30, 2013 – Milwaukee Bucks vs. NY Knicks</strong><br>\nThe youngest player of the 2013 NBA Draft, the then 18-year-old Giannis Antetokounmpo was a mystery for most coming out of the Greek professional basketball club Filathlitikos.<br>\nHis body and build showed signs of a stretch forward who had the length yet lacked the bulk. Uncertainty loomed even more after Antetokounmpo played just 4:43 minutes and scored one point from the free-throw line with no shot attempts in his NBA debut, which concluded with a 90-83 defeat.<br>\nBut that performance wasn’t the end of the tale for Antetokounmpo.<br>\nIt was the start of a star whom we all know as “The Greek Freak.”<br>\n“The Greek Freak, I think, is a force. I’ve never seen anything like him. His ceiling is probably … he could end up being the best player to ever play if he really wanted to. That’s pretty scary to think about. He’s by far my most favorite player to watch.”<br>\nThose are the words of Golden State’s Kevin Durant, who made such claims in a video on his YouTube channel.<br>\nThey’re words that were earned, as Antetokounmpo is coming off his best career year after becoming a first-time NBA All-Star and the first player ever to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all major stats (points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks).<br>\nKD is right; Antetokounmpo’s ceiling has no limits at the ripe, pre-prime age of 22. Who knows, the Greek Freak just might fulfill Kobe Bryant’s challenge of winning the NBA MVP award.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin Durant: Oct. 31, 2007 – Seattle Supersonics vs. Denver Nuggets</strong><br>\nThe first glimpse into the current wave of stretch forwards begins with Kevin Durant. While the impact of length had been witnessed with legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain, and the ability to handle the ball with craft was displayed by players such Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Allen Iverson, Durant introduced an unorthodox skillset — a near seven-foot stature with the ability to do it all on the court.<br>\nRight out the gates in his first career game, the then 19-year-old was looking to make an immediate impact as he ended with 22 shot attempts. He finished with 18 points with seven made field goals, five rebounds, three steals and a block in a 120-103 loss to a Denver team that had both Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson record a combined 57 points.<br>\nThe current state of KD’s career is at its full peak after his decision to join the Golden State Warriors last offseason. Despite the critics, Durant is now an NBA champion and NBA Finals MVP and has convinced many that he is the league’s best player.</p>\n<p><strong>James Harden: Oct. 28, 2009 – OKC Thunder vs. Sacramento Kings</strong><br>\nWhether it be from long range or a quick hesi-eurostep, Harden is one the NBA’s most lethal offensive players.<br>\nUpon entering the league, he was drafted into one of the best situations possible with his teammates being Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.<br>\nHow Harden would fit within that puzzle was a concern.<br>\nBefore becoming the star player we know today as “The Beard,” his growth began with his transition to the pros.<br>\nIt was a slow start for Harden, whose playing time was capped at 13 minutes and included five points on 2-of-2 shooting, 1-of-1 from behind the three-point line and two rebounds in a 102-89 win.<br>\nSince joining the Houston Rockets, Harden has become one of the NBA’s ultimate stars and is coming off a year during which he averaged 29.1 points, 11.2 assists and 8.1 rebounds per game — all career highs.<br>\nClaims that Harden has been snubbed twice for the NBA MVP award still ring, but after helping lead the Rockets to their 122-121 win over the Warriors, he and Houston could possibly be a true contender in the West.</p>\n<p><strong>Kawhi Leonard: Dec. 26, 2011 – SA Spurs vs. Memphis Grizzlies</strong><br>\nThe late start was a result of the 2011 NBA lockout that took place. Most notably, the Indiana Pacers must regret trading Kawhi Leonard to the Spurs.<br>\nOverlooked in his draft class due to questions surrounding his offensive potential, Leonard turned out to be the biggest steal of the draft and is now within the conversation of being the game’s next best player.<br>\nSimilar to some others on this list, his first game didn’t make a profound statement.<br>\nComing off the bench in the Spurs’ 95-82 defeat of Memphis, Leonard concluded his debut with six points on 2-of-9 shooting along with six rebounds, two steals and an assist.<br>\nA reserved, humble spirit who lets his play do all the talking, Leonard remained low on many fans’ and experts’ radars until his emergence in the 2014 NBA Finals. He ended the championship series averaging 17.8 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game to win the NBA Finals MVP award.<br>\nHis postseason performance was the birth of a star, as he went on to embrace a bigger role for the Spurs and is now the team’s No. 1 option after putting up a career-high scoring average of 25.5 PPG last season.<br>\nIn spite of being ruled out of the Spurs’ Wednesday season opener, “The Klaw” seems to be on a path to greatness as he prepares for another year as San Antonio’s leading man.</p>\n<p><strong>Russell Westbrook: Oct. 29, 2008 – OKC Thunder vs. Milwaukee Bucks</strong><br>\nSince day one, Westbrook has been known for his relentless, Looney Tunes “Tasmanian Devil” motor. His first full season without KD left many favoring the likelihood of the Thunder plummeting to the bottom half of the Western Conference.<br>\nRather than sink, Westbrook made history and won the NBA MVP award after breaking NBA legend Oscar Robertson’s single-season triple double-record of 41 by finishing last season with 42 and becoming the first player since Robertson to average a triple-double (31.6 PPG, 10.4 APG, 10.7 RPG).<br>\nRewinding back to the first game of his rookie year, he had 13 points, four assists, four rebounds and one block in a 98-87 loss.<br>\nWestbrook can produce for a team on his own, but he did need more help. That help has arrived with OKC’s additions of stars Paul George and Carmelo Anthony.</p>\n<p><strong>Anthony Davis: Oct. 31, 2012 – New Orleans Hornets vs. SA Spurs</strong><br>\nThe process of being drafted by a rebuilding franchise has been a long, challenging journey for Anthony Davis, who has one playoff appearance under his belt.<br>\nHowever, “The Brow” has proven that he belongs in the NBA and showcased this in his career debut.<br>\nHe made the most of his 29 minutes, having tallied 21 points on a 6-of-12 shooting performance all while collecting seven rebounds, one steal and one block apiece, but the team still lost 99-95.</p>\n<p><strong>Damian Lillard: Oct. 31, 2012 – Portland Trailblazers vs. LA Lakers</strong><br>\nComing out of Weber State, Damian Lillard has and still does rock a chip on his shoulder as he embraces the underdog role of being underrated throughout his career.<br>\nHe and the Trailblazers hosted the Lakers, who at the time had Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard and Steve Nash on their team.<br>\nDame showed no fear and managed to overcome six turnovers as he broke out for a night that consisted of scoring 23 points, 11 assists, three rebounds and one steal. His strong performance helped lead Portland to a 116-106 victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Kyrie Irving: Dec. 26, 2011 – Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Toronto Raptors</strong><br>\nFollowing “The Decision” of LeBron James to leave Cleveland for the Miami Heat, the Cavaliers were in search of their next superstar.<br>\nWith the No. 1 pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, Kyrie Irving was the team’s selection to be the face of its franchise.<br>\nThe pressure may have gotten to Irving in his debut as he finished with six points on 2-of-12 shooting, seven assists, three rebounds and one steal in the Cavs’ 104-96 loss.<br>\nJames’s return in 2014 led to the pairing of him and Irving, which resulted in their success of winning one NBA title in three years of playing with each other prior to Irving having his trade request granted this past summer, landing him in Boston.<br>\nTuesday night was just the beginning of the “Uncle Drew-King James” saga that will continue to build hype as the season progresses.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 19, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79181\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79181\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/blast-from-the-past-rookie-flashbacks-of-todays-nba-stars/","id":1881,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1880,1879,1878],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Power Plays: Trump and the NFL’s Attempt to Silence Protest Won’t Work","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2017-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sportsnfl.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sportsnfl.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Even on the field, there's no equal level playing field in America.

While no executive order has been implemented, the same oppressive nature is being reproduced by Trump’s attempt to silence the voices of NFL players who are currently protesting social injustice, racial inequality and Trump’s objective to have them taken off the field for protesting as his tweets suggest.</p>\n<p>The recent NFL events that have taken place this week display an attempt to force “athletes to stick to sports.”</p>\n<p>Supporting such a message have been the actions of the world’s 12th and 19th richest sports team owners: Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and the leader of ‘America’s Team,’ the Dallas Cowboys, owner Jerry Jones.</p>\n<p>Prior to the kickoff of the Dolphins’ Week Five matchup vs the Tennessee Titans, Ross spoke about his stance on player protest and the impact he believes Trump has had, claiming that the President has “changed that whole paradigm of what protest is. And I think it’s incumbent upon the players today, because of how the public is looking at it, to really stand and really salute the flag,” per the <em>SunSentiel’s </em>Chris Perkins.</p>\n<p>Jones spoke with no filter, expressing his expectations that, “If there is anything disrespecting the flag, then we will not play. Period. We’re going to respect the flag and I’m going to create the perception of it,” according to Brandon George of the <em>Dallas Morning News, </em>via <em>CBSsports’ </em>Sean Wagner-McGough. The Cowboys owner said such remarks after kneeling with his team in unison the previous week prior to the national anthem being sang, then locked arms with players as they all stood during its performance.</p>\n<p>The sudden change of heart occurs after Jones admitted to having a recent phone call with Trump, claiming that the President was the one to remind him of the league’s Game Operations Manual policy. A policy that doesn’t require but rather suggests that players should stand for the anthem. Jones is also one of eight known owners that donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee.</p>\n<p>Per Kurt Badenhausen, “Nineteen NFL teams are owned by billionaires, led by [Paul] Allen, Shahid Khan ($8.2 billion) of the Jacksonville Jaguars and [Stanley] Kroenke, who also owns the recently relocated Los Angeles Rams. The explosion in NFL values has produced more billionaires than any other league with eight people in the 10-figure net worth club as result of the value of their NFL franchises” (<em>Forbes, </em>March 20, 2017).</p>\n<p>Why state such statistics that seem to have no relevance regarding what either of the aforementioned owners said?</p>\n<p>Because it’s time to flip the narrative, just like they and Trump have.</p>\n<p>For those individuals opposed to NFL players protesting because of their millionaire status, why aren’t team owners with billions of dollars being chastised for “not sticking to sports” as well?</p>\n<p>Critics of the protests have yet to realize that a majority of these owners actually care about avoiding controversy more than respecting the flag in order to sustain one thing: monetary revenue.</p>\n<p>A happy consumer equals more money. Not to mention, a happy sponsor equals more money.</p>\n<p>Jones’ statement included a term that is the tell all of what trying to dissuade players from protesting is really about – “perception.”</p>\n<p>Thus far, an array of individuals, media outlets and fans have fallen victim to the misconception of NFL players protesting the flag.</p>\n<p>Constructing such a misinterpretation has been White America’s ability to manipulate the media.</p>\n<p>Take Vice President Mike Pence, for example, and his latest publicity stunt in which he shortly attended the Indianapolis Colts-San Francisco 49ers game only to depart following the choice of about 20 San Francisco players to kneel during the performance of the national anthem.</p>\n<p>Tweeting his way to glory was Trump, who claims he asked Pence to leave the game if any players kneeled. Pence listened. He also tweeted about his exit.</p>\n<p>His decision to leave will continue to be perceived as staged due to the fact that anyone attending or watching the game knew that player protests were going to take place, and rightfully so.</p>\n<p>Since day one, the primary issue at hand is white supremacists believing they have the right to dictate how black people and other people of color should feel in response to the oppression they endure.</p>\n<p>Don’t believe it? Mike Ditka’s words prove it as he now tries to apologize for claiming that “there has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of.”</p>\n<p>A usual belief of those who feel the flag is being disrespected is that the select players choosing to protest are not appreciating its history and the lives of those who have sacrificed for our country.</p>\n<p>It is a false notion which was never these players purpose as individuals of all skin colors have expressed themselves and protested against inequality.</p>\n<p>Imagine how it feels for someone to just ignore the history, both before and after, of an era such as the Civil Rights Movement with a claim like Ditka did.</p>\n<p>This isn’t anything new, though. It dates back to slavery. But speaking to the sports activism currently taking place, beginning with Colin Kaepernick’s decision to protest racial and social injustice and going to the present moment with voices like Jemele Hill and NFL players that have spoken up: shutting them out? It’s blatantly wrong.</p>\n<p>With no backbone to support such wrongdoing, as Goodell has come out and denounced the player protest while also announcing that he will meet with the league’s owners next week, overcoming being silenced by executive power both internally and externally is becoming an even more challenging feat.</p>\n<p>“The current dispute over the National Anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country,” Goodell said on Tuesday in his call for protests to end.</p>\n<p>The cycle is full circle as both America and the NFL attempt to ignore the realities of social and racial inequality – the real threats that are dividing our nation.</p>\n<p>Presently, much uncertainty revolves around whether or not players will continue to protests, especially for those in Dallas facing the ultimatum of being benched.</p>\n<p>As the powerful words of Assata Shakur say, “We have nothing to lose but our chains.”</p>\n<p>Inequality has been one of the most oppressive “executive powers.” While always prevalent, conversation of its reality continues to reach its peak within sports. Something that was needed.</p>\n<p>Today, the fight for equality continues.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 12, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79086\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79086\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/power-plays-trump-and-the-nfls-attempt-to-silence-protest-wont-work/","id":1873,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1872,1871,1870],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stay Woke!

\r\n</script> \n<p>More specifically, racial equality.</p>\n<p>Sadly, dating back over 400 years leading up to today, racial equality remains underachieved within a country that is led by the institution of white supremacy and the meritocratic, racist, oppressive forces that are attached to it.</p>\n<p>As I wrote this piece, I had no clue as to what angle or narrative I was trying to create. I guess you can say I simply wrote from my heart because it’s just so saddening that a little over a year later, I find myself expressing similar sentiments to the Colin Kaepernick article I wrote. The former NFL quarterback’s initial call to action was his decision to sit on the bench during the National Anthem prior to electing to kneel in future games.</p>\n<p>The purpose of Kaepernick’s protest was to combat racial inequality and social injustice, as he stated, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, Sept. 22, at a rally for Alabama Republican Senate candidate Luther Strange, President Donald Trump suggested that NFL owners should demand to “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’’ in reference to players who have selected to kneel and protest during the anthem.</p>\n<p>As various players responded to his claims via social media, voicing their indifferences and unsurprised reactions, Trump followed up with a series of tweets days after the rally, generally stating that sports fans and this country will not condone players protesting the flag.</p>\n<p>As both a black man and a sports fan, Trump’s statements were no surprise to me as well.</p>\n<p>Although I am disappointed and sickened by such remarks, I feel like I’ve become numb to hearing such irrational and hate-filled words. It’s expected, especially when considering the fact that Trump and others who believe that players are disrespecting the flag do not see the bigger issue at hand.</p>\n<p>The larger issue at hand is that black people and people of color are not treated equally in this country. Nonetheless, this racial inequality isn’t being acknowledged but rather minimized by being framed as a threat to America and its flag.</p>\n<p>For people to mistake Kaepernick’s protest as being aimed at disrespecting the flag or military goes to show why movements such as Black Lives Matter are so relevant, especially as I witness people get more upset over athletes deciding to peacefully protest rather than the innocent lives that are taken on a yearly basis.</p>\n<p>It’s crazy to think how quick fans are to forgive and forget a player’s troubles with domestic violence, substance abuse violations or performance enhancement violations. While I do believe in second chances for certain circumstances, even for the aforementioned cases, to an extent, the fact that race is viewed as a topic that does not belong in connection to sports is ludicrous.</p>\n<p>It is time for us all to wake up!</p>\n<p>No, I do not have a specific solution to end racial inequality. But I do believe that the first step toward making progress begins with acknowledging and combating racism in order to overcome the taboo nature that has made it such a cringe-worthy topic.</p>\n<p>Doing so means that systemic ideologies such as colorblindness, in which we’ve been told that race and skin color don’t matter or that we live in a meritocratic society where everyone is on a level playing field and must put in the work to reach a certain level of so-called “success,” are things that must be stripped of their manipulative powers.</p>\n<p>Excuses that athletes need to “stick to sports” because of the amount of money they make and other claims that discredit today’s protests are just detractors from working towards unity.</p>\n<p>This is why I remain so proud of the NFL athletes who genuinely took a knee or protested in another manner this past Sunday. While I don’t believe that all players who demonstrated a protest were sincere, such actions were significant because, although immediate results will not show, an impact is still gradually being made.</p>\n<p>Whether it ever reaches him or not, I just want to say thank you to Colin Kaepernick for protesting and setting the precedent for what exists today in providing a voice for the voiceless concerning racial inequality. He wasn’t the first and he won’t be the last, but his impact is profound and will last forever.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, my mood is precisely expressed by Detroit Lions’ tight end Eric Ebron:</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_78874\" style=\"width: 619px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/?attachment_id=78874\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-78874\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78874\" data-attachment-id=\"78874\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/stay-woke-but-stay-in-your-own-league/screen-shot-2017-09-27-at-9-28-40-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=1288%2C618&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1288,618\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2017-09-27 at 9.28.40 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=250%2C120&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?fit=888%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-78874\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM-1024x491.png?resize=609%2C292\" alt=\"\" width=\"609\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=1024%2C491&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=250%2C120&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?resize=768%2C368&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-9.28.40-PM.png?w=1288&amp;ssl=1 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tweet Courtesy of Eric Ebron, @Ebron85</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/stay-woke-but-stay-in-your-own-league/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/stay-woke-but-stay-in-your-own-league/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/stay-woke-but-stay-in-your-own-league/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/stay-woke-but-stay-in-your-own-league/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-09-28/stay-woke-but-stay-in-your-own-league/","id":1872,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1871,1870,1869],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucos Set to Begin Big West Conf.

The mark was their best finish to the non-conference schedule since the 2005 season in which they went 10-1.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was swept in the regular season by UCR in 2016, yet managed to sweep the Titans in both meetings. UCSB hasn’t lost to Fullerton since Oct. 19, 2012.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s mix of experienced returners and newcomers has been the most evident culprit of the team’s inconsistencies of maintain leads, minimizing errors, and closing out matches.</p>\n<p>But there’s no ceiling on the Gauchos’ potential as they continue to gel and establish familiarity on the court. Their last match was a sign of that as UCSB recorded a season-high .330 hitting clip and season-low 15 errors in its 3-1 win over Eastern Kentucky.</p>\n<p>Although conference matches lie ahead, gradually paving her way toward becoming a possible Big West Player of the Year candidate after winning Freshman of the Year honors last season is sophomore Lindsey Ruddins. She finished with a season-high .415 hitting percentage in the win against EKU along with 20 kills.</p>\n<p>Ruddins’ consistency at the outside hitter position has led to her becoming one of the nation’s top players. UCSB’s kills leader at 168, the Gauchos’ star player is second in the nation in attacks per set with a 14.09 average.</p>\n<p>Her productivity matches her constant attacks as her 5.25 kills per set average also ranks second in the country. Topping off her placement in the national ranks is her 5.55 points per set average, which is sixth-best.</p>\n<p>Despite Ruddins absence in the team’s 3-1 loss to Cleveland State the past weekend, making a positive statement was freshman middle blocker Nicole Omwanghe. She ended the tournament’s final two matches with a combined total of 22 kills and a .486 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Omwanghe notched a career-high 13 kills to go along with a .435 hitting percentage against Cleveland St. and finished with nine kills and a .571 clip against Eastern Kentucky.</p>\n<p>Sustaining such offensive success heading into Friday’s match against UCR will be no easy feat. The Highlanders are tied with Hawaii for the Big West lead in opponent hitting percentage at a .171 clip, which is greater than the Gauchos’ season average of .155.</p>\n<p>Helping set the foundation to UCR’s stout defense is its ability to defend and earn digs. Riverside owns a conference-leading 17.51 digs per set average to also rank 19<sup>th</sup> in the nation.</p>\n<p>Playing a factor in the Highlanders’ defensive success and making an immediate impact early in her career has been redshirt freshman libero Nicole Rodriguez. Having already earned Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors back in Aug. 20-27, Rodriguez was recently rewarded with conference Freshman of the Week honors for her strong performance at the Denver Invitational.</p>\n<p>In three matches, she accumulated a team-high 46 digs and five aces while also tying her career-high of 23 digs in UCR’s 3-2 win over San Diego State. Rodriguez’ 4.39 digs per set and 180 (update after match) total digs rank fourth and seventh in the Big West, respectively.</p>\n<p>As Rodriguez helps set the stage on defense, aiding the Highlanders on offense is junior setter Chelsea Doyle.</p>\n<p>Doyle was named to the Denver Invitational All-Tournament team after tallying 101 assists on the weekend and 37 digs. Her 11.07 assists per set average ranks second in the Big West and 31<sup>st</sup> in the nation.</p>\n<p>UCSB must find a way to be consistent when attacking on offense in order to have a chance against UCR’s defense.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, UCSB is a little more evenly matched in its matchup against Cal State Fullerton. The Titans are one spot ahead of UCSB in hitting percentage at .158, but are stronger on defense as opponents average a .183 hitting clip.</p>\n<p>Similar to UCR, Cal State Fullerton makes it difficult for opposing teams to establish an efficient attack due to their defensive prowess, specifically their success at digs.</p>\n<p>Fullerton lands at No. 3 in the Big West in digs per set with a 15.92 average.

Whether it be service, attacking or blocking errors, Santa Barbara has had its fair share of self-inflicting mistakes on both sides of the net as it is responsible for a conference-leading 84 errors.</p>\n<p>A majority of these miscues can be attributed to the Gauchos’ mix of experienced and newcomer players adjusting to one another so only time will tell. UCSB is is need of its role players to emerge when opponents begin to key in on it pair of strikers.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the gameplay, containing the streaky start of Gauchos’ outside hitters Lindsay Ruddins and Chloe Allen will be a challenging task.</p>\n<p>Big players step up in big games and Ruddins did exactly that in UCSB’s five-set clash against the No. 15 Florida St. Seminoles last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Ruddins outshined the competition with a career-high 36 kills performance to earn the second all-time slot in UCSB history for single-match kills, two short of former Gaucho Roberta Gehlke’s all-time record of 38 kills.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s redshirt second-year outside stud holds this season’s NCAA-high in single-match kills. Ruddins achievement of the 36 kills mark is a feat that no more than three players have recorded in a match in the past four seasons.</p>\n<p>However, Ruddins did not play in the Gauchos’ last outing against Baylor due to undisclosed reasoning.</p>\n<p>Complementing Ruddins success is Allen, who is coming into her own to begin the season. Already embracing a larger role in her sophomore year, Allen made a splurge facing the Florida St. as well with a career-high 24 kills to complete her double-double of 15 digs. She is the only Gaucho with at least two double-figure kills totals in a match.</p>\n<p>Such momentous play should help further establish the Gauchos search for offensive rhythm. While underestimating an opponent is never a wise judgment, UCSB’s first matchup of the tournament against Montana St. may be the perfect ‘pick me up’ to get things rolling.</p>\n<p>Overlooking the Bobcats would be dangerous as they possess a veteran roster in which 13 of the team’s 16 players have been in the program for two years or less; it is a class that includes six freshmen.</p>\n<p>Currently one match victory away from the .500 mark, Montana St. will hope to steer itself onto a winning track as the history of past seasons have been daunting.</p>\n<p>The Bobcats have not had a winning season since 2012-13, in which they went 15-14, 9-11 in Big Sky play, and have not surpassed more than seven wins since then.</p>\n<p>It has been a process of rebuilding for MSU as former Assistant Coach Daniel Jones is now serving as the program’s interim Head Coach. Making things a little easier for Jones and his staff on the court is the trio of outside hitters the program has.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the triad is a young and fairly fresh group consisting of freshman Evi Wilson alongside sophomores Chase Doughty and Natalie Passeck. Each has at least 20+ kills, providing MSU with an array of scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>Aside from the points scored at the net, it has been the little things that have worked to the advantage of the Bobcats as well. Leading them has been freshman libero Alexis Goroski, and her success from behind the service line.</p>\n<p>MSU recorded 21 service aces in its season opening weekend, making it 33<sup>rd</sup> in the nation in the statistical category. Goroski’s eight service aces tie her for 20<sup>th</sup> in the nation and second in the Big Sky Conference.</p>\n<p>While kills, blocks, and digs typically are the most important advantage to pursue as a team, it seems like the minor dimensions of the match such as errors, service aces and more will determine how both UCSB and Montana St. perform <span data-term=\"goog_785148202\">on Friday</span>.</p>\n<p>The weekend will continue and conclude with doubleheader matches against Pacific and host Utah St.</p>\n<p>Despite the loss of one of the program’s best players in school history, Lexi Elman, who joined U.S. Olympian Elaina Oden as one of only two Tiger players ever to notch 1,200 or more career kills and digs; Pacific has held its own through four matches.</p>\n<p>The Tigers are currently on a two-match winning streak and has been striking the ball with no hesitation to much success. In three of its four matches, Pacific has hit at least a .300+ clip, the highest being .430 in its sweep of Idaho last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, it is a home opening weekend for the Aggies. Utah St. opened its non-conference schedule at the Arkansas Classic.</p>\n<p>Helping guide the Aggies to consecutive wins in the team’s first two matches was senior outside Lauren Anderson.</p>\n<p>Her totals of 41 kills, 4.10 kills per set average, 18 digs, five blocks and five service aces led Utah St. to the tournament’s finale as Anderson was selected to the Arkansas Classis All-Tournament team. She fell one kill short of tying her career-high of 23 kills in a win over Cal State Bakersfield.</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Montana St. at <span data-term=\"goog_785148203\">3 p.m.</span> on Friday, Sept.1.

Still, it was an impressive opening weekend on defense for junior libero Emilia Petrachi as she wrapped up the three-day tourney with 54 kills and a 4.91 digs per set average.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Three of UCSB’s four freshmen – middle blockers Nicole Omwanghe, Kija Rivers, and Amanda Serex – played in the team’s season-opening match. Experimentation with the rotation continued as senior libero Sydney Bast made her debut as an outside hitter while facing Baylor. The Gauchos’ co-captain finished with a team-high nine kills.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">A five-set battle between the Gauchos and Seminoles was UCSB’s best showing before falling short of an upset victory. Despite the team’s loss, the career-topping performances of redshirt sophomore and true sophomore outside hitters Ashley Ruddins and Chloe Allen were amazing to witness as a fan of either team.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The 2016 Big West Freshman of the Year and All-Big West First Team selection, Ruddins further etched her name in program history on Saturday. The star outside hitter set a rally-scoring era record for single-match kills with 36 against Florida St., falling two kills short of tying former Gaucho Roberta Gehlke’s school record 38 kills against Long Beach State on Sept. 30, 1999.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Now a starter to begin the year after a fairly quite freshman season, Allen has capitalized on her increased playing time and was valuable in the Gauchos’ ability to keep the score close against the Seminoles. She notched a new career-high of 24 kills.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Along with being the only Gauchos to record double figures in kills, both Ruddins and Allen ended the match with double-doubles with 18 and 15 digs, respectively.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Constant back-and-forth scoring summed up the first two sets of the Gaucho-Seminole matchup. While tied 9-9, Florida St. embarked on an 8-2 run that would shift the momentum and give it some breathing room to eventually close out the opening set as it held a 17-11 lead and maintained it for a 25-22 set victory to go up 1-0. Providing two kills during the scoring stretch was senior outside hitter Milica Kubura, who tallied a total of 14 kills.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">But the Seminoles advantage would be short lived as the Gauchos won the next two sets of the match. Ruddins and Allen set the foundation to UCSB’s pair of .240+ hitting periods, while Florida St. recorded a team-high seven errors in the third set. A service error by Kubura and an attack error by junior setter Brianne Burket in the match’s third set secured Santa Barbara’s 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Jumping out to a 6-1 lead to begin the fourth set, forcing an FSU timeout, it seemed as if the Gauchos were on their way to one of their biggest triumphs in seasons. Aside from Ruddins and Allen, contributing to the streak as well was Rivers, who had eight kills in the match.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">It wasn’t until a block by both Kubura and freshman middle Deja Williams that the Seminoles earned their first lead 12-11 of the fourth set. They would trail one last time 17-16 before stringing together an 8-2 run to win 25-18 and tie the match 2-2.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Scoring three of the Seminoles’ final five points was senior outside hitter Natasha Calkins. While Kubura set the precedent for FSU’s starting rotation, Calkins emerged as the match’s difference maker off the bench. She recorded a team and career-high of 17 kills.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The final set went down to the wire as neither team could take command over the other as ties reoccurred, leading to one last 13-13 stalemate.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Although Ruddins and Allen continued their consistency, their efforts wouldn’t be enough for a UCSB victory. Emerging late for FSU was Calkins for the Seminoles final two kills of the set before an error by the Gauchos’ Allen handed FSU a 15-13 set victory and 3-2 win.</p>\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><span class=\"contextualExtensionHighlight ms-font-color-themePrimary ms-border-color-themePrimary ident_4428_4548\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">UCSB will search for its first victory of the season at the Utah State Tournament, which is set to take place Sept. 1-2.</span> The Gauchos will face Montana St., Pacific, and host Utah St.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78750\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78750\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-31/gauchos-end-season-opening-weekend-empty-handed-go-0-3-at-baylor-tournament/","id":4981,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[4980,4979,4978],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2017 Nexus Sports Awards – Leading the Gaucho Pack: Bonnie Henrickson and Marty Davis Earn “Nexus” Coach of the Year Awards","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coty.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/coty.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Winning \"Coach of the Year\" were UCSB women's basketball's Bonnie Henrickson and UCSB men's tennis' Marty Davis.

Davis has been a coach for the UCSB tennis team since 2000, and he has done a terrific job. He has been the Big West Conference Coach of the Year a total of nine times and has led the tennis program to 10 Big West titles and NCAA appearances, including the ones during the outstanding year they had this year.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s tennis team went a solid 19-6 this year with Davis at the helm. This included a resounding 5-0 record in conference play and a respectable 6-3 record in home games. They ended their season with a 4-1 loss to the University of Mississippi in the NCAA Championship, but this was not all for nothing. The team showed out all season, and this included a 4-1 win against rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>Davis rallied the troops once again this season, and the team responded with an outstanding performance all year. He showed once again why he is one of the best — if not the best — coaches around and why he was invited to and honored at the ATP finals last year. He has taken the UCSB men’s tennis team from a good team to a great team, and his style of play has the Gauchos performing to the best of their ability, and they seemed to be firing on all cylinders before their loss to Ole Miss. This just shows how Davis has transformed the program and justifies his selection for Coach of the Year.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 7 of the June 8, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78412\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78412\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-leading-the-gaucho-pack-bonnie-henrickson-and-marty-davis-earn-nexus-coach-of-the-year-awards/","id":1208,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[1207,1206,1205],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"2017 Nexus Sports Awards – Under the Radar: Porter & Toler Represent WBB Along With Men’s Soccer’s Feucht as Breakout Stars","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/breakout-gauchos.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/breakout-gauchos.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Huge performances are better when they're least expected.

Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>After a productive sophomore season that resulted in six goals and two assists for the UCSB men’s soccer team, junior midfielder Kevin Feucht dominated the Big West in his penultimate season with the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Feucht took his goal-scoring abilities to a new level after scoring the second most goals in the Big West (11), while racking up the highest goals-per-game average (0.55) in the conference.</p>\n<p>The long, lanky 6’3” midfielder controlled the center of the pitch throughout the season with his aggressive yet finesse style of play.</p>\n<p>Feucht was the runner-up in the Big West in total points (24) and ranked first in points per game (1.20). The Gauchos were 6-4-2 when Feucht recorded a point.</p>\n<p>The German national became the sixth UCSB player ever to score a goal in five straight games as he helped UCSB capture its fourth consecutive Big West North Division title.</p>\n<p>His breakout performance earned him the 2016 Big West Midfielder of the Year award, making him the fifth Gaucho to earn the award since 2004.</p>\n<p>In addition, Feucht was one of two juniors to be named to the All-Big West First Team, which marks his second straight selection for the honor.</p>\n<p>For Feucht, the next logical step in his career would involve winning the Big West Offensive Player of the Year, which could perhaps lead to him entering the discussion of the MAC Hermann Trophy as the nation’s player of the year.</p>\n<p>However, returning to the NCAA College Cup in his senior year would certainly be the more desired feat for one of the Big West’s elite talents.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 7 of the June 8, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78417\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78417\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-08/2017-nexus-sports-awards-under-the-radar-porter-toler-represent-wbb-along-with-mens-soccers-feucht-as-breakout-stars/","id":583,"author":{"id":45,"name":"Sean White"},"related":[582,581,580],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":12,"route":"/authors/45"}},"__N_SSG":true}
