Supporters climbed a ladder on the side of the Co-op building to see the newly installed panels on the roof. Afterward, groups celebrated by cutting a giant ribbon with a pair of scissors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Francisco-based nonprofit RE-volv started the Solar Ambassador Program as a way to help organizations and businesses switch to renewable energy. The one-year program takes college students and trains them in finance, management, crowdfunding and community engagement in a four-day retreat in Tomales Bay near San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andreas Karelas, executive director of RE-volv, said the ceremony was a way of raising awareness about renewable energy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A project like this and a ribbon-cutting like this is [sic] really meant to show all the customers that come here, all the community members, all the students in Isla Vista at Santa Barbara, that solar power works,” Karelas said. “It saves the Co-op money, it can save you money and it’s something that we could all get behind and get involved with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Solar Ambassador team started their project in 2015. After signing the lease with the Co-op in the fall, the team raised $59,261 in donations during a crowdfunding campaign in the spring of 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olivia Godfrey, a fourth-year environmental studies major and one of the solar ambassadors, said she’s happy that the project is finished.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really excited to see everything come to a close,” Godfrey said. “My favorite thing about the project was seeing the love and support that the community has for the Co-op. You don’t really see that until you tell them about something and then their face lights up, and it’s really awesome to see.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Solar Ambassador team commissioned Sun Pacific Solar Electric, a local solar contracting company, to build 100 solar panels capable of generating 24 kilowatts of energy each. The panels officially began supplying power on May 17 and have been able to generate approximately a third of the grocery store’s energy usage since then. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under a 20-year lease term, the Isla Vista Food Co-op plans to pay off the cost of its solar panels gradually over time. Representatives from RE-volv said this current plan cuts the Co-op’s electricity bill by 15-percent.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78309\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78309\" data-attachment-id=\"78309\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-05/i-v-food-co-op-takes-powerful-step-with-solar-panel-installation/dsc_0260/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1367\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_0260\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-78309\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260-1024x684.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC_0260.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-78309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Isla Vista Food Co-op installed solar panels, which now account for a third of the store’s electricity needs. <em>Yuki Copnall / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaylan Lamb, a fourth-year environmental studies major and the project leader, said the project was possible because of the cooperation among the different organizations and businesses.</span></p>\n<p>Lamb thanked the RE-volv representatives, Co-op staff and community members who supported the campaign “even when things got rocky.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[RE-volv representatives] were really our sponsors and guardians throughout the whole project and really gave us the motivation in the first place to spearhead the crowdfunding campaign to get the solar panels,” Lamb said. “The Co-op staff were so patient and so cooperative with us … It was really a group effort, and awesome to be able to bring everyone together and celebrate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the ribbon-cutting, a Co-op employee played a tune on the trumpet that was received with cheers from the crowd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Brinker, the associate director of partnership and philanthropy at RE-volv, said the ceremony was personal for her.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This ceremony has a special place in my heart because I’m from Santa Barbara.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be the fourth time Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) has introduced such a resolution. The most recent attempt occurred in 2015, when the bill </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-resolution-falls-two-votes-short-of-passing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">failed to pass</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with then-Internal Vice President Angela Lau casting the tie-breaking “no” vote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senators Jonathan Lopez and Unique Vance will first introduce the resolution; afterward, student sponsors Anumita Kaur and Edan Tessema will have a chance to speak. The public will then be able to discuss their own opinions on the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aaron Jones, the A.S. assistant director for community affairs, student engagement and advocacy, said these hearings have been widely attended by students in the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even for a spectator observing the dynamics of the room itself, [it’s] very polarizing. One half of the room has one particular position, the other half of the room has an opposing position,” Jones said. “These meetings are well attended such that they often have to be moved to Corwin Pavilion to accommodate the hundreds of people that show up.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student group Students for Justice in Palestine </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/26-student-groups-support-bds-resolution/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first released the resolution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the public on April 24. Since then, the resolution has been endorsed by 36 student organizations on campus including the Student Activist Network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed, the resolution will prompt A.S. to divest from companies such as Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard. According to the bill, these corporations have provided Israel with military aid in attacks on Gaza.</span></p>\n<p>SJP acknowledged that A.S. UCSB does not hold any investments in these companies, but they hope the bill will spur A.S. to take an active role in advocating for the UC to divest.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, eight Jewish student organizations published a joint statement opposing the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We feel for the Palestinians and Israelis, and we work actively to promote speakers and projects that help bring both sides together toward a peaceful solution,” the statement read. “We, the Jewish student leaders of UCSB, are united in rejecting this one sided, counterproductive, and incredibly hurtful BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] resolution.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of both sides hope students come out for the meeting.

Andrew Doerr, the forum moderator, then asked each candidate two questions and each candidate had thirty seconds to make a concluding statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doerr first asked the candidates to identify the most important issue affecting on-campus residents. The second question, posed by the audience, addressed resident assistant (R.A.) welfare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each prospective senator identified a set of issues that they wanted to address. Listed below are some of their goals.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ho, a first-year biology and Asian-American studies double major, said he wants to help underrepresented students feel more comfortable on campus. He said he wants to focus his efforts as a senator on food insecurity, allocating student fees for R.A. programs and increasing transparency in the senate. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neumann, a first-year global studies major, said if elected, he hopes to increase the representation of the international student community. He said he plans to work on making college more affordable and hopes to create a liaison position to strengthen the relationship between A.S. and R.A.s.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, a first-year economics and accounting major, said he is “passionate about making college more affordable for everyone.” If elected, she hopes to designate a C.A.P.S. counselor for R.A.s and personally reach out to them herself. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tejada Mir, a second-year economics and accounting major, said he wants to address tuition hikes with the state. When asked about R.A. welfare, he said “being there for them is a huge deal,” and wants residents to reach out to R.A.s to “lend them a hand … and acknowledge their presence.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yang, a first-year political science and chemistry double major, said he wants to implement rollover and guest meal swipes for the dining commons, as well as increase the number of study spaces on campus. If elected, Yang said he wants to be a liaison for R.A.s and provide a specific C.A.P.S. counselor to address their needs.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santos, a first-year political science major, said he plans to improve the mental health resources on campus. When asked about R.A. welfare, Santos said he wants to create an A.S.-funded “mental-health social” for the R.A.s.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadeghi, a first-year political science major, stated he wants to limit the amount of stress for students and increase convenience on campus through providing more water stations in the resident halls and bike lanes at the Arbor. Sadeghi said he wants to partner with C.A.P.S. to provide a program for R.A.s as well as improve the relationship between R.A.s and residents.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goldman, a first-year physics major, said he wants to increase the amount of diversity in S.T.E.M. classes. He also said the rising cost of tuition is the most important issue affecting UCSB students. If elected, he said wants to create a catered mental health group and change the drug and alcohol policy to help R.A.s become healthier leaders.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maldonado, a first-year undeclared student, said she wants to revise UCSB’s alcohol and drug program, which puts “unnecessary stress on student’s mental health.” When asked about R.A. welfare, she said she wants to increase R.A. approachability for students by changing the alcohol and drug policy for residents.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S. Elections began 8 p.m. Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of Apr. 27.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 51

Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>“We’re actually no longer doing that this year. I think that’s going to help really create a more welcoming vibe for campus,” Jayne Reimel, assistant director for the Visitor Center and Spring Insight organizer, said.</p>\n<p>According to Sgt. Rob Romero, a UCPD spokesperson, smaller Deltopia crowds and Spring Insight will contribute to the decrease in fencing. Romero said UCPD currently plans to remove all the fencing along El Colegio Road.</p>\n<p>“What we’re trying to do is scale back the police presence, scale back the fencing,” he said in an email. “We’re trying to make this a more welcoming community during that time, but still making sure that we have enough police presence there in case anything does end up getting out of hand.”</p>\n<p>Spring Insight, a day when admitted prospective students are encouraged to visit campus, typically occurs on the second week of April, and Deltopia occurs on the first weekend back from Spring Break. Coincidentally, both events will occur at the same time this year.</p>\n<p>Reimel said Spring Insight planners considered the admission decision release date and Easter holiday when scheduling the event.</p>\n<p>“We actually plan Spring Insight dates years in advance,” she said. “So we typically do them in chunks of three, four, five years at a time so this date has actually been planned for the past three years.”</p>\n<p>Because of Deltopia weekend this year, Spring Insight organizers also plan to keep prospective freshmen and families away from Isla Vista during the weekend by inviting families to eat at campus restaurants without mentioning places to eat in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Usually we tell people, ‘You can eat on campus … but you can also go to I.V. and try all these eateries,’” Reimel said. “This year we’re not doing that. We’re really trying to keep them focused on campus, amping up our programming up a little bit, trying to provide more to keep them engaged while they’re here.”</p>\n<p>Another concern of Spring Insight organizers is that Deltopia partygoers might take up parking spots on campus. Christopher Zbinden, the enforcement and guest services manager from UCSB’s Transportation &amp; Parking Services department, said although the university’s policy of “no weekend overnight visitor parking” has not changed, the department will create a way to distinguish vehicles staying for Spring Insight from those who are not.</p>\n<p>“If you’re coming into Spring Insight to register, you can actually print out a permit … there’s no cost, but it’s a way to identity those vehicles just in the event that one does stay overnight. That’ll help us best identify those people,” Zbinden said.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said he encourages the UCSB community to provide a welcoming environment for prospective freshmen regardless of Deltopia.</p>\n<p>“Through the partnership with our students, I understand that they, like all members of our campus, take pride in our community and value the reputation of where they live, learn, and work,” Yang said in an email. “These are the values that I encourage all of us to convey as we welcome our prospective students and their families to our campus during Spring Insight.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Headshots were discouraged, but not prohibited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplicity allowed several bystanders to immediately join in and participate in the game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just fun. If anyone else could come out here, be silly, hit each other with foam swords and get a pretty good workout … it’s pretty good,” Fraczek said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spanning over two hours, the warriors alternated among games of shirts versus skins, king of the hill, capture the flag and one-versus-one. Several warriors flung their arms around and slowly fell after being hit by a finishing blow, emphasizing the worthiness of their defeat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hunter McCoole, a communication major currently taking a hiatus from school, was walking her dog when she saw the warriors fighting outside her house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It looks like it was played safe. Everyone looked super stoked, and I think it’s great that everyone came outdoors and just had fun instead of being inside and studying,” McCoole said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 30 minutes of the LARP, Police Officer Andy Radujko stopped by on his motorcycle and took out his baton, jokingly ready to battle with the rest of the warriors.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radujko used to engage in a similar activity during high school and said it was great that Excursion Club was hosting the event. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75725\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75725\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-14/larpers-duel-at-dogshit-park/","id":4471,"author":{"id":99,"name":"Parry Dong"},"related":[4470,4469,4468],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/99"}},"__N_SSG":true}
