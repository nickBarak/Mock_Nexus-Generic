The California Public Employment Relations Board has already obtained “sufficient evidence” to call for a “formal complaint” against the UC, according to the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to AFSCME, previously undisclosed documents reveal that the UC, in some instances, allegedly amended contracts in secret after establishing a “contractual relationship” with vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, “UC’s initial 2016 contract with Lyon’s Security at UC Office of the President’s UCPath Center in Riverside required the vendor to pay their contractors UC’s </span><a href=\"https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/fairwage/faq.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[$15 an hour]</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> minimum wage. UC amended the contract in 2018 to exempt Lyon’s Security from this requirement,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In October 2017, </span><a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/22/workers-at-some-uc-campuses-say-they-dont-earn-fair-wages/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mercury News reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that a UC Los Angeles food service worker — who logged over 106 hours in two weeks — was paid under two names to avoid receiving overtime pay; the employee’s base pay was $10.50 an hour, nearly five dollars below the UC’s minimum wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a 2017 California State Auditor’s report that was critical of the UC’s “flawed” and “ignored” policies surrounding outsourcing and competitive bidding, the UC allegedly amended its protocols “to require all University locations to either allow existing contracts to expire after 10 years or submit them to renewed competitive bidding,” the document read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After 10 years, then, if UC wished to contract out work for more time, UC is supposed to put out a Request for Proposals (RFP), notify AFSCME and justify to the Union why it seeks to outsource the work for the additional period of time,” the document continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the complaint alleged that the university instead granted itself “exemptions” from its own amended policies and extended its existing contracts in secret. This allegedly occurred in secret “at least 28 times” from 2009-2019 at UCLA, when the university added an extra 17 “patient care technical titles” to its contract with AMN Healthcare, a healthcare management service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSMCE also alleged that the UC has spent more money on outsourcing — which has increased by “as much as 52% since 2016” — and has poached union employees’ prospects for employment, opting to instead hire lower wage non-contract workers to do the same jobs, according to a separate press release from AFSCME. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In analyses published by State Legislative committees considering reforms to University contracting practices, UC said it spent just over $345 million in 2016 to outsource jobs normally performed by AFSCME 3299 represented UC employees,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In August of 2019, UC notified state legislators that it now spends $523 million on these same services—a growth rate in outsourcing that is roughly three times larger than its direct employment growth for the same jobs,” the press release continued.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When contract renewals are on the table, AFSCME said it is the UC’s duty to first determine whether “[the contract] exists to save money solely on the basis of the contractor’s lower wages and benefits, and if so, to bring that work back in house.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of approving such contracts, AFSCME said the UC allegedly goes about filling those positions secretly, leaving contract employees in a “contingent” status, which keeps them at arm’s length from the benefits and wages of full-time employment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allegedly occurred at UC San Francisco, where 62 contracted employees working for Allied Barton, a security service, applied for “career positions” at UCSF, according to the document. Only 11 positions were filled despite many Allied Barton employees “applying to open positions two or more times,” the document read. AFSCME alleged this is a result of UCSF’s decision to keep workers retained to a contingent status.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the recent complaints and strike announcement, Andrew Gordon, spokesperson for the UC Office of the President (UCOP), said in an email that the UC finds that “AFSCME leaders have shown little flexibility on their unreasonable wage demands,” even after announcing its sixth strike since negotiations began in spring 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME leader’s contracting claims and continual strike activity are attempts to gain leverage in negotiations. UC’s agreements with AFSCME protect employees from displacement due to contracting and no employee can be terminated as a result of a sub-contracting decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In fact, the number of AFSCME-represented employees has actually increased systemwide by double digits over the past five years. The number of service workers has grown 16.8 percent, while the number of patient care workers has jumped 27.9 percent,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to UCOP’s stance, AFSCME finds that the UC’s treatment of its employees warrants a reaction that goes beyond the bargaining table — “the picket lines.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is so troubling about UC’s continuing illegal conduct is that it’s becoming even more prevalent,” Kathryn Lybarger, AFSCME president, said. “These complaints detail UC’s continuing systematic and often secretive efforts to replace its own employees with lower wage contractors.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

[The] day of, we all showed up, we were all ready … But the only thing is not a lot of kids showed up,” Ornelas said. “Three kids showed up, which is really unfortunate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tradition of trick-or-treating is often lost on those residing in Isla Vista, especially for the local youth in search of bite-sized fun. Events like Haunt the Loop help provide an opportunity to engage in a community often tailored to a much different demographic. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/islavistacdpcalifornia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">last census</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2010, less than three percent of Isla Vista’s 23,096 residents were under the age of 18; within that, less than 0.9 percent were under the age of three. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like the children around this area don’t really have a normal childhood as other children would have, because they live in a college town,” Joana Gutierrez, a third-year sociology major who volunteered at Haunt the Loop, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They’re constricted of doing many things, especially during the holidays, because it’s not really safe for them to go out when everybody is going out and getting drunk and partying. So I feel like it’s very important that [we] as students take them out to safely trick-or-treat and show them that we care about them having a childhood.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But only a few volunteers got to answer this call. Trick-or-treating was supposed to be over a two hour period from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. last Sunday, with volunteers leading groups of children from one spot to another. The first </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and only </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> group to arrive came to the Pardall Center around 3:30 p.m. But around 4 p.m., Ornelas said the volunteer crew began packing up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s drop in numbers took organizers by surprise. Both the planning and the event itself were based entirely off of last year’s report, according to Shannon Sweeney, the EVPLA chief of staff, who put the event together alongside Andy Ruiz, the EVPLA community events coordinator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can never really guess predictability on the kids’ end, just because every year it’s different </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> what they might be doing that weekend,” Ruiz said. “The businesses are always so amazing at helping out with that, being very cooperative, allowing us to invite people into their business for community betterment.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two worked from a report left by former Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) organizer Alex Young, who detailed the process in which organizers hosted the event last year. Like last year, according to Ornelas, the I.V. CSD coordinated with the EVPLA office to advertise the event with posters through I.V. Youth Projects (IVYP) and I.V. Elementary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The youth-oriented nature of the event proved to be one of the biggest challenges in planning and publicizing it, Sweeney said. While most events targeted for students are advertised through Facebook and Instagram, Haunt the Loop’s audience </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">children and their parents </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">required a different kind of grassroots approach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tackle that, the EVPLA staff brought their posters to the I.V. CSD, who then shared it with IVYP’s Family Resource Center. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said the planning process was “exactly the same as last year,” and couldn’t deduce why the turnout was significantly lower compared to Haunt the Loop in years past.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It could have been any number of things … sometimes events just don’t have a lot of people come to them. It was a great success last year; it was a lot of people. Who knows why people didn’t come this year?” Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fifteen local businesses in and around the Loop </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">including Buddha Bowls, Rockfire Grill, Cajé, Amazon and the I.V. Bicycle Boutique </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">partnered with the EVPLA office to pitch in with candy distribution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers were on hand to provide candy to participating businesses, but Ornelas said many provided their own and decorated for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With plenty of leftover candy to spare, Ornelas also is not sure what caused this year’s small turnout. Hosting the event on Sunday afternoon </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the same day as last year’s Haunt the Loop </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> likely isn’t the problem, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruiz said the Sunday afternoon slot was chosen for safety concerns for children and for volunteers who would be difficult to schedule during the week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with this year’s low attendance in mind, Ornelas is discussing with Sweeney and Ruiz about moving the event closer to Halloween in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas speculates that the areas to the north of I.V. are a more popular option for candy collecting as “a lot of children go trick-or-treating in the community behind FT” and as it is outside of I.V., which may be safer and more receptive to children. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of working through I.V. CSD and other organizations, Ornelas believes that in the future, the EVPLA office should be more direct in its outreach by keeping more of the workload in-house to draw the most outreach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s Haunt the Loop was a learning experience, Ornelas said, in part because the responsibility of hosting the event fell onto new shoulders, and the small showing left most involved scratching their heads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the fliers, pounds of candy and weeks of preparation, when an event doesn’t turn out the way you had it envisioned, Ornelas said: “It just sucks.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the Oct. 31, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

of the External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA), which is led by executive Christian Ornelas; alongside a panel featuring a number of prominent local officials, several campus organizations tabled to advertise the local resources available for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the main portion of the town hall, students directed questions about basic needs — which encompass housing, food insecurity and money — to a panel of five members: Monique Limón, an assembly member representing Santa Barbara and Ventura; Salud Carbajal, a representative for Santa Barbara; Joan Hartmann, Santa Barbara county district supervisor; Margaret Klawunn, vice chancellor for student affairs and Mike Miller, vice chancellor for enrollment services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) General Manager Jonathan Abboud and Board Director Jay Freeman were in the audience, but there was no representation from I.V.’s local government on stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas said his office did not initially plan to host a town hall this year — until a policy proposal from the Free SB campaign earlier this summer changed that. Following conversations with fellow Associated Students (A.S.) executives and input from Hartmann, Ornelas said his office got to work on the town hall event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town hall kicked off with brief introductions from each panelist and a description of the work they do at their respective levels to help alleviate the insecurities that are often associated with basic needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a political standpoint, Hartmann, Carbajal and Limón all stressed the importance of food assistance programs such as the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and its California branch, CalFresh, which aim to shed weight from the insecurities of food affordability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you have qualified for [SNAP and CalFresh], the benefits [can be] used at a grocery store, the food co-op, the farmer’s market and the food pantry,” Hartmann added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the university side, Klawunn and Miller highlighted various programs and resources UCSB offers to students in need. Voucher programs, which support housing and meals, for example, can be used by students during times of crisis to help get them through their next meal or next month’s rent, according to Miller, who chairs the Food Security &amp; Basic Needs Task Force at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What we’re trying to do is get as much direct aid to students as we can around food and around housing,” Klawunn added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the panelists’ introductions, students lined up behind the microphone to speak directly to the panel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first question asked to the panel was about the responsibility of the government to support basic needs and its efforts to carry those responsibilities out.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every five years, the government passes what is called the Farm Bill. And a good, significant funding of the farm bill is the SNAP program … it’s absolutely imperative that we look out for those who are most vulnerable amongst us and that we work together to provide a safety net,” Carbajal said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conversation then turned to housing when an audience member asked about affordable housing for campus workers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn responded by talking about the proposed construction of additional housing on Ocean Road, where units would be offered for rent at more affordable prices, despite the “staggering” cost of living in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limón, a member of the Housing and Community Development committee at the State Assembly who said she has voted in favor of “167 different bills to advance housing,” believes there is no one solution to remediating the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Housing for “workers, for students, for staff, for anyone — it is a greater conversation and the state has really tried to make some investments,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As questions came in, one student asked the panel how Black students — one of the most underrepresented demographics at UCSB — would be supported through basic needs initiatives and remain “secure” in interactions with university law enforcement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann responded with an acknowledgement that “people of color have it much worse” in the context of basic needs. She moved on to highlight local law enforcement’s transparent approaches through new initiatives such as the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/foot-patrol-to-launch-restorative-justice-program-offering-alternative-punishment-for-ordinance-violators/#search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Foot Patrol Restorative Justice Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Party Registration Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Klawunn added that the UC Police Department’s new chief of police, James Brock, is taking a different approach to law enforcement by consulting students to “hear their voices” and better embed the police department in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a question directed to Miller, one student asked what the university can do better to spread awareness for resources offered on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller acknowledged that spreading awareness for campus resources is the university’s “number one problem” in the context of basic needs. He noted that many initiatives, such as the </span><a href=\"https://hacsb.org/section-8/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Housing Voucher program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have been difficult to advertise to students because the programs were recently created. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat this, he noted that the university works with student interns to spread awareness to the rest of the student body on a grassroots level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the town hall drew to a close, one final question regarding the role of citizenship in eligibility for resources was brought to the panel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limón cited Assembly Bill 540, an 18-year-old piece of legislation that “allowed high school students who graduated in California to enroll [in college in California] with in-state tuition.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a different </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB540\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 540</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom this October, undocumented students will now have the opportunity to be eligible for certain grants and programs beginning next academic year, according to Limón.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, through UCSB’s incoming “meal plan scholarship,” Miller said the university is trying to establish “parallel programs” to CalFresh and SNAP by offering a campus alternative for undocumented students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to make sure undocumented students are on a level playing field,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Carbajal took his turn to respond, he said that documentation and citizenship should not come before helping others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We don’t want to live in a country where we look at each other and not think of our humanity,” he said, drawing the town hall to a close. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no tangible change that came directly from the town hall in regard to helping students with their basic needs, although politicians and university administrators were presented with a clearer picture of what problems are affecting students the most.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas isn’t entirely sure what his office plans to do following the town hall but is actively “thinking of ways to move forward.” He intends to hand over his office’s work on basic needs to the A.S. Lobby Corps co-chairs who “will be able to give a lot more time and focus to a basic needs campaign.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Leyva, who authored the bill, said in a </span><a href=\"https://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-10-04-bill-ensuring-timely-pay-uc-workers-approved-governor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effective Jan. 1, 2020, the bill mandates that the UC pay its nearly 140,000 employees on their regularly scheduled payday, or be paid in accordance with university policy if paid on a more frequent basis, according to Tom Hintze, a graduate student at UC Davis and member of UAW 2865.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite payment complications resulting from UCPath issues in the past, the UC never faced any wage theft penalties because it is a public sector institution, which doesn’t require employers to pay fines for each payroll violation, Hintze said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees under the umbrella of UCPath looking to file a claim with the payroll system were often forced to wait an unknown sum of weeks, and in some cases, months, to get their paycheck, Hintze said. SB 698, however, allots a five-day period for the payroll system to pay employees in full. Otherwise, employers will be subject to legal action through the Private Attorneys General Act, which enables workers to sue “in order to recoup their wages.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara first implemented UCPath in Fall Quarter 2018, but experienced shortfalls similar to other universities in the UC system when the UC Student Association released a list of demands to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/ucsa-releases-demands-to-uc-regarding-ucpath-implementation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide restitution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for student workers affected by the payroll system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hintze said he began working for UAW 2865 in spring 2018 but didn’t take notice of UCPath’s “major problems” until May of 2018, when the payroll system was implemented at UC Merced and UC Riverside. Six months later, UCPath migrated to UCSB and UC Los Angeles, where there was “somewhere near a thousand people” who either weren’t paid on time, weren’t paid the right amount or lost benefits in the process, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students, especially those who often rely on a consistent pay schedule, have been bruised by UCPath’s inconsistent pay periods. In one instance at UCSB, an employee had their car repossessed as a result of “not being paid on time,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Berkeley, three employees were greeted with eviction notices after missing two months’ worth of pay due to the payroll system’s inability to accommodate for a shift in pay periods, according to Hintze. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath is expected to continue rolling out through 2020 at other universities such as UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis. Hintze stressed the timeliness of SB 698, which he hopes will help prevent a “major disaster like last year” when payroll issues arose from UCPath’s integration at other universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath’s migration across the UC system also marks a shift in payroll infrastructure. Hintze acknowledged that payroll problems predated UCPath’s arrival but said they were significantly easier to dispute because those former payroll centers were the respective campuses. Now, the UC has shifted the entire payroll system solely to UC Riverside, but the checks themselves don’t come from there; instead, according to Hintze, checks are “cut” and distributed from out of state, making it even harder to navigate the payroll process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While SB 698 will not repair any payroll damage incurred before it became law, Hintze said the UAW was successful in settling with the university to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compensate every employee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> affected by UCPath’s payroll errors last February. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Each worker who was affected was eligible for $150 for each paycheck that [UCPath] had affected. So, the university paid out over $162,000 to student workers in damages,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

page </span></em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What most students don’t know, however, is that this post didn’t belong to a student at all — it belonged to a professor, seasoned with over a decade’s worth of experience in the art of memeing with enough practice to likely earn himself a degree in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The professor, Bob Kennedy — a linguistics lecturer at UCSB — first dipped his toes in the university’s meme scene years ago, when he began posting on a now-defunct Facebook group.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think your cohort is not aware of the fact that there was a different UCSB meme page around 2011, 2012 or so. It’s still up, but it’s fallen into disuse and nobody posts on it,” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I stopped checking because there was no activity on it. But then I think it was during Thomas Fire, one of my students mentioned to me, ‘Hey, Professor Kennedy, you’ve got to check out the [new] meme page because the memes people are making about the fire are hysterical,’” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to jokes of his own, Kennedy blends in well with the student-generated memes around him, posting pictures of slumped-over trees and punny captions to appease viewers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until recently, Kennedy says most of his activity on the “Zesty Meme Cuisine for Horny Teens” meme page has been spent “lurking,” or scrolling through the page without posting. But he actively posts on a linguistics meme page he maintains himself, which he said is chock-full of “really niche humor.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those [linguistics] jokes are lost on just about everybody,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Kennedy said the jokes that don’t work serve to teach him about the ones that do. After teaching at UCSB for over 15 years, Kennedy has had ample time to hone his craft. He’ll opt to inject “a little bit of playful humor” while teaching a class, which oftentimes helps him make a point or lighten the mood. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If I have humor in class, it’s either self-deprecating or it makes fun of people in power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But memes, on the other hand, serve a different purpose. Kennedy finds that the nature of memes — “a quick joke” — enables people to laugh at “content that everyone can get right away.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it doesn’t need to be explained, then people are gonna respond well,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s not to forget about the downsides of meme culture, such as the potential for a “destructive” or “nasty” message — which Kennedy said is generally the result of cracking a joke intended to be funny but ends up offensive in its delivery. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Another thing that comes up, especially in the teaching context, is where we confront humor that’s hurtful. And so in some of my classes, I do this: I’ll say, ‘Look, here’s the point of view that someone had tried to make with a joke and it’s offensive and their defense is going to be, ‘Well, come on, I’m just trying to be funny,’” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s never an appropriate response to defend a joke that’s been hurtful to someone else,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid this, however, Kennedy suggests that anyone looking to crack a joke should bear in mind their own identity as to not “punch down” with their humor, or make a joke that pushes the boundaries on one’s identity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kennedy defines himself as a “straight, white middle-aged person,” which means “the only people I can tell jokes about are people who think they’re smarter than they are, people who are wealthy or people who are older than myself,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He made note of comedy’s magnitude in the academic world, some of which has spilled into classrooms at UCSB with Linguistics 135, a course dedicated to memes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have a colleague in my department who teaches a class on memes and it’s a deep dive into theories of what it is that people are tapping into when they make [memes],” Kennedy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s scholars who study the structure of humor and joke templates and everything else like that. And the nature of how humor plays a role in conversational interactions,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a linguist by trade, Kennedy said he uses comedy to not only make students laugh, but to also use memes’ shared “overlapping” sense of humor to better understand social practices used among college students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The student perspective] is valuable to me,” which opens doors to a culture that “people my age ought to be more aware of than pretend like we’re annoyed by it or anything else like that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So next time a funny meme floats across your screen — look twice — it may be your professor. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The two are currently in contact with the UCSB American Indian Student Association to “get their input on the situation” and “[see] what exactly my office can do to help them,” Beasley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the backlash against TMT, Beasley maintains that the project will go on “with or without Chancellor Yang’s involvement,” but has hope in the power of student activism and its potential to stunt the UC’s role in the project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The main solution would just be to come together and to really listen to the indigenous communities here and over in Hawaii,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s beauty in activism and students using their voices because it gets things done.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada could not be immediately reached for comment.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Students gather to read papers published in the blockchain field, host invited speakers, attend student-produced lectures and travel to blockchain-related conferences, according to Piergiacomo Palmisani, the club’s incoming president and a graduate student in the Technology Management Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of people that are interested in learning but are not willing to learn [everything] by themselves. That’s why Blockchain at UCSB exists. We can provide a quality education by teaching [students] all the essentials of this technology,” Palmisani said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a passion for technology is common among all members, reasons for joining the club vary. Some see it as a place where students “can potentially meet their new employers” while others have project ideas and aspirations that could be funded through connections made in the club, Palmisani said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one instance, Palmisani said Blockchain at UCSB connected a project called Reward Stream, designed by third-year computer science major Max Colbert, to investors. Colbert went on to receive $50,000 for the startup after Blockchain at UCSB helped put his project on the map. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one aspect of blockchain that the club will not support, Palmisani said, is cryptocurrency trading itself. The instant gratification and “quick return” of digital currency is alluring to many, he said, but students in search of investment advice will not find it here.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, the club is focused mainly on “legitimizing” blockchain’s other uses — supply chains, data sharing and property ownership — by drawing more recognition to the industry in hopes of spurring accredited classes down the line, according to Cameron Dennis ‘18, co-founder of Blockchain at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By establishing accredited classes in universities, blockchain may reach those who never knew they had an interest in the technology, Dennis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In doing so, the “talent pipeline” for blockchain professions would have more room to grow, providing employment opportunities at Fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Oracle, which are already investing in the technology, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dennis and Palmisani see the blockchain community as a halfway mark between a club and a classroom, thus bridging the gap between the two.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paramount to Blockchain at UCSB’s achievements is its success in establishing an accredited class dedicated to the technology, Dennis said. This coming fall, the College of Creative Studies will be offering a class about “blockchain development” which students can take for credit — a first at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This class is fulfilling the original mission of what we’re trying to do,” Dennis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB will also be receiving support for blockchain-related endeavors through a new initiative launched by a venture capital-backed investment firm called MouseBelt. In August, MouseBelt University, a branch of the firm dedicated to investing in higher education, announced its plans to support UCSB, UC Los Angeles and UC Davis through an “accelerator program,” which entails two planned $500,000 investments for student projects and research funding to be </span><a href=\"https://www.mousebelt.com/blog/mousebelt-university-launches-education-initiative-across-three-uc-campuses/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">split among the three schools</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ashlie Meredith, university program developer at MouseBelt, UCSB will additionally be receiving a donation to the engineering department and the potential for student project funding in exchange for equity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meredith said UCSB was one of 13 universities that MouseBelt initially worked with on student projects in the past, which made finding a home for the accelerator program easier because the club’s success was already on MouseBelt’s radar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I engaged in an exploratory effort to talk to as many student organizations as I could in the U.S. and Canada to get the temperature of blockchain at universities, what was going on, who had classes and how established these clubs were,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Blockchain at UCSB] had a lot of partnerships with other organizations, even in Mexico with Blockchain UNAM. They’ve had multiple companies incubate and bring their ideas for potential funding. Even one of our portfolio companies came from one of those investments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Dennis and Palmisani are both encouraged by MouseBelt’s interest in supporting blockchain-related endeavors at UCSB, and specifically the prospect of student entrepreneurs earning funding, they said there is still work to be done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palmisani finds that more universities nationwide need to be supportive of an atmosphere where the prospect of educating students about blockchain can become a reality. While investments from venture capital companies are a good sign for UCSB, those opportunities aren’t extended to every school, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does work, Dennis said, is teaching students in a “grassroots” style. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I go to conferences and I understand what’s happening because I listen to these lectures or presentations. When I’m at a conference, I’ll summarize all the points that seem most important and give a presentation on those points,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking home what he learned from conferences, Dennis said he enabled students to keep up with current developments in the professional sphere by teaching them what he learned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, Palmisani said he is looking forward to the upcoming year working with Blockchain at UCSB. Already included on the list of speakers the club will be bringing to campus is Julian Wheatland, former Chief Operating Officer of Cambridge Analytica, which was </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/amp-stories/cambridge-analytica-explainer/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">embroiled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in scandal in early 2018 after millions of users’ information was harvested without consent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With invited speakers, conventions, hackathons and lectures, Palmisani said he embraces the work that needs to be done, despite the heavy load. But it wouldn’t be possible without an affinity for blockchain, his driving force for running the club.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You’ve got to have a lot of passion, otherwise I wouldn’t be doing this. I would just play soccer — my other passion — but I’m not as good as a professional player,” he said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three months before he was set to be a free man, the idea of life on the outside had Ryan Flaco Rising up to his neck in stress. After losing nearly half his life to the prison system, his outlook felt bleak — except for his hopes of going to college. He already had nearly a year’s worth of credits thanks to a newfound passion for learning he discovered while in prison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising — now two months into his time at UC Santa Barbara as a third-year comparative literature and interdisciplinary major — heard about a program called Berkeley Underground Scholars (BUS) shortly before his release, which helps formerly incarcerated individuals attain college degrees. Eager to learn more, he called Danny Murillo, co-founder of BUS, off of a contraband cell phone, who assured him there was hope after prison through education. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89857\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89857\" data-attachment-id=\"89857\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-20/formerly-incarcerated-student-wants-to-make-a-blueprint-for-others-to-pursue-higher-education/dsc_3294/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?fit=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1363\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"DSC_3294\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89857\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DSC_3294.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-89857\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Rising, it’s the prospect of leaving a legacy for his children that motivates him to continue helping formerly incarcerated students. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon release from prison, Rising became houseless, but BUS had not forgotten about him. Members of BUS flew to meet Rising in San Diego, where he was living after prison, to convince him to enroll in San Diego Community College and start his own chapter of Underground Scholars there, but multiple hurdles sent Rising on a detour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising curbed his drug use after taking a class in prison on the pharmacology of drug abuse, but he was still admitted to rehab after leaving prison. He soon left, walking away from an offer to work at the facility so that he could go to school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But upon arrival, Rising instantly felt out of place. While in class, the insecurities of his “tatted up” appearance and his age — a decade older than most — spiraled him into dejection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to quit. I didn’t feel like I belonged. So I called Martin [Vela-Sanchez] up at Berkeley Underground Scholars and he goes ‘Flaco, just do 90 days [at the college]. Do 90 days and shake as many hands as you can and you’re going to see that people were there that went through the same exact thing you did,’” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Three years later, I’m getting my associate’s degree, the first person in my whole entire family to get an associate’s degree, to get any college degree at that.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While in community college, Rising learned to embrace his differences and founded the Urban Scholars Union, a support group for formerly incarcerated students. But two years wasn’t much time, Rising said, and following graduation, he was looking to establish something bigger: “I beat prison and I used school as a platform to end the cycle of recidivism, I found a way out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an associate’s degree under his belt, Rising began scouting universities to continue his education. He had applied to four UC schools — UC Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley — along with the University of San Diego and was accepted to all of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After visiting UCSB, Rising was sold — in part, he said, because there was no Underground Scholars program here. He felt a calling to carve out a program from scratch, despite everyone at UC Berkeley that was “waiting for [him].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Berkeley has Berkeley Underground Scholars, UC Irvine has UC Irvine Underground Scholars, UCLA has UCLA Underground Scholars, UC Santa Barbara has nothing and neither did USD,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He hopes to make his own mark on the campus with the creation of such a program, one that would be the first of its kind at UCSB. Operating like most others within the UC system, UCSB Underground Scholars will support students released from prison in an effort to guide them through their educational experience and walk away with a degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been trained by my mentors — the other students who have come before me — who paved the way so there’s a blueprint that can be implemented to actually help other formerly incarcerated individuals,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I came [to UCSB] with this blueprint in hand, like ‘Hey look, there’s a bunch of formerly incarcerated students that are going to get out with their associate’s degrees and they’re going to have their 60 units credits and they’re going to be wanting to come here.’ What are we going to do to prepare to receive them?”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising said he is currently working with the Office of Admissions, the Educational Opportunity Program, the Transfer Student Initiative, Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead and other Underground Scholar programs, in addition to seeking out a space on campus to house the initiative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although still in its early stages, Rising already sees the potential of having a space for formerly incarcerated students on campus. By extending a hand to someone who could use help in school, like Rising himself, he said the initiative is a way to break the tumultuous cycle of the prison system, where many individuals often end up back behind bars because they never had the opportunity to pursue higher education.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“From correctional facilities to college, we’re focused on helping people come back out and re-enter through the college system because we’re set up from the gate, we’re set up to fail by probation and parole,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got all these stipulations that are thrown on us. They put us in these re-entry homes that are in the ghettos with drug dealers and drugs around them. And they know that we’re gonna fail and they know that we’re gonna recidivate right back in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising embraces his past, not only to use it as fuel for his ambitions, but also to show people like him that a life outside of prison is completely possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m promoting college and I dub it as being a ‘gangsta nerd.’ I’m still that gang member. I still represent East LA, but I represent it in a new way,” he said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Rising, two million incarcerated individuals in America is too high of a number for the country “that celebrates freedom the most.” His solution extends beyond UCSB, where he hopes to see more unity in communities that are hurt the most by crime and incarceration. Oftentimes, he said, it’s the absence of a legacy to aspire to that sends people to prison. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Rising, it’s the prospect of leaving a legacy for his children that motivates him to continue helping formerly incarcerated students as an advocate for education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My children have been through a lot, their dad hasn’t always been there, I’ve been incarcerated,” Rising said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But now, my daughter wants to go to college,” Rising said. “My son, he wants to be an author.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m building a legacy for them to follow.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

the suit is Southern California (SoCal) Edison, an electrical services company; Frontier Communications, a telecommunications company; and Utility Tree Service (UTS), a tree trimming company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to court documents, SoCal Edison entered into a “special use permit” (SUP) agreement with the federal government, agreeing to maintain land owned by the government by trimming branches and removing trees to prevent dangerous tree collapses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To carry out the agreement, the court complaint said SoCal Edison paid a tree trimming service, Utility Tree Service, to take care of its green space. UTS specializes in “utility line clearance work” and provides services such as vegetation management and storm and emergency response, </span><a href=\"http://www.utilitytreeservice.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to the company’s website. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to the court complaint, UTS inspected a faulty tree but allegedly made no effort to clear the hazard. The tree later collapsed on power and communication lines, belonging to SoCal Edison and Frontier Communications respectively, and ignited adjacent vegetation, the court complaint alleged. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The complaint also claims that Frontier Communications improperly maintained vegetation adjacent to its communication lines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brush fire soon manifested into a forest fire, engulfing an area with a length equal to the distance from </span><a href=\"https://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedImages/countyofsb/Content/Emergencies/reyMap08-30-16.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2138648331\" data-slb-group=\"89672\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista to Montecito.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among others, alleged damages to the land include “the mitigation, rehabilitation, and reforestation of burned areas; loss of and damage to timber, habitat, wildlife, watershed and earth protection… environmental damage… soil damage and erosion,” according to the court complaint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the SUP signed by SoCal Edison, the electrical company is mandated to compensate the National Forest Service for any damages incurred on the land, the court complaint alleged. After almost a month, the fire was extinguished but resulted in “suppression costs and rehabilitation costs in excess of $26 million,” the court complaint read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Aug. 17, the day the court complaint was filed, SoCal Edison allegedly had not paid “any part of the sum demanded by the United States” — an amount which was not disclosed in the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SoCal Edison, Frontier Communications and UTS did not respond to requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November 2018, SoCal Edison </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-02/southern-california-edison-admits-to-being-a-source-of-the-thomas-fire/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">admitted to being one of the sources of the Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which swept through Ventura and Santa Barbara County between December 2017 and January 2018 and ultimately burned over 281,893 acres of land.

called for an increase in pay and employee benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming weeks, UPTE will have the opportunity to formally ratify both contracts, focusing on employee compensation, health benefits and retirement benefits, according to a </span><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the agreement, Peter Chester, executive director of labor relations for the UC, said the UC is “pleased” with the new agreements which will grant employees “competitive pay” and “excellent benefits.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the press release, the tentative agreements entail a 20% “across the board” increase in pay for health care professionals, and a 22% increase in pay for research and technical professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of retirement benefits, the press release states that new UC employees will be eligible for “the same pension benefits as current UPTE-represented employees” until 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health care, research and technical professionals will also benefit from no retirement cuts, no “dangerous” pension drop out, overtime for over eight hours and double overtime after twelve hours, according to the </span><a href=\"http://www.upte.org/local/new/congrats-ta/\"><span

patents. </span><em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seth Levy, one of the lawyers representing UCSB, said the major retailers did not take the proper steps to ensure that UCSB received compensation from the sales of the popular light bulbs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, Levy said UCSB is seeking an undisclosed amount of unpaid royalties as well as licensing agreements with the retailers. As many as 28 different types of light bulbs sold at the five major retailers allegedly contain patented technology, according to the court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suit alleges that from 2010 to 2019, researchers at UCSB’s Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Center (SSLEEC) patented a series of four innovations that allowed LED lights to mimic the orange glow of Thomas Edison’s clear incandescent light bulbs without toxic filaments and at a fraction of the cost, according to court documents obtained from Levy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documents, all of which are duplicates save for minor changes, credit three full-time UCSB professors with inventing the patents: James “Jim” Speck, Steven DenBaars and Shuji Nakamura, who was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All are materials professors within the College of Engineering. DenBaars is also an electrical and computer engineering professor, while Nakamura is the solid state lighting and energy center co-director. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nakamura did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the alleged patent infringements.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joseph “Joe” Incandela, vice chancellor for research at UCSB, said in a statement to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that the unpaid royalties from the retailers in the lawsuit can be put back into “future research, education, and the development of new technologies.” Incandela is also a physics professor at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope that the action taken by UC Santa Barbara will underline the importance of respecting the rights of university patent owners,” Incandela said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Court complaints note that “substantially all” light fixtures allegedly produced using UCSB’s filament technology are manufactured in China. Target and Walmart had knowledge of patented technology on their shelves as early as December 2017, according to court complaints, when the two stores were sent a “notice of infringement” from the university.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The strategy has been to reach out directly to the retailers because the products are primarily made overseas, which makes it impractical and difficult for UC to pursue infringement,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, UCSB made efforts to form licensing agreements with retailers outside of court, Levy said, but was stiff-armed by retailers after unsuccessful attempts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Businesses, particularly certain industry sectors like these sorts of consumer products, tend to either ignore or just discount any outreach they have from a university about their need for a license,” Levy said. “They don’t think a university is actually going to enforce those patents, so they just ignore it and carry that risk.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, in 2019, five years after patented products allegedly began saturating the market, UCSB is seeking litigation. The university was hesitant to sue, Levy said: “Litigation, especially of this scale, is a last resort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levy noted that UCSB’s Office of Technology and Industry Alliances made “a lot of efforts to have business conversations with appropriate entities in the lighting industry,” but said they had no luck, and litigation became “necessary.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instances when universities seek legal action over patent rights are rare, Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Until this case, there really are very few examples of universities directly enforcing their patent rights against industry,” Levy said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s decision to seek litigation comes on the backdrop of a much larger issue in which the threat of stolen knowledge is constantly looming, he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a systemic problem … It’s important for academic institutions to have tools like this available to them to make sure their rights are respected.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB is successful in court, the money would be split three ways between Longford Capital — a litigation firm working with the university — SSLEEC researchers responsible for the patents and UCSB itself, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-30/uc-santa-barbara-sues-led-lightbulbs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomberg reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

David Ige gave the project’s construction a green light, leading </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/20/hawaii-mauna-kea-thirty-meter-telescope\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">local residents to block access to the construction site. </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The protest is ongoing and has resulted in </span><a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/07/17/breaking-news/thirty-meter-telescope-protesters-brace-for-arrests-at-mauna-kea/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dozens of arrests.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it was only in the last week, following national attention surrounding the protests, that UCSB students discovered Yang is the chair of TMT’s board of governors, a position he has held since 2007, and that the UC </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/science/hawaii-telescope-tmt-mauna-kea.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pledged $300 million to build the telescope</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Sv9fA0QsPFuu-HgZeHaV7BzFYoHYPhmR1sKUz5CmoaY/edit?fbclid=IwAR0AMFF85XTJ1d2A0p5xH9NBzhCbjSLNcm5gvwtG6GMVYT0B1mboKUi3nNA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One open letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> circulating the UCSB community, created by fourth-year theater and anthropology double major Ivana Cruz, calls for Yang’s resignation from the chair of the board of governors, a formal apology to those “affected by the construction of the TMT” and a statement in support of Mauna Kea’s preservation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Sunday night, Cruz said the open letter has over 120 responses from students at schools around the world: UCLA, Stanford, Boston City College and the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter states that “[TMT] is based on the fundamental belief that projects conducted by institutions should come before the willing consent of the people whose land is to be governed, even when these institutions have no connection to the land.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will not back down from these demands nor will we accept any opportunities for dialogue that present the issue as one where all players have an equal voice and which can be solved by anything but the official and permanent discontinuation of the project,” the open letter read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cruz declined to comment further, stating she did not want to speak on behalf of Native Hawaiians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter also asks signers to list the location and time of any public appearances Yang may be making in the near future that they know of, so event organizers “can be contacted and pressured into canceling his appearances until he adheres to the demands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ciara Thrower, a third-year environmental studies and political science double major, started another </span><a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/community_petitions/The_students_of_the_University_of_California_Stop_Chancellor_Yang_and_UC_involvement_in_building_the_TMT_on_Mauna_Kea/?oMOXKob&amp;utm_source=sharetools&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=petition-760812-Stop_Chancellor_Yang_and_UC_involvement_in_building_the_TMT_on_Mauna_Kea&amp;utm_term=MOXKob%2Ben\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Thursday asking Yang and the UC to withdraw involvement from the construction of the telescope.

She added that native lands should be prioritized above the scientific project, despite the advantages that might come with putting the telescope at Mauna Kea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do realize that the volcano is supposedly the best place for astronomy, but I think the native homeland is more important than [being] the best place they could build it.

Food Security Committee, said the Free SB campaign set its sights specifically on the cultivation tax because of its “reliability”; due to the recency of legalized marijuana, Moon said, the tax is unlikely to go anywhere for some time, which the campaign flagged as a good marker for consistent funds.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cultivation tax first arrived in California in January 2018, when the state deemed that “harvested cannabis is subject to a cultivation tax … [and] applies to all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market,” according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/l519.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA.)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax, according to the CDTFA, is set at $9.25 per dry-weight ounce of marijuana flower and $2.75 per dry-weight of marijuana leaves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marijuana is also a popular product among local growers — over “a third of all cultivation licenses issued in California to date are held in Santa Barbara County,” according to a </span><a href=\"https://sd19.senate.ca.gov/news/2019-06-24-jackson-issues-statement-cannabis-trailer-bill-vote\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents Santa Barbara County. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the </span><a href=\"https://santamariatimes.com/news/local/santa-barbara-county-cannabis-tax-revenues-yet-to-materialize/article_13df5cb0-6165-506a-aee4-6787a650a187.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Maria Times reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Santa Barbara County could earn between $4 and $64 million in tax revenue per year. According to quarterly reports from the CDTFA, however, the entire state yielded only $35 million in cultivation tax revenue in 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, Steel said the state is using the cultivation tax for administrative purposes, namely to “hire people to process the applications for [marijuana] growers and to make sure that legal growers are abiding [by] codes and to shut down illegal growing operations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to change where the money goes, Steel said, is to start locally. Aside from engaging with UCSB student leaders about the tax, Steel said he is also focused on “trying to get our student body aware of the situation.” He hopes to rally enough student support so that local lawmakers will consider amending the tax to grant the campaign access to the revenue stream. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The [Santa Barbara County Board of] supervisors are revisiting [how the cultivation tax can be used]. If we’re able to show large community support behind it, I think we will bring the issue to the forefront of the supervisors’ attention,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steel also acknowledged that UCSB students are not unique to facing financial insecurities. He described the situation as a “county issue,” noting that students at several other universities in the area — such as Hancock College and Santa Barbara City College — face similar economic hardships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Moon said he could help support the initiative by “writ[ing] up a resolution in support of this campaign” within the A.S. Senate next year and by reaching out to various campus organizations to further bolster the campaign.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, both Moon and Steel said the campaign’s foremost goal is to garner support at the July 9 Board of Supervisors meeting in Santa Maria. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re really trying to build from the ground up a coalition of grassroots movements. We’re [aiming] to make those who could affect change, like the board supervisors, aware of the needs and concerns of the tens of thousands of students in the county,” Moon said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Salcedo pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Berkeley, the father of a Berkeley alumunus was charged with </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2019/03/13/father-of-uc-berkeley-alumnus-charged-in-college-admission-scandal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allegedly paying a test-taker</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to take his son’s SAT test to help him gain admission to the university, as reported by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Cal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The father pled not guilty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were no reported instances of backdoor admissions at UC Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June’s audit is the first of two system-wide ECAS investigations into the UC admissions process; the second will be completed by the end of 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit report made note of three specific suggestions to strengthen the UC application process: clearer documentation, improved verification protocols and stronger admissions procedures.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure clear documentation, the audit suggests maintaining a “clear documentation trail” in order for admissions personnel to arrive at accurate admission decisions. The audit also calls for additional documentation for students applying on the basis of athletics or “special talent.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the audit calls for a surveillance of donations and philanthropy to avoid admissions decisions “being made on the basis of expected financial gain to the university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure an applicant’s truthfulness, the audit suggests the UC bolster its current vetting techniques to make it more difficult for third parties to frame an applicant’s “special talents” to gain an upper hand in the admissions process. Furthermore, the audit noted a lack of accountability in monitoring a student athlete’s engagement in their respective sport. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of strengthening procedures, the audit reported a lack of processes in place to manage conflicts of interest in the admissions process and the “reporting structure” of athletics compliance offices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audit suggests an improvement of these processes to “prevent bad actors from taking advantage of the system in the future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano said in a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/current-issues/admissions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that while the UC believes its UC admissions process “works well and has significant and effective controls in place,” the UC “accept[s] all of the ECAS recommendations so we can continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We take our zero tolerance policy extremely seriously — even one instance of admissions fraud is one too many,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano also implored each UC chancellor to develop their own “campus-specific” plans and tailor them to the ECAS’ recommendations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Chancellor Henry Yang did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding a specific plan for the UCSB campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of May, the California State Assembly took initial legislative steps towards improving university admissions processes with </span><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1383\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AB 1383</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which would deny any university within the UC system the power to grant students special admittance, or “admission by exception,” unless the admittance is approved by three college administrators. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
