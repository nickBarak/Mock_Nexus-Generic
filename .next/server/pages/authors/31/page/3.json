class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Senate also recommended that the UC conduct additional research into other admissions avenues, such as going “test optional.”<em> Breana Lepe / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Senate also recommended that the UC conduct additional research into other admissions avenues, such as going “test optional” or using alternative standardized tests beyond the ACT and the SAT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Standardized Testing Task Force’s (STTF) report comes on the heels of a brewing debate as to whether or not universities should amend their policies to either forgo requiring standardized testing results altogether or to make submitting them optional. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November, prominent UC administrators, including UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ and UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive, supported the elimination of standardized testing after they deemed it a barrier for underserved students, the Los Angeles Times </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-23/uc-officials-recommend-dropping-sat-admission-requirement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point in time, the Academic Senate still supports the use of standardized testing, namely because it is unclear how altering the standardized testing policy will affect the admissions process as a whole, systemwide diversity and consistency among applicants, the task force said in its report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC — which receives the largest volume of SAT scores in the nation — were to alter its standardized testing requirements at this time, the report noted that “such a move could have significant, unanticipated, and undesirable effects” on students who plan to apply to a UC school in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the STTF report, the UC currently uses standardized tests for four purposes: to assess academic preparation and achievement, to use as markers for success beyond high school GPA, to establish eligibility and to aid in admitting students at individual campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But standardized testing is only one part of a 14-measure suite of admissions practices used by UC campuses, called a “comprehensive review,” according to the report. The “comprehensive review” encompasses students’ academics and backgrounds to factor in social disparities, the report said.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara and UC Riverside weigh students’ applications based on their standardized test scores before the “comprehensive review” stage. At UCSB, SAT and ACT scores comprise 20 to 25% of a students’ admission score, depending on major, according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At all other UC campuses, however, applications enter the “comprehensive review” stage without a weight assigned to their standardized test scores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Test scores are still weighted less than high school grades, and “admissions decisions are ultimately made based on a review of all the information available in the applicant’s file.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the predictive power of test scores, or how accurately the tests reflect eligibility, has increased in the past decade, the report found, while the predictive power of high school grades has decreased. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also said that current standardized testing procedures may be a possible contributor to the underrepresentation of different groups at UC campuses. Almost 60% of California high school graduates are underrepresented minorities (URM), but only 37% of California resident students admitted to a UC school in 2019 were URMs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also acknowledged that the UC’s admissions procedures do not fully compensate for students’ racial and socioeconomic disparities, but found that “for any SAT score, students from disadvantaged groups have a higher probability of being admitted than students from advantaged groups.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to its recommendation to continue using standardized tests, the report also said the UC should steer clear of using the Smarter Balanced Assessment </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consortium </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(SBAC) in lieu of the current standardized tests, such as the ACT or SAT. The SBAC, which 11th grade California students take in high school, is aligned to a different set of academic standards and carries risks that are either not present or not as extreme in the ACT or SAT, according to the report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The task force was deeply concerned with a wide range of risks related to the adoption of SBAC to meet UC admissions requirements, including (but not limited to) test security, item exposure control, and item bank size,” the report read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report will now move on to the UC’s entire Academic Senate for systemwide input. Then, the Academic Senate will forward its recommendation to UC President Janet Napolitano, who will make a recommendation to the UC Board of Regents to make a final decision in May. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

There, he helped to facilitate the Central Coast’s first-ever cannabis community and grew a passion for connecting with growers, testifying in court for cannabis regulations and fostering the local cannabis community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Spring Quarter 2019, he was approached by the president of UC Los Angeles’ (UCLA) Cannaclub, who reached out to encourage him to start his own chapter at UC Santa Barbara.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The president] said, ‘Zain, you go to UCSB, why don’t you empower the student voice, why don’t you give the students a voice in the [cannabis] community?’” Qureshi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t know whether there’s going to be a big interest in [the club]. I didn’t know because I was working with professionals in the field for so long. Students were kind of out of the picture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi created the club that same quarter, which he said was a straightforward process because UCLA’s Cannaclub had already given him all the tools necessary to replicate it at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi’s next step after forming the club was to register it through the Office of Student Life, which he said wasn’t a problem because “[we] weren’t promoting sales, consumption or distribution. It was purely educational.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After registering the club, Qureshi said he pooled some friends together to form Cannaclub’s first executive board. Combined with his past experience in the cannabis industry, he said getting the club off its feet “wasn’t really a problem.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We threw our first event on cannabis and mental health last spring. That was an incredibly informative, hard-opening panel,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had a really good turnout too, which was awesome because I couldn’t gauge the interest of the school, but when so many people showed up, I was like, ‘Hey, this is real, you know, like people are actually interested in it,’” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But come Fall Quarter 2019, Cannaclub went dormant when Qureshi left for the quarter to study abroad. After returning for winter quarter, he said he focused his efforts on bringing the club back to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, he said he has a stronger executive team and more people “who are focused on being interested in joining the cannabis industry after college,” which enables the club to work toward one of its central pillars: community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qureshi said he also hopes to inform students about the cannabis industry, create awareness and destigmatize the use of cannabis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the [club’s] pillars is to give people the right tools. Another pillar was to create a more informed, healthier and more conscious community. Statistically speaking, Gauchos are some of the biggest stoners,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took that and I was like, ‘Okay, do people really know what they’re smoking? Do they even know what they’re buying?’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Locally based cannabis companies — such as Hemp Blank, Green Rush Alliance and Delta Leaf Laboratories — have helped Cannaclub expand by providing the club with resources, speakers and apparel</span>, all of which have contributed to the club’s main goals of education, awareness and entrepreneurship, Qureshi said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, Qureshi envisions Cannaclub as a space where members can attend biweekly meetings and mingle with professionals within the cannabis industry while receiving educational sessions and tours throughout Santa Barbara’s cannabis scene. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for now, he has been focused on two things — creating different committees within the club and advertising through social media for upcoming events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of January, Cannaclub held an event called “Cannabis and Science,” where a handful of speakers gave talks to students in I.V. Theater about the dangers of vaping, cannabis technological innovations and plant genetics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later this month, Qureshi hopes to host another event, this time for networking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My vision is to throw something at the end of this month that focuses on networking for students at UCSB and students at SBCC,” Qureshi said. “[It will be at] at a venue downtown where we’ll bring out a lot of companies from the cannabis space, from sustainability to delivery to education.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although he’ll soon be leaving UCSB for a career in the cannabis industry, Qureshi hopes that Cannaclub is here to stay. Although the club’s presence on campus is still relatively small, Qureshi is confident that Cannalub will continue to grow over time — as long as the club doesn’t sway from its goal of bringing students together. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m trying to build a community, that’s all it is. I want people of all different majors. It doesn’t matter who you are or whatever you’re interested in,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have a place for you.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3</em><em> of the Feb. 6, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

roughly 200 students gathered under Storke Tower at 8 p.m. to mourn the loss of Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News of Bryant’s death sent ripples of emotion throughout the United States and the rest of the world. An icon to many, fans paid tribute to Bryant and his legacy by holding vigils all over the world, but most prominently at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, home to Bryant’s 20-year tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers, The New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/us/kobe-bryant-la-california.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UC Santa Barbara, about an hour and a half away from the crash site, an outpour of roughly 200 students gathered under Storke Tower at 8 p.m. to mourn the loss of Bryant, 41, and Gianna, 13.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university was also home to Bryant’s basketball camp, the </span><a href=\"http://www.youth-basketball-camps.com/camps/kobe-bryant-basketball-camp/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kobe Basketball Academy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which ran for eight years at the Thunderdome and was designed to help kids hone their basketball skills, </span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/kobe_bryant_impact_inspiration_santa_barbara_county_basketball_20200126\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noozhawk reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the center of the vigil rested a picture of Bryant and his daughter, a bouquet of flowers and a poster inscribed “RIP #24 MAMBA.” Bryant’s numbers — 8 and 24 — glimmered off the jerseys of students facing the candlelight, while shades of purple and gold draped the crowd from the many who sported Lakers attire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously, if you came out, Kobe meant a lot to you,” Nasrat Hamid, a fourth-year chemistry major and the event’s organizer, said to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s kind of crazy how someone I’m sure most of us have never met before had such a huge impact on our lives. It’s kind of silly when you think about it — I’ve never met this guy but here I am crying my eyes out because he just passed away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid organized the event earlier that same day after emailing Chancellor Henry T. Yang for permission to hold the vigil, and Yang helped provide Hamid with microphones for the event. After getting permission, Hamid’s sister, Nishat Hamid, said they used social media to let students know an event in Bryant’s honor would be taking place that night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamid spoke to the crowd first, leaving the microphone open for students who wanted to share their favorite memories about Bryant, the impact he had on their lives and what they’ll remember most about him. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As students spoke through the tears, those in the crowd banded together, arms wrapped around one another as they mourned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student who took the mic saw Bryant’s death as an opportunity to look back and resolve the negativities in life that weren’t worth the frustration they caused. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you have any conflict with anyone, maybe just resolve it and say ‘I love you,’ even in  a friendly way. It’s what Kobe would have wanted,” the student said. “I love that man, and even though I don’t know anyone here, I love you all.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just keep powering through [your] own lives and look around and love those near [you] because we are not guaranteed a tomorrow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the minutes leading up to the moment of silence at 8:24 p.m. — to honor both of Bryant’s jersey numbers — one student put his phone next to the microphone to play Lil Wayne’s “Kobe Bryant” after asking the crowd if they’d like to hear the song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a few minutes of silence, students resumed speaking to the crowd as others began to leave.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One student recalled how an introduction to basketball — and later, a passion for it — came from Bryant, who inspired them to pick up a ball after watching him on television. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m having fun. Kobe taught me how to love the game,” the student said. “I have this Kobe poster in my room and now I can’t look at it all that much anymore, just because it hurts that much.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I never got to watch Kobe live, I never got to meet him in person,” the student added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now, I will never get the chance to.”</span></p>\n<p>[<em>Correction Jan. 28, 8:33 a.m.]: In a previous version of this article, Nishat Hamid’s name was misspelled.

Courtesy of Dahlia Hylton</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last March, Chancellor Henry T. Yang </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/chancellor-yang-promises-fulfillment-of-multiple-bsu-demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promised</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to provide funding from his office for the creation of the office, the hiring of eight staff members — of which Hylton is the first — and $55,000 annually for programming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the creation of the office, Yang said that the development of a Center for Black Student Development, which is meant to be a standalone building, would be “an important priority within campus planning.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/bsu-releases-demands-to-address-black-student-resources-and-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">presented</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the BSU demands team in February and fulfilled by Yang in March but were built upon over 50 years of activism from previous generations of BSU students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton was selected after a national search by a committee comprised of members of the BSU demands team, as well as other campus leaders, according to Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Academic Support Systems Lupe Navarro-Garcia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton said she hadn’t heard about the demands before she saw the job announcement, but that she was aware of “some type of forward movement that was happening, as to why this office was being created.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I’m someone who literally stands on the shoulders of people who look like me, and to be able to be a vessel, if you will, for the amazing work that this institution has done,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students have played such a significant part in bringing this office together.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, a job posting by the Division of Student Affairs described the role of director as an individual who is both capable of overseeing and advising entities — such as the Black Resource Committee and Black Student Union (BSU) — while leading in strategic planning and participating in organizations from the local to national level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The search committee wanted someone that really understood the diversity within the Black community and really had a commitment to intersectional identities and making sure that everyone that set foot in the place where we have that space, or was interfacing with anyone with the office felt welcomed, seen and understood,” said Meridith Merchant, assistant director for Mental Health Initiatives and Inclusion for Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and member of the search committee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia noted that Hylton has worked in various multicultural affairs offices at different campuses and at her most recent university, Lehigh University, grew the office from one person to a full staff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the work that I have done, particularly within higher education, has been around diversity and inclusion,” Hylton added. “Even when I was cultivating those skills in undergrad and graduate, I just always gravitated towards a space like this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hylton noted that she has worked in advising offices, Educational Opportunity Program offices and admissions offices in addition to her work in multicultural spaces and said she’s looking forward to working with various offices at UCSB to help students in any way they need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to hold true to the demands that the students brought forth and however that actually manifests its ways, then we’ll actually do that,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Hylton said she’s focusing her time on learning what exactly the needs of the student are, and how she can help facilitate them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her first few days, she said she spent time getting to know a lot of different people on campus and building relationships, which she described as key to a position like hers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been able to meet, in my opinion, with some really great, great allies, or potential allies, of the space, and everyone seems so excited, which has given me a lot of energy,” Hylton said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, she’s ready to get to work creating a strategic plan for the office and begin hiring other staff members.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navarro-Garcia said they have already hired an assistant director who will begin Feb. 3, and are in the process of looking for an advocacy counselor and an administrative business officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As OBSD moves forward in filling positions, Merchant said “we have to be very intentional and thoughtful” in making future hires, as to meet the BSU demands and properly accommodate new employees as they arrive on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we have space in our suite here for the first tier [of hiring]?” Navarro-Garcia said. “And then we need to start thinking where are we moving to advance to the hiring of tier two and tier three.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar sense, Merchant emphasized the need to continue developing OBSD’s infrastructure in an effort to make future employees feel they can perform their job to the fullest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Santa Barbara is not the most diverse place to be. UC Santa Barbara is diverse, but Santa Barbara as a whole [is not],” Merchant said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re inviting people to positions where they’re going to be supporting multicultural students, it’s important that there is the infrastructure, so that you can draw people that will feel supported and be able to continue to do the great work that they’re doing,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hylton, she’s looking forward to doing just that. In the future, she hopes to help create a space where Black students can seek “empowerment, education and inspiration,” while providing them with the resources they need to succeed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really important that UC Santa Barbara realizes that Blackness isn’t monolithic. There’s so many different variations as to who we are as individuals. And to have this office to a vessel or a conduit to helping people understand what those many different nuances of Blackness is going to be really important.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

But after one evening nearly six years ago, many wondered if it would ever return. That was the night of the Isla Vista tragedy, an evening so devastating that it brought an entire community to its knees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista lost six of its own that night, while 14 others were injured. For a brief period of time, nearly everyone in Isla Vista could recall where they were that evening. But in a town defined by its high turnover, first-hand experiences diminished as students graduated, leaving business owners and long-term residents to bear the grief.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_92151\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1487152071\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"92146\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-92151\" data-attachment-id=\"92151\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/student-documentary-not-one-more-puts-a-story-of-tragedy-in-the-hands-of-community/courtsey-of-cameraon-leingang/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?fit=1535%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1535,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Cameraon Leingang\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?fit=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-92151\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1 187w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Courtsey-of-Cameraon-Leingang.jpg?w=1535&amp;ssl=1 1535w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92151\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“Not One More” aims to retell the story of the Isla Vista tragedy from a “survivor-based” angle. <em>Courtesy of Cameron Leingang</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to bring the first-hand perspective back into focus, a new documentary called “Not One More” aims to retell the story of the Isla Vista tragedy from a “survivor-based” angle that excludes the attacker’s name from the narrative, according to fourth-year film and media studies major Cameron Leingang, who is the documentary’s director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documentary’s narrative is instead established through interviews with politicians, UCSB faculty, psychologists, researchers, first responders and surgeons, giving viewers a previously unseen perspective into the events leading up to, during and after the Isla Vista tragedy, Leingang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The media has already done a great job of making sure that [the attacker] has been the focus of this event. So that is the last thing we’re going to do,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t know the victims’ stories. And if they did, people forget about them,” said Lexi Lunchick, a senior film and media studies major and the documentary’s producer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although they’re now confident in the film’s direction, with a bulk of its interviews already completed, Leingang said that he and Lunchick initially struggled over the summer to conceive a pitch for their Fall Quarter 2019 film class, which, if selected, would extend their class into Winter Quarter 2020 for the filming of the movie. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We weren’t really sure what we wanted to do, but we were still meeting frequently to talk, knowing that we wanted to pitch something,” Leingang said. “And then, this summer, we had a really bad string of mass shootings. There were three within a week — El Paso, Dayton and the [Gilroy] Garlic Festival right nearby.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it just kinda clicked that it was like, ‘Oh, this also happened here. Maybe this is something that needs to be told,’” he added. “That was kind of the spark.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the idea for a film in mind, Leingang, along with Lunchick, teamed up with fourth-year philosophy major and director of photography Alex Gorman, second-year film and media studies major and production manager Perris Burnley, second-year film and media studies major and editor Ily Logeais and third-year film and media studies major and sound mixer Aidan Mastrogiorgio to produce the documentary. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before getting a chance to pitch the film, Leingang said he first had to enroll in a pitch session during fall quarter. To do so, he, alongside 27 other students with pitches, raced to send in their pitches when the submission portal went live.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Whoever had the fastest computers — you’re in,” Lunchick said. “Only 13 [students] got into the actual pitch session, and in the first 60 seconds alone, there were, like, 23 applications,” Leingang added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leingang’s submission made it to the next round. Now flanked by his movie crew, Leingang said he competed against the 12 other teams in an on-stage pitching competition for four spots before a panel of judges that was comprised of industry professionals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If selected, Leingang said the team would have the opportunity to produce their movie during Winter Quarter 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The pitches happened on a Friday and they said that [the results] would get posted midday Monday,” Lunchick said. “We were sitting in class in Pollock [Theater] and we were told it was going to be [released at 12 o’clock] but one of the judges was late giving their answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I got up to go to the bathroom to go see if it was posted and my professor yelled at me to sit down,” Leingang added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But soon after, Leingang and Lunchick saw a Facebook post from their film and media studies group chat that announced which four groups would go on to produce their films. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the people posted the picture of the names of the four that got picked. As soon as we got the notification, we quickly looked and then saw that ours was on there,” Lunchick said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as Leingang and his team began planning out interviews shortly after the pitching competition, he said they faced a problem early on: They “had no credibility; we’re just a student film.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leingang said he reached out to Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead and graduate student Melissa Barthelemy, who is writing her dissertation on the Isla Vista tragedy, to help assemble sources. UCSB also aided him in contacting the victims’ parents, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the other crews started filming very quickly, which was panicking at the beginning,” Leingang said. “But once we started rolling, we had names on our film of people who are respected and people who have stories … we’ve had great success with almost everyone we’ve reached out to.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following pre-production, which took about five weeks, Leingang said the team then began filming in mid-November. By mid-February, Leingang said he aims to have all the filming completed in anticipation for its release sometime in March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While conducting interviews, Leingang said he and his team were always sensitive to the grief their subjects were experiencing but was surprised by how “open and willing” people were once the interview began. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the time, the very first thing they say to me is, ‘Thank you for doing this,’” Leingang said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of our interviews was just talking about how it’s good to talk about [the tragedy] every once in a while,” he added. “People are finding it cathartic.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a broader sense, Leingang said the film’s narrative has been heavily shaped by what has been gathered through interviews: “very strong personal stories” that built an understanding of “what they experienced that night, what happened and what happened the next day.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the team conducted interviews — which included a mid-quarter trip to Kentucky — Leingang took note of a common thread expressed by many people who spoke on camera: “What a lot of our interviews have stressed so far is a call for sanity,” in that many people are still overcoming the shock associated with the tragedy.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Lunchick, filming the documentary has been a learning experience, in part because working on the film has exposed her to the changes in Isla Vista since the tragedy, such as the bushes planted at sorority Alpha Phi after two women lost their lives there.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that future generations of UCSB students are always going to be affected,” she said. “You never know if one other student walking by knew someone or their sibling that went here before knew someone.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar sense, Leingang said he came out of producing the film with a new sense of appreciation for life and how quickly things can change in the wake of tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve emphasized this the entire time; you don’t really think it’s going to happen to you or where you live and then to actually have it happen and to you,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We interviewed someone who was supposed to hang out with the girls that ended up being killed. They made a last-minute decision to do something else and if she would’ve continued hanging out with them, who knows what would’ve happened. Stuff like that, it’s eerie, and it sends chills down your spine.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the film makes its initial debut as a 30-minute final project for Leingang’s two-quarter film class, he and Lunchick said they hope to produce an extended version — an hour-long “documentary feature” —  to submit to film festivals in hopes of drawing more attention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recalling all the hardships, memories and interviews experienced while producing the documentary, Lunchick said she finds herself returning to the time she and the team flew to Kentucky to interview Bob Weiss, who lost his daughter, Veronika, in the tragedy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Something that we realized while we were there is just how one decision of where you are at one point can just change everything for everyone,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there, Lunchick said she had the chance to flip through a photo album that Veronika Weiss had made before she died. Though they had never met, Lunchick said she felt a connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s hard to sometimes believe that such tragic events really happened,” she said. “And it’s moments like that that really stick out and once again feel surreal with it all and put it into perspective that this event was real.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Veronika touched this. We’re holding this book that’s hers.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of the article appeared on p.3 of the Jan. 23 edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

It was signed by 20 student sponsors.</span> <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill, which will be read by the Senate during next week’s meeting, requires a two-thirds vote by UC Santa Barbara students during the Spring 2020 election to take effect during the 2020-21 school year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was authored by Off-Campus Senator Tyler Ferguson and seconded by On-Campus Senator Emma Swanson. It was signed by 20 student sponsors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An international student, as </span><a href=\"http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/apply/international\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">defined by UC Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because there is no International Student Senator, struggles specific to international students are not actively being addressed in the ASUCSB Senate to the best of the Senate’s ability,” the bill reads, citing UCSB’s 12% international student population. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To accommodate the addition of a new Senate position, the bill suggests that the current number of off-campus senators be reduced from 12 to 11 to keep the overall number of senators at 25 — an odd number that ensures “the Internal Vice President does not receive much more power in becoming a tie-breaking vote.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution noted that a similar situation has occurred in the past, when the Associated Students (A.S.) constitution was amended in Spring Quarter 2016 for the creation of a transfer student senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson said he decided to propose the bill following months of conversations with members of the International Student Advisory Board (ISAB) and the Global Gaucho Commission (GGC), who both expressed a “heavy interest” in the creation of an international student senator position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the bill, the position of an international student senator “or equivalent” already exists at universities such as UC San Diego and UC Los Angeles.

That’s just my environment,” he said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But neither of those things happened. Through perseverance and mentorship, he reshaped his destiny. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios, 42, is now a professor in the sociology department at UC Santa Barbara and the subject of a new documentary called “The Pushouts,” which traces through 25 years of his life and his work with a youth center in Watts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, Rios studies underprivileged youth with upbringings similar to his own. Akin to finding a cure for a disease, Rios said “there is no silver bullet” in solving the problem of underprivileged youth and social disparities. But after 15 years of research, he said he has noticed a pattern. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all need a Yoda in life, right?” Rios said. “You want to have someone to turn to when you’re having a rough time and you want someone to turn to when you need an answer to a question that’s difficult to answer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But for many of us, we might not have that Yoda.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for a long time, Rios himself didn’t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But one day, while sitting in a high school computer science class, his teacher, Flora Russ, extended him an offer he had never been given before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Russ] would always say to me when she saw me at school, ‘Victor, you might not be ready right now, but when you’re ready, I’ll be here for you,’” Rios said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was having a really tough time, when I hit rock bottom and my best friend had been killed and I was looking for that opportunity, I talked to her,” he added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Russ told him that she’d be glad to help, but he had to put in the work to make it happen. At the end of high school, Rios graduated on time and went on to receive his bachelor’s degree at California State University, East Bay and later attended graduate school at UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios said Russ was different because “she cared for the whole person.” She enabled him to consistently spend time in school instead of on the streets and would “even go to my house and look for me and ask how I was doing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His personal experience with Russ cemented his belief in the importance of using guidance as a key for success. Along with empathy, which Rios described as “step one” to supporting students, the role of a teacher and education system should not only tell students how to succeed but also show them, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rios finds that the education system has a habit of pushing students aside that can’t keep up, leaving them stuck where they are. Instead, Rios believes that every student should have the power to control their education without the threat of being told “you’re not ready. You’re no longer part of this career trajectory.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This style of education is otherwise known as mastery learning, according to Rios, in which students are encouraged and supported in their studies by using tools and resources provided to them to achieve their goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastery learning contrasts traditional classes, Rios said, where “the first thing you hear from a professor is, ‘Welcome everyone. Half of you are going to fail this class,’” leading to student drop out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But using the label “dropout” puts blame in the wrong place, according to Rios. Instead, he uses the term “pushout” to better address the situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we label a kid a dropout, it puts all the blame on them, ignoring whatever issues the student may have,” Rios told NBC. “Pushout is a better term, because it forces schools and educators to think about who they are failing, and what they can do about it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If educators encouraged more than discouraged, Rios believes students would experience a system that supports them at their lowest and lends a hand when they’ve been knocked down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good example is in the classroom, where Rios said students’ academic outcomes are increased when teachers hone in on the emotional side of their students, which can take as little as five minutes per class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Education really has to be, from kindergarten all the way to college, an experience where you feel as a student that someone’s got your back. That someone is feeling what you’re going through and respecting what you’re going through,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a professor, Rios does just that and supports students in the same manner he said Russ supported him: with acceptance and empathy. When students approach him for help, Rios acknowledges that he’s not a “mental health expert,” but as a mentor, will always do what he can. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To have a college student come to you and say, ‘I’m feeling a little broken inside,’ and kind of brush it off — you can’t do that,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of [my] best therapeutic moments have not been with mental health experts, professionals or therapists. My best mental health moments have been with my mentors, with my Yodas and with my guides.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the 2014 tragedy in Isla Vista, Rios, alongside a handful of other professors, began hosting “midnight office hours” in Isla Vista to offer students an outlet for support. The idea came out of empathy, according to Rios — he and his colleagues wanted to support students at a time when emotions were at a high and hope was at a low. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students would get a kick out of it because some of them would show up drunk with tequila bottles in their hand. They’d call me by my last name … and we just sat there, a group of professors, and talked to students,” Rios said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of them, though, you could tell they were lonely. They were roaming the streets of Isla Vista on their own, sober. But [they] just needed someone to talk to,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a larger level, Rios would like to see society move away from some of its “punitive” qualities and opt for more compassionate methods, such as restorative justice and giving students second chances. In turn, Rios envisions a society where people are more empathetic to one another’s struggles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With his own life experiences in mind, Rios said he is dedicated to helping others go about their lives in a way that makes them feel supported — and never alone. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My noble purpose is to help those that are suffering and struggling to find a way out, and then have them go and help others,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s how we build a more compassionate world.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

But in a new deal with Hawaii County, made on Dec. 26, protestors have instead agreed to move aside and unblock the access road, Hawaii News Now reported. The protestors will still remain at the site.</p>\n<p>Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said in a letter to protesters that “there will be no attempt to deliver construction equipment to Maunakea anytime soon.” Additionally, he added that “State and County agencies and law enforcement agencies will agree to stand down… there will be no attempt to remove [the] protector’s encampment.”</p>\n<p>The project has drawn significant controversy since its groundbreaking in October 2014 and has remained a subject of criticism from Native Hawiians who claim it is desecrating Mauna Kea, believed to be one of the most sacred areas in all of Hawaii, according to Smithsonian Magazine.</p>\n<p>The decision to halt construction came from the TMT International Observatory LLC (TMT) over safety concerns for workers and protestors, according to a statement from Gordon Squires, vice president for external relations for TMT.</p>\n<p>“The state and Hawaii County have not demonstrated that they are able to provide safe, sustained access to Maunakea for everyone,” Squire said. In the past six months alone, the Hawaiian Government has spent over $15 million on law enforcement for the site, the Star Advisor reported.</p>\n<p>Squire also noted that the organization is taking opposition to its project into account.</p>\n<p>“We are sensitive to the ongoing struggles of indigenous populations around the world, and we will continue to support conversations around TMT and the larger issues for which it has become a flashpoint,” he continued.</p>\n<p>Yang currently chairs the Thirty Meter Telescope’s board of governors, and his involvement faced backlash over the summer from students who opposed the project.</p>\n<p>In September, the UC Student Association (UCSA), which is comprised of every UC student government, wrote a letter opposing the telescope and the UC’s involvement in the project.</p>\n<p>In December, UCSB’s Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) and the American Indian Student Association (AISA) brought Native Hawaiian protestors to campus to discuss their opposition to the project and urge students to support their cause.</p>\n<p>Despite the announcement about pausing TMT’s construction, Hawaiian elders and protest leaders said they were skeptical about TMT’s decision to pause construction after initially being given a deadline to vacate the area, according to the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>“[Governor Ige] making an obtuse statement that TMT has announced that they’re not coming for a while just doesn’t hold any water for us,” Noe Noe Wong-Wilson, a protest leader, told the Star Advisor.</p>\n<p>Daevionne Beasley, the EVPSA of UCSB’s Associated Students, called the new announcements a “ploy” to remove protestors from Mauna Kea and clear the area for construction to resume.</p>\n<p>“When I had first heard [TMT was] halting the construction, I thought it was a good idea,” Beasley said, who has previously spoken to Yang about his involvement with TMT and is a co-signer of the UCSA letter.</p>\n<p>But combined with the fact that protesters have to move their tents to the side of the access road, Beasley believes “the government is trying to push [protesters] out so that [TMT is] able to go in and resume construction whenever they see fit.”</p>\n<p>Beasley also believes the protesters’ biggest point of contention with TMT — its location on historically sacred land — can be remedied by breaking ground in a new location that doesn’t impose on “someone else’s indigeneous land.”</p>\n<p>“The only solution in my head is to pause all development on the telescope until science is able to advance where [TMT doesn’t] have to build a telescope in an area where it would affect indigenous people,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The backlash mainly took shape in the form of student-created petitions that circulated earlier this summer, asking Yang to step down from his role as chair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the speakers, Hawaiian activist Laulani Teale, emphasized that the crux of the conflict between Native Hawaiians and TMT is a matter of consent, as the developers of TMT are operating on land where many people native to it were not given the chance to approve the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation continued, Pisciotta moved on to address a common accusation the protestors faced, that by standing against TMT, Native Hawaiian protestors are also standing against science. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nobody’s against science,” Pisciotta said. “The science was asking us, ‘What is our alternative [to building TMT]?’ But that question doesn’t belong to us. It actually belongs [to those working on the telescope].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“How can you build something 18 stories high, [with a] stadium-size footprint and not frustrate the endangered species and the land and the water of Mauna Kea? So the question now becomes ‘How does science innovate to find a better solution that doesn’t do that?”’ she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In July, dozens of Hawaiian elders were arrested for obstructing Mauna Kea’s only access road, the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/science/mauna-kea-protest.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including Liko Martin, the “Bard of Aloha ‘Aina,” who attended Tuesday’s town hall. Martin spoke, sang and played guitar to the town hall’s attendees, performing several songs in which he wrote about Hawaii’s occupation by the U.S. government and the proposed development of TMT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin compared his time in the Hawaiian courthouse after he was arrested for protesting to being on an “auction block,” with a frenzy of lawyers vying to represent the elders as they entered the courthouse. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was 33 of us [arrested]. The night before we went in there … I got the feeling [that] tomorrow we’re going to be on the auction block,” Martin said. “That’s exactly how it came down. All these attorneys are running around like, ‘We’ll take this one!’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was like throwing my fishing hook in [the courthouse]. I didn’t even have to put any bait on it,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are currently 13 other telescopes on Mauna Kea, but none as expensive as TMT, which is estimated to cost over a billion dollars, the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/science/hawaii-telescope-tmt-mauna-kea.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times Reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; $300 million of the funding will be provided by the UC and Caltech, partially funded through a $200 million donation from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=gordon+and+betty+moore+foundation+tmt&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS791US791&amp;oq=gor&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4j69i60l2.1253j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foundation’s website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student fees are not used as part of TMT’s funding, according to Claire Doan, UC Office of the President spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If completed, TMT will provide images 12 times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope, according to a </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/thirty-meter-telescope-will-be-most-powerful-eye-sky\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Construction on the telescope, however, won’t be complete until at least 2030, assuming construction begins in 2020, Teale said.

Otherwise, TMT’s lease for the land will expire, and “the people of Hawaii have been very clear that they have no intention to renew [the] lease.” </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91724\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/mauna-kea_kaiyi-yang_online/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-91724\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91724\" data-attachment-id=\"91724\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/mauna-kea_kaiyi-yang_online/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=2048%2C1393&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1393\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Mauna Kea_Kaiyi Yang_ONLINE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?fit=888%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-91724\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=888%2C604\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"604\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=768%2C522&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?resize=1024%2C697&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mauna-Kea_Kaiyi-Yang_ONLINE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91724\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although criticism of Yang’s involvement with TMT sparked earlier this summer, Daevionne Beasley, the Associated Students (A.S.)

He did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p>Steil had <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-23/ucsb-student-arrested-for-isla-vista-assault-previously-arrested-for-beating-of-rival-frat-member-at-mississippi/\">also been previously arrested</a> for assault in Mississippi in 2015, when he was a freshman at the University of Mississippi.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon arrival, officers arrested Steil, who had “blood on his clothing.” The victim was bleeding from their lip following the altercation with Steil, according to the booking report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the booking report, a witness at the scene spoke to the officers, stating that they saw the “victim and &amp; Steil (suspect) fighting/throwing punches and that the word ‘faggot’ was being exchanged.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Oscar Perez, a second-year UCSB student who spoke to the Nexus, Perez was walking to Rockfire Grill when he and his group of friends were approached by a man </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who Perez later identified as Steil — with blood on his shirt, who began following them. The man also called one of Perez’s friends a homophobic slur, Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t know what he was going to do so we were just telling him ‘Go home.’ Everyone was telling him to go home. We were all thinking he was going to fight us, but he didn’t,” Perez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the man left, a woman approached them “checking for blood on our hands,” Perez added. Perez pointed out the man who had been following them to the woman, who she then ran up to. She was looking for the man who was “saying all the bad stuff about homosexuals,” according to another student present at the scene who requested to remain anonymous and verified Perez’s recounting of the events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, the man punched her and began kicking her while she was on the ground; a fight then began between an unknown number of people in the middle of Pardall Road, near Six Pak Shop, according to the unnamed student.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once detained, Steil admitted to officers that he used the word “faggot” during the altercations and that he had consumed multiple alcoholic beverages that night, according to the booking report; the report also stated that “[Steil] was determined to be the aggressor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A person who identified themselves as a victim of the incident posted on Twitter detailing their injuries: “The word ‘FAGGOT’ cost me a concussion, 7 stitches, a fractured nose, and 3 broken teeth,” they said, adding that one of the women assaulted also had a hand broken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also stated that they will be “taking all actions necessary to have [the attacker] face all possible consequences.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The chancellor, judicial affairs, and anywhere else. Enough is enough. There is no room for hate, only love,” one of the tweets read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because news of the Rockfire altercation spread quickly through social media, many students and community members had learned about the situation through unofficial channels, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board President Ethan Bertrand said at the Nov. 12 meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bertrand addressed the incident and criticized the lack of communication between the community and public safety agencies when serious situations arise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s absolutely maddening that members of this board and members of the community heard about this through Twitter and not from our public safety agencies who respond to this. And I say that it’s maddening because we’ve dealt with this before,” Bertrand said during the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unacceptable and offensive as a member of this Isla Vista LGBTQ community to have this go on and for it to not be worthy of public attention and not to be worthy of a serious community response.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the board discussed the availability of I.V. CSD press releases to the public, one student — who said they are friends with one of the victims in the Rockfire incident — echoed Bertrand’s thoughts regarding the critical role that widely available information plays in the public.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that multiple sexual assaults have occurred this past month and there was a hate crime against someone who’s actually very near to my heart, it is not okay that we don’t have people standing up for us,” said the student, who did not identify themselves at the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing a press release with transparency would be really helpful to the community to help us heal. Having all these incidents back to back to back has been a lot for a lot of different students and showing survivors that there are these resources that you provide as our government on a local level would be very beneficial,” the student continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During public forum at the Nov. 13 Associated Students Senate meeting, Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi also spoke about the altercation and described the incident as a “homophobic hate crime.” She added that one of the victims sustained a concussion, seven stitches and a broken jaw.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to advocate for this,” she said. “Not because this person asked me to but because hate crimes in our community aren’t something we expect, because we believe that everyone is open minded.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do have to remember there are some people in our community who do hold that hate in their heart.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hadidi called for more transparency between law enforcement, the university and its students, telling the Senate that, “I think it’s a little bit unacceptable that some of you are looking at me like you’re hearing this for the first time and that we haven’t heard about it as a community from our administration.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, on Nov. 14, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and Assistant Vice Chancellor and Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead sent an email to all students regarding a “physical assault” incited by “homophobia, racism, and/or xenophobia.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We find acts of violence intolerable, and those motivated by bias rooted in homophobia, racism, and other oppressive prejudices particularly despicable,” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB administration is currently in contact with those involved, according to the email, and said the absence of a Timely Warning was a result of the crime occurring on a location not covered by the Clery Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email included a promise from administrators to keep a clear line of communication with students regarding safety concerns. Previously, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">administration held a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-11/ucsb-administration-addresses-students-concerns-following-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1574324944756000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKjRIafuPWGx52Xw-pAsjfuXkXFQ\">town hall</a> where students voiced a need for active communication between public officials and the community, following <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-28/rape-reported-at-sigma-pi-house-third-sexual-assault-allegation-in-past-month/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1574325528870000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEEAgAkwkBcTqUPieQ7tHGQ2Fe6DA\">multiple allegations of sexual assault</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, we want to share this information with you promptly so that you are aware of the incident and know that we are responding,” Klawunn and Armistead added in the email. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 21, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [Nov. 23, 9:01 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

contracted employees was passed by the UC Regents (pictured at an earlier meeting).</span> <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policy comes on the heels of intense backlash from unions in response to the UC’s outsourcing practices. On Wednesday, workers represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME 3299) held their sixth strike in two years after the union filed <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-11-06/afscme-files-six-new-unfair-labor-practice-complaints-against-uc-plans-to-strike-nov-13/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573718186508000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0IXQTx92iJhsPGSRrVXxo8SDUoQ\">six unfair labor practice complaints</a> against the UC in early November. A majority of the complaints addressed the UC’s alleged use of “secretive” contracts to outsource labor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the news of a policy aimed to internalize a majority of the UC’s workforce, AFSCME is not yet convinced this policy will clear the air on the alleged workforce offenses the UC has committed in the past. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over the last several years, thousands of UC service and patient care workers have stood together to expose the university’s unfair, unsafe and often illegal outsourcing of UC jobs. Now, after years of dismissing the problem and the racialized inequality it creates, the Board of Regents is finally acknowledging the need to change course,” the union said in a statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A “policy” isn’t worth the paper its [sic] printed on unless it is actually enforced… UC’s abysmal track record makes clear that only state legislation or binding contract language can deliver the accountability that’s needed to uplift UC’s most vulnerable low wage workers and to stop the university from outsourcing more jobs,” the union continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/nov19/g2attach.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573719471565000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKJ1q3jBL_aDWK9Uf3jxQEf96lZw\">policy</a> would cover all campuses and affect a substantial amount of contractible services, such as custodial, food, healthcare and transportation services. No official date for the policy’s implementation has been set, but guidelines to roll out the policy would be established “no later” than Jan. 31, 2020, according to the policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the umbrella of the new policy, the UC is allotted few instances in which outsourced labor will be permitted: if the services are needed in an emergency, if the UC is unable to provide the required equipment or personnel internally, if the services are related to property transactions, if the services would be more convenient to contract out or if services provided by “registry personnel in clinical operations” are not sufficient enough to respond to “staffing needs,” according to the policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policy also offers contracted workers, who often work for lower wages and with fewer benefits, an opportunity to be adopted by the UC as university employees if the requirements for their employment are met. In turn, the “in-sourcing” of contracted employees will provide them with the full wages and salaries offered by the UC, according to the policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Individuals employed by service contractors who have provided those services to the University on a continuous basis for 12 months or more may request to be converted to University employment,” the policy continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the intake of contracted workers, employees under “covered services” — contracted services that are qualified to remain outsourced — are mandated by the new policy to be provided with “wages and benefits that are equivalent to the University wages and benefits provided to University employees performing the same work,” the policy read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, according to the policy, should “covered services” displace university employees, the university is required to open another position of a similar nature, which must “be in the same bargaining unit and at the same campus, medical center, or Laboratory” and provide matching wages and benefits corresponding to the displaced position.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, the new policy is expected to incur roughly an additional $108 million in costs for the UC, as stated at the meeting; the number was calculated by factoring in the cost of supplementing contracted work for insourced work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Richard Leib commented on the policy at Wednesday’s Governance Committee meeting, predicting that the UC, as the third largest employer in California, may encounter difficulty implementing the policy as “there are certain administrative tasks that are going to make it difficult for our campuses who are under a lot of other pressures.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, he maintained that implementing the policy will better reflect the values of the UC and those who work for it.“This is the right thing to do,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the prospect for better employment opportunities, wages and benefits through the policy, Todd Stenhouse, communication director for AFSCME, said the union was still doubtful. Stenhouse said three bills passed through the California Legislature between 2015 and 2017 — SB 574, 959and 376 — all of which attempted to “ensure commensurate pay between contractors and employees who do the same job.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC “very publicly and vocally” lobbied to kill the three bills, all of which were vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown, Stenhouse said. Decisions like these pose a significant threat to employees, he said, especially those where financial insecurity constantly looms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These are not individuals that can afford to say, ‘Hey, you know, I’m good without a day’s pay,’” Stenhouse said. “These are people that don’t make a lot of money as it is. They see the pain and the harm and the insecurity that these practices have allowed to fester.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Stenhouse sees the policy as a sign of “progress” to AFSCME, the new policy “is hardly a finish line.” Stenhouse wants to see the UC keep its word and carry out on procedures that have been long overdue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a matter of concern across the state. We’re talking about communities across California. We’re talking about thousands of very vulnerable workers who are effectively doing the same jobs in many cases, full time, in many cases for years on end,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A first-class university does not have second-class workers. It is certainly high time for the University of California to not only talk the talk but to walk the walk.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Update [Nov. 15, 5:50 p.m.]: This article has been updated to include information about the full Regents’ vote on Thursday. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
