","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Sophie Xu, a recent UC Santa Barbara alumna who graduated in March 2019, purchased Sweet Alley from longtime friend and owner Peter Sun, she had no idea what to do with all the extra frozen yogurt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So she gave it away for free. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 15, the Sweet Alley franchise in Isla Vista opened its doors for the last time, celebrated by a large line eager to get a final taste of the store’s nine-year legacy. With the doors now closed, Xu has begun preparing to transition the store into Vons Chicken, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a San Jose-based franchise that serves over 10 different renditions of authentic Korean fried chicken. The store will be one of seven Vons franchises in the state and the only one in Southern California.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88793\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88793\" data-attachment-id=\"88793\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/korean-fried-chicken-restaurant-set-to-open-in-i-v-in-coming-months/sweet-alley_ida-kazerani_online/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Sweet Alley_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88793 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-Alley_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88793\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xu said she is looking forward to the day she can flip the “closed” sign outside the store. </span><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For customers who are looking to avoid the grease, Xu said she will be expanding Vons’ menu to include oven-cooked chicken as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xu said she originally had no intention to buy Sweet Alley, as she already owns and manages Goleta restaurants Uniboil and Phresh Teas. But with the help of perfect timing and a movie that changed her mind, Xu decided to open her wallet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a Korean movie about policemen who watch drug dealers from a fried chicken place across the street. The fried chicken place was about to close down, so they bought the place to watch the drug dealers,” Xu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three days later, Xu offered to purchase Sweet Alley from Sun on a whim, who had been struggling to find a new owner for months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw [Sun’s] advertisement, and then the next day, I asked him if [Sweet Alley] is still on the market. He said, ‘Yes.’ And then the next day, I gave him the deposit.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With renovations set to begin next month, Xu wants to welcome customers with a completely new interior. On top of selling the frozen yogurt equipment, she plans to tear down old walls and refurnish the entire store; she is also flirting with obtaining a light liquor license. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The internal wall will be knocked down and moved further back, and I’ll add a small countertop so this whole area can be a sitting area,” she said, pointing to the concrete slab where customers used to walk up to get their frozen yogurt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TVs and dessert are also on Xu’s short list of amenities to include at her Vons, on top of the boba she plans to bring daily from Phresh Teas, a restaurant of hers dedicated to serving a variety of different tea creations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the unit’s small footprint, Xu estimates she will need roughly half the amount of employees she has staffed at her other restaurants. Instead of hiring former Sweet Alley employees, Xu said she will be “pick[ing] from Uniboil staff” and offering them a spot at the new store. Xu expects Vons will be managed by the wife of the current Uniboil head chef.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure authenticity, Xu said Vons flies trainers directly from South Korea to host trainings for employees whenever a new store opens — a franchise policy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Uniboil, which follows a more traditional restaurant style, Xu plans to make Vons more expedient so customers can just “grab and go.” If a customer simply wants to buy food and leave, Xu estimates they can be on their way in as little as 10 minutes. If customers would like to stay and eat, however, they’ll have plenty of time to choose when to come in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, I’m thinking Monday through Thursday, we’ll do 3 o’clock to 11 o’clock and 3 o’clock to two in the morning Friday through Sunday,” Xu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If fried chicken isn’t enough to fill customers’s stomachs, Xu said desserts will be available as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ll be selling boba cake — a milk tea cake with boba on it — and also coconut jellos, which is made of coconut juice and real coconut with jello inside. We’ll also be selling Hong-Kong style desserts and street food,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further impress palates, Xu said she is working with a local chef who is skilled in making authentic “Chinese street snacks.” She said the chef currently works from home and only delivers food from his house. If everything goes according to plan, Xu said, those street snacks may soon be on Vons’ menu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xu also plans on developing a “really strong delivery system.” Not only will this allow Vons to serve food beyond its own walls, but it will also help the store remain competitive, as most restaurants in I.V. offer some form of delivery service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she has a lot of work ahead of her in the coming months, Xu said she is looking forward to the day she can flip the “closed” sign outside the store, which will be sometime in the beginning of Fall Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once complete, Xu said Vons will be the sole restaurant in I.V. where customers can sink their teeth into Korean-fried “flats” and “drums” — the industry-standard cuts of chicken that are commonly fried into delicacies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no good fried chicken around here. We only have KFC — not even a Popeyes or Wingstop. We don’t have anything. That’s why I think this will be a really good idea for a chicken place,” Xu said.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 version of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Local Affairs (EVPLA) Jeike Meijer, are not limited to the Beloved Community Project — they represent community as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Meijer, community is “a connection of people.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In kindergarten you see those globes with little people holding hands — that’s what I always think about when I think about community, as cheesy as it sounds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its inception, Collins Puente said the Beloved Community Project’s organizing committee, made up of 25 students and staff members, has helped sponsor and organize a variety of community outreach and healing events in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the second anniversary of the Isla Vista tragedy neared, Collins Puente said the A.S. body at the time sought to “honor and commemorate the lives lost” while also fostering conversations that would allow the community to heal from the tragedy in a positive manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2016, the Beloved Community Project began working toward that goal by hosting a two-day conference in I.V. with the hope to “bridge all parts of the community,” Collins Puente said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the conference — which took place in six different locations in I.V. — was a major stepping stone in the Beloved Community Project’s development and was sponsored and funded by over 30 different local organizations, including I.V. Youth Projects, St. George Family Youth Center, I.V. Food Co-op and I.V. Recreation and Parks District.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During one segment of the conference titled “I.V. Talks,” Collins Puente said “elders in the community, houseless members of the community and youth of the community” all spoke to their experiences in I.V. while “working toward a common goal.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said her most memorable experience with the Beloved Community Project took place during Fall Quarter 2018, when Meijer —  in collaboration with the Isla Vista Tenants Union and the Beloved Community — went door-to-door in I.V. and distributed the tote bags as a way to “introduc[e] people to their neighbors and Isla Vista.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other goods, each tote bag contained an “Isla Vista guide” with letters written by local middle school students. The letters asked that college students acknowledge the middle school students in the community and addressed “how to take care of this community for everybody,” Meijer said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88557\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/the-beloved-community-project-strives-to-serve-as-a-beacon-of-hope/people_s-park_ida-kazerani_online-6-3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-88557\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88557\" data-attachment-id=\"88557\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/the-beloved-community-project-strives-to-serve-as-a-beacon-of-hope/people_s-park_ida-kazerani_online-6-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"People_s Park_Ida Kazerani_ONLINE (6)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88557\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/People_s-Park_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE-6-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88557\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Collins Puente finds that taking care of the community does not always involve an event of its own.

CSD, expressed interest in the vending machine because “it doesn’t necessarily have to be run in the traditional way that a food pantry is.” </span>Leonard<em> Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vending machine is intended to operate 24/7 and will likely be located outside the Isla Vista Community Room at 970 Embarcadero Del Mar, according to Sir. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the meeting, Sir said the roughly $14,000 refrigerated vending machine will be built by VendTek, a vending machine company that helps that allows customers to purchase items through a variety of different payment methods, according to the company’s </span><a href=\"https://www.vendtek.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir specifically picked VendTek because it would allow for qualified, low-income students’ perm numbers to be uploaded to the vending machine — all they would have to do is swipe their access card. For Santa Barbara City College and non-student low-income residents, Sir said VendTek will provide specially-made cards with barcodes so they can access the vending machine as well.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, Sir planned to have the vending machine stationed on campus, but, after working with UC Santa Barbara administration, she was informed that it would conflict with the school’s “vending machine contracts,” forcing her to take the project off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spencer Brandt, board president of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), expressed interest in the vending machine because “it doesn’t necessarily have to be run in the traditional way that a food pantry is.” However, Sir said the new vending machine will acquire food in a similar manner by obtaining “pre-made, unsold food items.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jacob Bider, a third-year environmental studies major, worked with Sir to help find potential sources for food donations. Bider originally canvassed local restaurants such as Bagel Cafe, Buddha Bowls, Cajé, Woodstocks and Pizza My Heart to gauge their interest in donating to a food pantry. He assumed they would also express interest in donating to a vending machine with similar goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also reached out to the local Trader Joe’s and Amazon outlets, both of which expressed interest in making food donations in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir noted that “about 48% of UCSB undergraduate students surveyed and 31% of graduate students surveyed do not have a consistent source of high-quality, nutritious food.” When food pantries are closed, usually around 7 p.m. at the latest, there is nowhere else to obtain a free meal either on campus or in I.V., according to Sir.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir believes the vending machine will also benefit students struggling with housing security, as some students do not have access to a dedicated kitchen to cook meals.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure proper health regulations when serving the repackaged food, Sir reached out to Kendra Wise, an environmental health specialist from the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since we are not profiting from this vending machine, we can register as a non-profit organization that’s distributing food.  [Wise] recommends that people who are going to help us get their training online to be able to handle this food and repackage it,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of our budget includes all the regulations of what we need to handle this food, and I will be working with Kendra Wise to make sure that this food will fit the Santa Barbara County health regulations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir placed heavy emphasis on the proposed vending machine’s location, because, unlike on-campus options such as the A.S. Food Bank, the vending machine will be open to non-student residents in I.V. — the only one of its kind.  </span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [May 20, 10:56 a.m.]: A previous version of this article wrongly stated the vending machine would be purchased through the company VendTech, but has been corrected to the right company, VendTek. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Oftentimes, Meijer said she found it hard to check every box while also trying to “pass the baton” to the next person taking office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer noted two specific platforms she ran on last year — establishing an emergency housing grant and expanding parking in I.V. — which both progressed throughout her term but ultimately failed to completely flesh out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After working with the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), Meijer constructed an outline for how an emergency housing grant would work but was not able to make it a reality. In the case of expanded parking, something that “basically every EVPLA has run on,” Meijer and her office were unable to resolve the problem — even after speaking with Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who told her there was little that could be done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So when I talked to Joan Hartmann about [parking], she was basically saying the answer from county is that there’s no solution,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, other projects saw more success. Meijer’s term was highlighted by a common theme of community outreach and safety, evident by substantial progress in both areas through multiple projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of addressing sexual assault, Meijer participated in spearheading new sexual assault and survivor policies as well as bystander intervention trainings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Fall Quarter 2018, Meijer began working with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) to help create a foundation for future events and projects throughout the year. Meijer worked with Associated Students (A.S.) On Campus Senator Zion Solomon and SASA President Emily Montalvo-Telford to provide funding and support for the SASA Survivor Healing events and bystander intervention trainings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bystander intervention trainings, which later made their way to the A.S. Senate table as a resolution, was created to assist </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/det-kovena-avila-named-new-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">newly-appointed Interpersonal Violence Investigator Kovena Avila</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by educating students on “how to report a sexual assault, what the reporting process is, what it looks like and what your rights are,” according to Meijer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer collaborated with law enforcement in other instances as well, such as working to develop a new police collaborative board, a previous campaign platform. By doing so, the collaborative board, which held its first meeting on May 13, will hopefully function to maintain open and “direct communication” between students and law enforcement, according to Meijer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer also hosted separate “eating events” with law enforcement during the year to continue fostering a better relationship between students and police. Meijer says the events — “Coffee with a Cop” and “Pizza with Police” — helped to provide students with information regarding road closures and parking restrictions during special events such as Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street lighting, a hot-button topic in I.V., saw significant progress through Meijer and her offices’ combined efforts with the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and Lobby Corps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After compiling data collected from a group walk through I.V. Fall Quarter 2018, the I.V. CSD and External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office released a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">street lighting report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which underscored areas where new lights are required and which current lights are in need of upgrades. Meijer says it will take more than “a couple of weeks” for work to begin, likely dragging the street lighting project through Fall Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer also collaborated with the Alcohol and Drug Program to provide </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/alcohol-drug-program-evpla-and-gauchos-for-recovery-host-naloxone-trainings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overdose prevention trainings for students and community members</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. During the training, Meijer said attendees were instructed on how to properly distribute naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose. Although the event took place at a similar time to Deltopia, Meijer said it was actually planned months in advance, at the beginning of Winter Quarter 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Meijer is currently working to equip UCSB’s Community Service Officers with naloxone, as the drug is currently limited to local law enforcement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around Halloween of Fall Quarter 2018, “the EVPLA office and IVTU went to every house in I.V. and brought everyone a tote bag,” Meijer said. Within the tote bag, community members received cards which noted road closures, important phone numbers and relevant resources. The cards were written in both Spanish and English. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before her term ends, Meijer said she has two final events planned as EVPLA: a Beloved Community “common table” and a five-year anniversary of the 2014 shootings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 18, Meijer said community members will have the opportunity to gather at People’s Park for an event sponsored by the Beloved Community Project. The “common table” is similar to a small conference, according to Meijer. She said the “community-bonding” event is strictly about “breaking bread” and mingling with fellow community members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 23, the fifth anniversary of the 2014 I.V. shootings, Meijer hopes to bring back elements from the first anniversary in 2015, when students and community members walked through campus and I.V. and wrote messages on eight different chalkboards in honor of those who lost their lives or were injured. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our plan is to get those chalkboards duplicated… we’re going to have flowers and ask entities to donate bouquets,” Meijer said. After walking past Storke Tower and down Pardall Road, attendees will “stop at Remembrance Garden and leave the flowers on each of the six benches.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a liaison between the university and the surrounding community, Meijer’s involvement with various organizations and initiatives reflect just how many doors she and her office have their feet in — a vital component of the position of EVPLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I tried my hardest but it was very humbling … hopefully my passion shows in my work and people can tell I was passionate through what I did,” Meijer said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christian Ornelas, a third-year environmental studies major currently serving as an off campus senator, will succeed Meijer for the 2019-2020 school year.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Mitchell was quick to address the uniqueness of his album’s title, tracing it back to his obsession of a childhood snack from the past. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t Touch My Danimals</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is something that’s really important to me. It’s who I am. It’s something that’s part of my childhood. It is me. I don’t want people to touch my childhood,” he said. Mitchell added that his inspiration stemmed from a renewed appreciation of the children’s yogurt, a name now shared among his newest album and his favorite snack. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Mitchell revealed that there’s more to it than just the name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I learned that in his Danimals prime, Mitchell did not like to share his yogurt as a kid, instead opting to keep it for himself. After departing from his prior band, N/A, Mitchell applied this same mentality to his newest pursuit — this time on a much bigger level. Almost all the vocal and musical elements for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t Touch My Danimals</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were crafted by Mitchell himself, an element of production he learned to embrace after deciding to embark on his project alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I felt like I was putting in more effort than everybody else [in the band] and I said ‘fuck that.’ I can just do things by myself. When people were pushing me to be my own artist, it kind of revamped me to where I was … So I learned from this group who I am and I’m going to go [do this] by myself,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we talked through the project’s five-month timeline, Mitchell elaborated on his unorthodox and experimental nature when producing the album. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I quickly became familiar with the fact that Mitchell is picky, a desirable trait in music. In “Sancho,” for example, Mitchell produced the track three separate times: once as a trap beat, once as a Mariachi beat and once as a “trap-Mariachi” beat. To produce the song “Tokyocitypop,” Mitchell had to sift through two years’ worth of his own archives to find what he was looking for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was going through old beats. I was making new beats. I was experimenting with beats. I was experimenting extremely with sound … I want [this album] to represent exactly how I’m processing this. I treat this album like a film. I’m the director, but I’m also the writer,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about his favorite memory with the album, Mitchell knew right away: the time he produced the third portion of “Tokyocitypop,” a track inspired by his feelings of hopeless romanticism. It didn’t come easily, though. After fabricating “four versions” of the track based off “15 different samples,” his thirst for the proper soundtrack was finally quenched.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music aside, Mitchell also worked to produce content that wasn’t limited to speakers. After $500, a trip to Studio City, a rented mansion and a camera crew, the music video for “Sancho” was born. “Bird” followed suit as well, in which Mitchell revealed there was “a whole lot of planning” and “a lot of different scenes.” </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88184\" style=\"width: 1377px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2115137870\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88181\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88184\" data-attachment-id=\"88184\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/inside-the-mind-of-jordan-mitchell/bol_0021/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?fit=1367%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1367,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BOL_0021\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-88184\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=888%2C1330\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"1330\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0021.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88184\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Jordan Mitchell</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But everything aforementioned is about the finished products — what about everything that led to them? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, the Stockton-bred artist recommends “just fucking do it.” Mitchell advised if you’re interested in dipping a toe into the music world — jump in. Immersion is the fastest way to learn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Nine times out of 10 you’re gonna suck when you start. It’s okay to be bad as shit. You develop,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Replication, according to Mitchell, is a tool for progressing in music that comes not too far after taking the initial plunge. Before “you can be yourself” in music, Mitchell explained that it’s easiest to mimic similar styles of other musicians first, then taper down and try to produce music unique to yourself. Once that’s all down, Mitchell explained, then you can commit to making your own music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it’s much easier said than done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning when he was 11 years old, the now 21-year-old Mitchell has spent the last 10 years blowing air into trumpets and strumming guitars and, most recently, bass. This time period paralleled his zeal for a variety of music genres such as rock and metal. As for hip-hop, he was interested in that, too, but surprisingly “not that much.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with his affinity for Weezer and System of a Down, Mitchell also has an ear for mariachi-style music, elements of which can be heard throughout </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t Touch My Danimals</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When chronicling his timeline of favorite genres, Mitchell somewhat alluded to a third facet of learning music: Take pride in what you make. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a musician, Mitchell placed a heavy emphasis on preserving his artistic vision. After returning to his hometown of Stockon, for example, Mitchell caught the ears of other people in the recording studio who heard him play the beat for his song “Neotokyo.” He was immediately flooded with requests to be featured on his song — all of which he declined. But why?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very psyched about features and I don’t want to feature you on this song,” Mitchell told those who asked. Mitchell explained to me that when he has an idea, he sticks to it. He also told me it’s not nice to invite yourself onto somebody else’s soundtrack — it’s rude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When producing music, Mitchell pays careful attention to his craft, treating “voices as instruments” on top of the already-present soundtrack. Mitchell’s explanation of his production game showed me just how much effort it takes to create quality soundtracks, a facet of the music industry he finds with not enough light shed on it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re getting into this time when we’re finally starting to recognize producers. You had Zaytoven, Lex Luger, TOKiMonsta, Flying Lotus — all these producers who just weren’t recognized” — and now, finally, they are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For trap music specifically, Mitchell believes the beat is “meant to shine,” while other styles, such as boom-bap, are meant to complement the lyrics. Regardless, if it wasn’t for a quality soundtrack to support the lyrics of many popular songs, Mitchell has a hunch that “rappers wouldn’t be shit without a beat.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To produce a beat, however, inspiration always helps. Mitchell finds his inspiration by treating each composition as a “very open diary.” In doing so, Mitchell’s music doubles as both a soundtrack and narration of some part of his life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve never rocked by shit I’ve never done. That’s a very big rule. Even in my most hood-rat songs, I used to do all that. That’s the whole point,” he said. “I have Tinder love. I swiped right, she swiped left — that shit hurt! These are funny things, and, you know, how do I talk about this?” he said.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88186\" style=\"width: 694px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1147752975\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"88181\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88186\" data-attachment-id=\"88186\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/inside-the-mind-of-jordan-mitchell/bol_0728/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?fit=1367%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1367,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"BOL_0728\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?fit=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?fit=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-88186\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728-684x1024.jpg?resize=684%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?resize=167%2C250&amp;ssl=1 167w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOL_0728.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-88186\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Jordan Mitchell</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two full albums and nearly ten singles on Spotify alone, it’s clear that Mitchell has many stories to tell — a few of which have garnered noticeable amounts of attention on the popular music-streaming app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With recognition comes fame, but Mitchell doesn’t want it. When asked if he has any desire to be famous in the future, Mitchell said, “It’s cool … but I don’t give a fuck about being famous.” If it happens, it happens. But he says he likes his privacy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell also hopes to one day make outrageously expensive music production software more accessible to help students have an easier time mastering it and alleviate the pain of shelling wads of cash to acquire even the most essential tools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His reason? Education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Mitchell really cares about is teaching. When he’s not behind a DJ set or an instrument, he’s behind a desk, teaching students how to transform their ideas into tangible compositions. After </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/new-hip-hop-classes-bounce-into-campus-next-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">teaching a music production class</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through the College of Creative Studies last winter quarter, Mitchell will be attending the University of Southern California next fall to earn a master’s degree in music education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kids that I taught music composition and hip-hop to — I want them to become famous. I want to sit down and be like, ‘They did that. And I’m proud of them,’ ” he said. “I’m not gonna sit here and ask for money. I just know that I did my job as an educator and happened to rap and produce my own stuff. At the end of the day, I just want to teach.”  </span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

patient care workers of the UC system, according to the press release.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The largest union both on campus and throughout the UC system, the American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 joined the initial call to strike from the Service and Patient Care Workers of the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kathryn Lybarger, president of AFSCME Local 3299 chapter, said in the press release that UC administration continuously overlooks the needs of workers at the campuses and is evasive about their outsourcing agenda. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of California has bypassed its workers at every turn, refusing to meet and confer about plans to outsource some of the last middle-class jobs in California to poverty wage contractor,” Lybarger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME Local 3299 is responsible for representing over 24,000 employees across the UC system.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union alleges that the UC has been responsible for “years of scandal,” namely income inequality and “illegal intimidation tactics.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The press release also claims that administrators at UC Davis are refusing to comply with demands to stop outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rather than arranging for UC’s current Patient Care workers to operate the new site, UC plans to eliminate those UC jobs and insists that workers should lose their employment benefits and reapply to work at the new facility,” the press release said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claire Doan, a spokesperson for the UC Office of the President, said AFSCME’s claims are unfounded and calls for attention. Doan also cited an AFSCME-led </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/afscme-calls-for-boycott-of-commencement-speakers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boycott</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of commencement speakers last month, during which the union called for workers to protest events featuring speakers such as former First Lady Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear AFSCME leaders are going to desperate lengths for attention, from sporadically announcing baseless accusations against the university to calling for a boycott of commencement speakers that squarely hurts students and their families,” Doan said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doan added that UC health and service workers receive fair compensation and benefits for their work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC already pays AFSCME patient care and service workers at or above market rates, with excellent health insurance and generous retirement benefits,” Doan said in an email to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lybarger expressed her discontent with the UC system, accusing it of siding with the most economical option, a decision that she said negatively affects union employees who risk having their jobs outsourced.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC administrators have opted for a publicly financed race to the bottom, which will come at the expense of patients, students, families, and our communities,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The May 16 strike will take place throughout the entire state on all 10 UC campuses and at all five medical campuses. University Professional and Technical Employees (UPTE) will also be present alongside AFSCME and service and patient care workers on the picket lines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s AFSCME strike headquarters will be at Storke Tower. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

A.S. is condemning these companies due to their involvement with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Both pieces of legislature, drafted by Off-Campus Senators Rafael Cornejo and Christian Ornelas, were student-sponsored by Rachel Andrews, Dylan Kupsh and A.S. President Brooke Kopel.</p>\n<p>To attain “sanctuary status,” the school needs to meet several stipulations outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>Refusing to share information with immigration enforcement agencies, investing in “faculty and staff training to support undocumented students,” protecting students and faculty from deportation, barring I.C.E. from all UCSB-owned property and blocking “campus security” from asking about an “individual’s immigration status” all contribute to the definition of “sanctuary status,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The resolution calls for all current A.S. executive offices to “release a statement in support of the Undocumented community &amp; International Community at UCSB,” and for the A.S. Executive Director to “release a statement in support of UCSB as a ‘Sanctuary Campus.’”</p>\n<p>Ornelas also cited the Senate’s history of support for undocumented students by passing a resolution that supported voter rights for undocumented residents in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“This Senate and past Senates have history of supporting the undocumented community and it would be good to continue that. Earlier this year, we passed something about voter rights for undocumented folks in I.V. and it’s good to just do something on campus,” Ornelas said.</p>\n<p>Rachel Andrews, a second-year biopsychology major, spoke about the resolution during public forum. Andrews said undocumented students often fear being “separate from us, as if they’re not your neighbor or the person you’re sitting next to in class.”</p>\n<p>The bill carries similar sentiments to the resolution, with the exception that it is tailored specifically to UCSB-invested companies, stating that “Associated Students shall not provide assistance or resources” and will prohibit any presence of these companies in A.S. “physical space[s]” without the proper documentation to enter them.</p>\n<p>Also tacked onto the bill: “ASUCSB will no longer use e-verify in its practices in order to protect the identities of its undocumented members.” E-verify is a “web-based system that allows enrolled employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States,” according to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.e-verify.gov/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>While addressing the Senate, Kopel noted that she asked UC President Janet Napolitano if she plans to make UCSB a sanctuary campus. According to Kopel, Napolitano ultimately said she would not, citing fears that it would make UCSB a target if it were to assume the label of a “Sanctuary Campus.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 3 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The case alleges that Shehadeh owes Icon <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ikes-lawsuit.pdf\">more than $42,000 in overdue rent</a>, according to public records. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reached out to both Icon’s leasing office and its legal team several times, but did not receive any comment.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a separate interview with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Shehadeh said he recently filed a countersuit against Icon, alleging that “[Icon] did some things that we didn’t appreciate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh’s countersuit alleges that Icon breached his lease agreement and committed fraud in the form of concealment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a court document sent to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Shehadeh’s attorney, the countersuit alleges that Icon hid important information following a situation involving mold on the premises, resulting in the eventual litigation currently taking place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After informing Icon in January of 2018 that he would no longer be leasing the store, “Icon negotiated with Ike’s Place to amend the lease” and remain in I.V., according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that following the repair of a faulty hose in the soda dispenser at the I.V. location, Icon, “unbeknownst to Ike’s Place… hired ATC Group Services LLC to perform a mold inspection in the neighboring property…” that same day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within that same week, ATC Group Services allegedly reported that the mold found on the premises was coming from Shehadeh’s store. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report claimed that the faulty hose was to blame for the mold but, allegedly, nobody from ATC Group Services contacted the store to inform Shehadeh there was a presence of mold on the premises. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the court document alleges that Icon had knowledge of mold on the premises prior to the faulty hose in the I.V. location’s soda dispenser. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the soda dispensary machine at the I.V. location had allegedly been inspected just “weeks prior” and the health inspector “did not find any issues with that machine,” according to the court document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Shehadeh entered negotiations between Jan. 19 of 2018 and Jul. 4 of 2018 to extend his lease with Icon, the leasing agency allegedly “did not disclose this mold report to Ike’s Place,” according to the court document: “had Ike’s Place known that Icon intended to blame mold damages in the Premises upon Ike’s place, then Ike’s Place would have been able to obtain contemporaneous evidence that it was not responsible for said damages.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shehadeh eventually decided to terminate his lease with Icon during the negotiation period but received an email in which Icon offered to “modify the amendment for the reduced gross rent,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within weeks, Shehadeh agreed to extend the lease, ending negotiations with Icon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegedly, “almost immediately” after Shehadeh signed the extended lease, Icon began inspections to “establish the presence of mold that it was already aware existed but had not disclosed to Ike’s Place,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document alleges that “Intrusive remedial work” was performed on the I.V. store following the inspection, ceasing store operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, biohazard signs were scattered throughout the store, bathrooms were closed, the kitchen was sealed off and the I.V. location was unable to make and serve sandwiches, according to the court document.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ike’s place was unable to continue to do business at the level it previously did and was accordingly unable to pay rent,” the court document states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By leaving the I.V. store uninformed about the mold, the court document alleges, Icon breached “the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it concealed material facts from Ike’s place.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. store claims, in the court document, that it was “harmed” by Icon due to its reliance on false information the leasing agency provided. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Icon’s suppression of material facts was malicious and egregious such that Icon should be liable for punitive damages,” according to the document. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court document adds that the I.V. location is seeking compensation for “punitive damages,” the cost of the suit, attorney’s fees and “general, special, compensatory, incidental, consequential and/or economic damages…”</span></p>\n<p><b>New State Street Store:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the new shop slated to open next week, Shehadeh circumvented the short hiring window by offering all current employees at the I.V location a chance to work at the new store. Furthermore, the store will be managed by one of Ike’s first-ever managers, who will bring roughly 10 years of experience to the new sandwich parlor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The State Street location is equipped with a parking lot, which allows for a full-size catering menu, decreased wait times for delivery and parking for both employees and customers, according to Shehadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Shehadeh also plans to keep the lights on late into the night, flirting with new store hours such as “10 to 10” on weekdays and “10 to midnight” on weekends. However, the hours will be adjusted according to demand, as Shehadeh finds that there’s no use in staying open if nobody wants to purchase food. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further compensate for the move, Shehadeh is excited to offer a “super student discount,” where both Santa Barbara City College and UC Santa Barbara students can tack on chips and a drink to their meal for “a buck fifty.”</span></p>\n<p>The court filings in full can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ike-Complaint-1.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

According to Fischer, students and long-term residents complained about the bench’s constant occupation, noting that it deteriorated the curb appeal of the intersection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the bench was removed and broken into “a whole bunch of pieces,” according to Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) General Manager Rodney Gould. Following the removal of the bench, Gould said the Public Works Department approached the IVRPD, asking if they would like to keep the pieces.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had an offer to receive all these slabs of stone and big boulders and we said, ‘Yes, please, we’ll take them,’” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD had the Public Works Department deliver the pieces to the Sueno Bark Park, where they plan to permanently keep the benches after they are rebuilt, according to Gould. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IVRPD plans to “reconstruct [the bench] into two, probably three separate smaller benches,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is currently no plan to have an unveiling for the new benches, Gould said the IVRPD plans to have them finished before May 18, the day of their planned “Bark Party” at the Sueno Bark Park. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On May 18, we’re having an event in the dog park called ‘Bark Party.’ We’ve got ‘Care For Paws’ out there doing free or discounted immunizations for dogs and Pet Smart’s giving away coupons and stuff. Humane Society will be there [and] Goleta Animal Pet Hospital will be giving away free coupons for services,” Gould said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then we’re going to have the best dog trick contest and the owner-pet look alike contest and musical chairs, dog version.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Following his first year, he said he  “began to continue to fall in love with our community and work closely with the I.V. CRC, the Teen Center and Community Services District.” Furthermore, Griffin also worked to help students who were displaced by </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/bluff-collapse-leaves-28-residents-without-homes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cliff collapses on Del Playa Drive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin also owns his own aerial photography company where he takes pictures for “landlords and property management services.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, a current off-campus senator, stated he is already working closely with the EVPLA office and is close friends with the current EVPLA, Jeike Meijer. Through his connections with the EVPLA and the office, Ornelas said “[Meijer is] constantly helping me learn more about her office and just the kind of work [that the] EVPLA should be doing, and how the EVPLA can be responsive to community needs.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on representing the diversity of the I.V. community, as “we are representing a diverse amount of people, both students and non-students… so it’s really important that you’re able to connect with different communities because we all share Isla Vista and it’s really pertinent to make sure that their voices are uplifted.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One question posed by Elections Board referenced Wi-Fi in I.V. Parks; despite previous efforts, the implementation of free Wi-Fi in the parks has yet to see any tangible progress. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas provided two possible solutions: build routers into park benches or take advantage of “innovative companies that utilize satellites to ping Wi-Fi to certain areas.” However, Ornelas does not guarantee he will be able to make either of these undertakings happen, noting that the term length is not favorable to larger projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin, on the other hand, believes this may be a better job for the I.V. CSD, where he has already established “creative relationships” with some of the directors, such as Father Jon Hedges. Griffin finds that the I.V. CSD would be a more appropriate place to take on the project because they have the “space for transition projects” which can be implemented over the “course of a few years,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are familiar with the I.V. CSD, the local government representing I.V. But Griffin has worked closely with current I.V. CSD directors Ethan Bertrand and Spencer Brandt in the past; Ornelas admitted that he hasn’t “been super involved in their [I.V. CSD] meetings,” but plans to be more involved in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As brought up by the Elections Board, community outreach is a cornerstone of the EVPLA position, as it is imperative to take into account the diversity of I.V. while also acting as a liaison between the community and the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, who speaks fluent Spanish, stressed the importance of having a diverse office and proposed the idea of creating a community outreach team to better connect with the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community outreach has a different meaning to Griffin, who has spent the past two years curating a series of interviews with long-term residents of I.V. called “The People of Isla Vista.” Griffin plans to continue this work, if elected, so he can devise a way to produce more inclusive programs that stretch out to those not necessarily affiliated with the school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Street lighting, a contentious issue that seems to never be completely remediated, is seen as a problem by both Ornelas and Griffin, although their solutions are not the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having had worked with the EVPLA office in the past, Griffin sees street lighting as a project for the I.V. CSD – one in which the EVPLA can help supplement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My plan would be to work with them [I.V. CSD]… to go out and find where more lights need to be implemented. And then working with the county and other organizations come up with a concrete plan to install lights in areas that are not fairly lit,” Griffin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas, on the other hand, is a fan of the ongoing efforts of the EVPLA office and its recent release of a street lighting expansion </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ornelas believes the work should remain in the office to avoid “reinventing the wheel” and restarting the project somewhere else. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas also plans to collaborate with county supervisor Joan Hartmann to “represent our voices at the county level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an increase in attendance but a decrease in arrests, the elections board asked if it may be possible to remove Deltopia’s festival ordinance in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates agree that instead of abandoning the ordinance entirely, it should be adjusted and scaled down accordingly. Furthermore, Ornelas is weary that if Deltopia becomes a sanctioned, “actual event,” there is the possible repercussion that visitors from other colleges might see the change as a potential advertisement to draw attendance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is opposed to advertising Deltopia as a real event as well, fearing that it will draw crowds from other schools who see it as an “exclusive event.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Board also asked if the candidates believe the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/alcohol-drug-program-evpla-and-gauchos-for-recovery-host-naloxone-trainings/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community naloxone trainings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> implemented in I.V. have been successful in helping residents learn how to use naloxone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both candidates are in favor of seeing the program expand more. Ornelas, who has attended a training, plans to push for Community Service Officers (CSOs) to also have naloxone on hand, as they currently do not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about their plans to fight against sexual assault, Griffin and Ornelas proposed different approaches to the situation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas believes the best approach is to listen to the needs of the community. He also cited “really close relationships with folks in students against sexual assault” and the fact that Standing Together To End Sexual Assault (STESA), a college advocate program for sexual assault survivors, recently approached the I.V CSD for funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin plans to work directly with the I.V. CSD to implement more Green Dot trainings, which help educate students on sexual assault and violence. On top of that, Griffin also hopes to bring the Blue Light system to I.V., which he believes will make the community feel safer at night and speed up police response times by having numerous emergency alarms around I.V. that will alert police if activated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last on the list of questions was the subject of food insecurity and its disproportionate effect on marginalized students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ornelas placed a heavy emphasis on strengthening the services of the A.S. Food Bank and CalFresh. As a vice chair on A.S. Finance and Business, Orneals stated that “there’s honestly a lot of room for improvement in how money can be used more efficiently. So really making sure that we’re reevaluating the budget and allocating that to programs that people really need.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Griffin is in favor of expanding the services of the A.S. Food Bank because he feels “not everybody can access it or not everybody knows about it, who is food insecure.” He would also like to work with local grocery stores to create a food bank that gives nearly-expired food for free to students.</span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

Abdullahi said she would like to give financial aid to working students who live in university-owned off-campus housing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I want to try to see if I can work something out to get students who work above a certain amount of hours to get financial assistance,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi is also a proponent of strengthening the current bus services, as she finds that both freshmen living in the Santa Catalina Residence Halls and other students living in university-owned off-campus housing often have to “put in a little more effort to come to school on time.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s a huge inconvenience even when you live a mile away from campus,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi is also in favor of working with transfer senators, as she claims their constituents often overlap because many transfer students seek residence through university-owned off-campus housing as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve already been working with the current transfer senator that’s running… to do my job effectively, I will also have to be in close contact with people who are also representing the same groups of people that I’m representing,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi said the biggest issue with university-owned off-campus housing is the distance from campus, stating that the extended time it takes to campus is an inconvenience to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parking problems, an issue not necessarily specific to university-owned off-campus housing, was also a point of conversation during the forum. Abdullahi said she believes residents who live the farthest from campus should receive parking priority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tackle rising student fees, Abdullahi suggested “looking into the system to see where money is allocated” in order to reallocate funds to help combat the price hike. However, Abdullahi admitted that she is unfamiliar with the system but plans to become more familiar with it in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the topic of accessibility, specifically between the student body and A.S., Abdullahi would like to bridge the gap by personally approaching students to understand their needs. Furthermore, she would like to augment the current level of representation of university-owned off-campus housing students by moving events that would typically occur on campus to off campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing what students need and asking them personally is something that I intend to do,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abdullahi added that she would have no problem holding meetings with students living in university-owned off-campus housing to help inform them of A.S. resources. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When discussing her background, Abdullahi noted that being a woman of color and a first generation student has allowed her to “walk through campus with a few different lenses,” which she believes will ultimately motivate her to be more “sympathetic” to the needs of students. As a Resident Assistant, Abdullahi said her immersion in different student communities has also helped broaden her horizons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Once you help everybody at the bottom, everybody else gets helped out as a result,” she said. </span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

statement expressed a need for change through a demand for “Nazi symbols” to be considered a terrorist act.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several sociology, political science, global studies and environmental studies graduate students at UC Santa Barbara released a statement on April 4 regarding an incident of anti-Semitism that took place two days prior, labeling the incident as a “terrorist act.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement alleges that on the morning of April 2, a man was seen walking “the hallways of the UCSB Sociology department wearing a ‘Waffen SS’ (Nazi death squad) t-shirt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement was contacted immediately after the individual was seen by a graduate student who reported the individual walking through the building, according to the statement. The statement also noted that department staff and campus security were made aware of the incident around the same time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man was not apprehended and disappeared before law enforcement arrived, according to the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement was signed by Marisa D. Salinas, Zachary King, Ben Manski, Oscar Soto, David Feldman, William Haywood Carey, Ryan J. Fisher, Shawn Van Valkenburgh, Amanda Pinheiro, Sarah Manski, Andrew Johnson, Elliott Finn and Mariah Brennan Clegg.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada said the university is currently “aware of reports of someone wearing the ‘Waffen SS’ logo” and that an investigation followed the initial report, although no one was apprehended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another incident where anti-semitic flyers were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-07/a-s-senate-condemns-anti-semitism-in-response-to-anti-semitic-fliers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “on cars and buildings surrounding the residences of Jewish students in Isla Vista” occurred only two days earlier, according to the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Associated Students (A.S.) Senate released a formal statement regarding the flyers, denouncing it as “extremely derogatory” and “obscenely misrepresentative of Jewish people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We call upon the UCSB student body to actively stand in solidarity with our Jewish community by spreading awareness and education about anti-Semitism, and to quickly report any concering behavior,” the A.S. statement read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students echoed the sentiments of the statement published by A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graduate students’ statement encouraged “immediate preventative action,” labeling such incidents as part of “an ever-growing tide of terrorist threats against students, staff, and faculty both here and at campuses across the United States.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement expressed a need for change through a demand for “Nazi symbols” to be considered a terrorist act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We insist that campus and union officials publicly recognize that the act of (uncritically) displaying Nazi symbols is a terrorist act,” the statement added. “Posting violent threats to Jews is racial terrorism that must not be tolerated anywhere, including our campus community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement acknowledged that campus security and department personnel have previously told students to report any “potentially threatening behaviors,” but noted that “there has yet to be any wide announcement to the campus community of the calculated dissemination of Nazi materials or of the sighting of Nazi apparel on campus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the statement justified its call for action, claiming that “such a warning and a call for action is necessary not only because students, staff, and faculty already vulnerable to violence have a right to know about potential threats… but more so because it is a certainty that someone in the broader community knows the person or persons making these terrorist threats.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement said there should be an institutional response centered on the well being and safety of UCSB students and employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An institutional response would have “the potential to prevent or at least minimize the severity of any future attack,” according to the statement. </span></p>\n<p>The statement in full can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Grad-Letter-to-UCSB-Officials-2.7.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Grad-Letter-to-UCSB-Officials-2.7.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Sciences Librarian representing UCSB at the bargaining table, said in an interview with the <i>Nexus.</i></p>\n<p>“We worked diligently to come up with language that was equitable and we were working around issues that were pre-existing and known to the union because of grievances that had been filed relating to our current contract and now former contracts.”</p>\n<p>One of these grievances revolved around salaries.</p>\n<p>LaBonte said that many librarians felt their salaries from UCSB were inadequate when considering the high cost of living in Santa Barbara. LaBonte even thinks that some librarian job applicants ruled out UCSB as a viable option because of this inadequacy.</p>\n<p>“We’d hear feedback from people that would say, ‘well, I didn’t realize what the cost of living was like,’” said LaBonte, who took a 22% pay cut after coming to UCSB from her previous position as a librarian at California State University Channel Islands.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to attract people just because of the location, which is beautiful and amazing,” she added. “But if you don’t have the salaries to match it, people either won’t come or they won’t stick around for long.”</p>\n<p>To remedy this situation, the union reached a deal with UC that would guarantee an “annual increases for all represented librarians, with a total cumulative benefit of approximately 22-26% over five years,” according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Temporary librarians, another debated grievance, played a large role throughout the contract negotiations.</p>\n<p>Temporary librarians are librarians who are only hired to work a set duration of time at their respective place of employment.</p>\n<p>Coinciding with an already high employee turnover, LaBonte said that she and other library representatives worked with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) to improve the conditions of temporary librarians.</p>\n<p>Although the situation with temporary librarians was not completely resolved, the union, along with input from UCOP, was able to partially amend their new contract to prevent future abuses from UC libraries, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>“We tried our best to get some wording in for the issue with temporary librarians. UC occasionally hires temporary librarians and the contract says that it’s not supposed to be for permanent work,” LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>“When that person leaves, who is going to fill in the gap?” LaBonte raised about the issue.</p>\n<p>When a temporary librarian leaves, another one is hired to replace them. This process oftentimes repeats itself multiple times, depleting the library of resources used to rehire and train new librarians, LaBonte added.</p>\n<p>Similar to temporary librarians, academic freedom among UC librarians saw improvement, but was ultimately left out of the new contract. Academic freedom, according to the <a href=\"https://www.aft.org/position/academic-freedom\">union’s website</a>, “is based on the idea that the free exchange of ideas on campus is essential to good education.”</p>\n<p>After introducing academic freedom during the bargaining process, LaBonte said that UC immediately dismissed it, reasoning that academic freedom would not be a “good fit” in the contract.</p>\n<p>“That news rippled far and wide. I was hearing from colleagues all over the country that they had heard what was going on here. So that was also some bad publicity,” she said.</p>\n<p>Although academic freedom was left unincorporated in the new contract, Labonte claims that she and fellow union representatives reached a deal with academic freedom.</p>\n<p>“We did get [UC] to verbally agree that they would be incorporating the academic freedom policy protections,” she said, emphasizing that the inclusion of a verbal agreement was paramount, as “basically all of the academics on campus did not have academic freedom protection” until this new policy takes effect.</p>\n<p>However, in order for the academic freedom policy to go into action, it will still have to undergo a 90 day system-wide review, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Another component of the new contract was professional development. Although funding for librarians at UCSB is distributed on a per-capita (campus) basis, this was not a uniform practice, according to LaBonte. Other UC libraries distribute money on a first come, first serve basis, which she deems is an unfair practice to UC librarians.</p>\n<p>With the new contract, however, all UC libraries will operate on a per-capita basis, ensuring a fair and equal amount of funding is available to each library.</p>\n<p>LaBonte stressed the importance of this new practice, adding that this funding allows librarians “to go and present at conferences and participate with professional organizations.”</p>\n<p>Other small victories were piled into the contract as well, LaBonte said.</p>\n<p>For example, if a librarian falls ill during a vacation, they can opt to use sick leave instead of their vacation time. Also, librarians are now guaranteed up to thirty days of sick leave which can be used for “baby bonding”, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, some demands did not get any ink in this cycle’s contract, and librarians will have to wait until the next round of contract negotiations for further demands to be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>Sabbaticals and eligibility for housing assistance programs, for example, were left unsupported by the new contract, as well as “grievability for denials of flexible work arrangements,” according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>Overall, the union deemed this contract a success, highlighted by a post on their website: “This is not an April Fools joke! UCOP has been notified; the new MOU is officially in effect.”</p>\n<p>LaBonte emulated a similar sentiment, notably her enthusiasm for an overwhelming number of wins in this cycle of negotiations.</p>\n<p>When asked why she wanted to represent UCSB at the bargaining table, LaBonte’s answer was simple.</p>\n<p>“I got my bachelor’s degree here in geography in 1999. So I’ve been working in and out of this library since 1994. I love UCSB. I’m a lifelong Gaucho,” she said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

AFSCME has gone on strike three times during this period, aiming to get better pay and retirement benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UPTE initiated the call for Wednesday’s strike; AFSCME, as well as several United Automobile Workers 5810 (UAW) members, later joined in solidarity and support of their shared interests regarding the result of UPTE’s ongoing contract negotiations with the University of California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal is to have the university recognize how important it is to us, where we’ll take a day without pay to try and get these fair wages and maintain our healthcare plan,” said Michael Holford, a member of UPTE who also works in UCSB’s Communication Services department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the strike, union workers made beelines around campus – from Henley Gate to Cheadle Hall – in a demand for better treatment by the UC.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babe Gonzalez, a representative for AFSCME 3229 and a Student Health employee, said the UC’s current offer to employees does not accommodate workers’ needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC is wanting to give us a lump sum of money in exchange for job security, in exchange for outsourcing jobs,” Gonzalez said, noting the UC’s lack of attention to what she believes union workers really need: “We need our job to continue. We don’t need a lump sum of money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another concern voiced through the microphones involved livable wages. Jarrod Coldron, an AFSCME representative, former UCSB student and present-day groundskeeper at the university, said he is fearful that the cost of living in Isla Vista might force him out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really like my job here, but it’s really expensive to live in Isla Vista, and if I don’t have a good contract, I won’t be able to afford to live here as long as I want to,” Coldron said. “I’m just trying to keep this affordable for me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the only groundskeeper currently residing in I.V., Coldron explained that his coworkers often commute from other areas in the county to work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think I’m the only groundskeeper on campus that lives in l.V. Everybody else is in Lompoc or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carpentaria. A lot of people live far away and bus in,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, according to UCOP representative Claire Doan, the UC finds that UPTE is asking too much from the institution and has been unreasonable with their demands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are disappointed with UPTE leadership, demanding unreasonable double-digit raises (16 to 22 percent over the proposed terms of the agreement) that are far beyond those given to other UC employees. Since negotiations began in 2017, our offers have been fair and substantial, guaranteeing competitive wage increases and excellent benefits,” Doan said in an email with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Meanwhile, UPTE leaders have neither presented a realistic counteroffer, nor have they let their members vote on UC’s proposals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez said she believes the UC’s resistance to forming a better contract is derived from a poor understanding of the situation. At a university, Gonzalez said that a vital function of the workplace is “to make sure that they are respectful of their members,” which includes students at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC doesn’t seem to realize how important we are. We are the first contact when a student comes to the Health Center, when they’re having someone clean their dorms … They don’t go to the offices to see people. They don’t know who they are, they know who we are, and they know that we care,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gary Colmenar, a librarian at UCSB, offered a similar sentiment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s really important for us to tell the administration that we’re the people who actually work and run the university,” Colmenar said, who also noted a dry spell in contracts for the library’s worker union, University of California American Federation of Teachers (UC-AFT), which has dragged on for over six months.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_86998\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/labor-strike_devin-ralston_online-7/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-86998\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86998\" data-attachment-id=\"86998\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/labor-strike_devin-ralston_online-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Labor Strike_Devin Ralston_ONLINE (7)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86998\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Labor-Strike_Devin-Ralston_ONLINE-7.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-86998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Devin Ralston / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the day, waves of union employees marched through campus with chants, aiming to not only build energy, but also to voice their complaints.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At noon, multiple speakers spoke at a rally for the workers, all of whom funneled the sentiments of those chants into the messages of their speeches.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Oscar Soto, a graduate student at UCSB, took the stage, he turned the microphone to the crowd and began to ask them questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the question: “How many of you are undergrads?” many students raised their hands. A substantial, but fewer, number of palms raised in the air when Soto asked how many </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">workers were graduate students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But zero hands broke the plane when he asked if anyone was a professor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What does this tell you about the university?” Soto asked in response to his own questions. “What does it tell you about the importance of what they [UC] put in front of the table?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez finds that the lack of support from upper-level employees at the UC, such as professors and administrators, has led to a revolving door of frustration for many campus employees. As a result, workers such as Gonzalez say they can feel trapped in a web of negotiations, oftentimes going on strike multiple times in an attempt to bargain with the university.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no empathy, no feelings. It just seems like all of the UC Regents have all their retirement cut out, they have their pensions, they have their raises, and they do a lot of work, but they have to realize that we’re valuable,” Gonzalez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re family, we’re family with students, and they don’t have that connection like we do, and if they did, they’d really appreciate helping down the line.”</span></p>\n<p>Further photos of the strike can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-21/in-photos-afscme-utpe-strike/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [March 23, 2:31 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
