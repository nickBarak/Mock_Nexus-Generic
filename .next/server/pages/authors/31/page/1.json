Shortly after the assault, Roe filed a police report with the Santa Barbara Police Department according to the motion, as well as a Title IX complaint one year later. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In August 2017, the Title IX office found Doe responsible for sexually assaulting Roe in 2015 and in violation of the UC’s sexual misconduct policies, according to the motion. In November 2017, the university sanctioned Doe with a three-year suspension and ruled he would be allowed to return in November 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe subsequently filed his petition to vacate the Title IX findings in January 2018, according to the motion. When he filed his petition to vacate the Title IX office’s findings in 2018, which was heard by the superior court, the court approved his petition and dismissed the findings in April 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the latest motion filed on June 9, Adams argues that the superior court only heard evidence from John Doe and the university when Doe filed his petition, but not from Roe or Roe’s lawyers. In addition, Roe had no knowledge that her case had been reopened nor that the superior court had ruled to vacate the Title IX office’s findings, according to Adams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”This is really not about Jane Roe. This is about all of the survivors out there who are completely left out of this process,” she added. “I’ve actually never heard of a situation in which they have included and notified the survivor.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adams said this case speaks to the larger issue of due process and the misrepresentation of survivors in Title IX cases, of which there have been at least </span><a href=\"https://www.titleixforall.com/milestone-600-title-ix-due-process-lawsuits-in-behalf-of-accused-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">600 lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed on behalf of accused students in attempts to overturn their respective schools’ findings of sexual assault. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can absolutely say that the reason victims are left out of these cases is because the assailant or the accused person does not include them in the lawsuit,” Adams said. “So it is quite ironic to me that respondents in these cases are crying out for due process and then simultaneously robbing survivors, like our client, of the same in these cases.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roe’s motion is set to be heard in July, she said, but the other parties, Doe and the university, have a chance to respond to the motion before it is heard by a judge. Adams said she expects Doe to oppose the motion but is unsure if the university will follow suit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A big question will be whether the school will oppose our motion,” Adams said. “We would hope that the school would agree with us, that all students who are involved in these cases are entitled to notice of these filings.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university declined to comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Hathaway, who represents Doe, did not respond to multiple requests for comment but provided to the Daily Nexus a copy of Doe’s opposition to motion to vacate, which was filed on June 18 in response to Doe’s previous motion to vacate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opposition to motion to vacate alleges that the UC Regents “failed to provide a Title IX process that complied with California law” and argues that because neither Doe nor Roe are currently UCSB students, the matter is “moot” and does not require anymore administrative proceedings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In July’s hearing, the judge will decide whether or not to grant Roe’s motion, which could reverse the superior court’s previous decision to vacate the Title IX findings, Adams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the judge doesn’t motion to vacate, Doe’s petition will stand and he would remain absolved from the Title IX findings. But if the judge does motion to vacate, Doe’s petition would be void and the original Title IX findings against Doe would stand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All parties — Doe, Roe and UCSB — will have the chance to appeal the judge’s upcoming July decision. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result of any motion to appeal, from either party, has the potential to set legal precedent; the decision could determine how future cases define “real parties in interests,” which is a </span><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/real_party_in_interest\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">term</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used to describe a person or entity who will be impacted by the outcome of legal action even if they are not explicitly defined as a party in the case, Adams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should the court of appeals rule “that all survivors are real parties in interests who are entitled to notice of petition filings” and legal action, a new precedent could be set, which would mandate that all survivors in Title IX cases be included in future cases, Adams said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had Roe been included as a real party in interest, Roe would have been notified when Doe filed his petition and when the court vacated the Title IX findings, Adams said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a statement to the Nexus, Roe described how she felt excluded from the legal proceedings that voided the responsibility of sexual assault from her assaliant and emphasized the importance of changing the legal landscape to uplift — and include — the survivors’ voices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Being excluded from the court’s legal proceedings made me feel like my voice had been completely taken away. It felt like the court didn’t care about my experience, and was just handing over the power and narrative of my story to my attacker,” Roe said. “I had no way to defend myself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s been about 5 years since my assault, and it feels ridiculous that I’m still fighting for my voice to be heard. But it’s important for me to know that I am also fighting for the rights of other survivors as well,” she said. “That’s why I want my story to make a difference.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

For those who are stuck in quarantine, the struggle of food shopping only magnifies, Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faced with the puzzle of supplying community members with food while also keeping them safe amidst a pandemic, Cohen said the co-op sidestepped potential health hazards by </span><a href=\"https://islavistafoodcoop.storebyweb.com/s/1000-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doing the shopping</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for its customers through an online order system while working with food distributors to keep products on the shelves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She described the last few months of keeping the co-op afloat as “a profound journey of dismantling, reestablishing, recalibrating, reinculturating, repurposing and recentering.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As much as Costco might’ve been easy or useful to deal with or Sprouts was a resource before, they’re not resources now. Corporate grocery could not help UCSB in [its] moment of need,” she continued. “I bet you don’t realize the power of having a community grocer right in your back pocket.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest advantages of running the co-op, as opposed to a corporate grocery store, is its lack of a corporate hierarchy, Cohen explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The uniqueness of being a small business at this time is very powerful,” she said, referring to the co-op’s flexibility in rolling out new rules and policies instantly without the need for higher-up approval. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-op leveraged this advantage in March, when out-of-towners flocked to the store after wiping clean the nearby Costco and Sprouts, Cohen said. She immediately implemented mask-wearing policies and purchase limits to keep a lid on the panic buying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of a sudden, the co-op was descended upon by non-students who are buying hundreds of dollars worth of stuff at one time when we’re used to, like, a $10, $15 shopping basket,” Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Overnight, the co-op was discovered as this off-the-beaten-path treasure as all these supermarkets have these crazy lines and people are freaking out, and then suddenly people are shopping at the co-op,” she explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the panic buying, Cohen said the loss of a third of her workforce — the part-time </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-17/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-ucsb-students-grapple-with-i-v-leases-after-university-strongly-recommends-moving-home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students who left I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ride out the pandemic at home — was another symptom of the pandemic’s toll on the co-op. But her remaining staff, despite being “worked to the bone,” stepped up to meet the demand, she said; at its peak, sales at the co-op were up nearly 70%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To offset the burden of working during the pandemic, Cohen said the co-op has been paying all employees hazard pay — including $2-per-hour raises and cash bonuses — since March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, the co-op’s new safety protocols include new rules for sick leave, a mask-wearing policy for workers and customers, cleaning guidelines and performing administrative work remotely, Cohen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cohen also said she is grateful for the </span><a href=\"https://davisfood.coop/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis Food Co-op</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the I.V. Food co-op’s sister store up north, for sharing its pandemic response plan and giving the co-op an adaptable blueprint for future plans and protocols, and for Churchill, whose sanitizer orders sounded the alarm about the necessity of preparing the co-op for the pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cohen said these efforts provided an added layer of security to the store by making customers and workers feel safe while inside the food co-op. But when it comes to the food supply chain, which is largely out of the hands of the co-op, some uncertainty still looms, according to Steve Snyder, the I.V. Food Co-op’s merchandising manager. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line, he said, is that the “food supply chain was robust until people lost their minds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the third week of March, the panic buying was so intense that customers were buying items straight off the delivery truck before they even hit the shelves, Snyder said. This briefly forced the co-op to put in orders to its food distributors that were twice its normal size, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So the panic buying, the hoarding, the desperate desire to get it before your neighbor gets it — that’s what broke the food supply chain. When [they] recommended that people remain calm, that is what we all should have done,” Snyder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There would be toilet paper on shelves if every person in North America, who could get four cases of 96-count toilet paper, didn’t go out and do that and build a fort in their garage,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snyder said there are currently a variety of holes in Southern California’s food supply chain, which is one of the largest and most impacted grocery regions in the U.S. Some of these gaps are reflected directly on the co-op’s shelves, where products such as rice, pasta, soup, toilet paper, bottled water and frozen fruits are either slowly returning in quantity or still out of stock. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the food co-op is connected directly to growers around the state, Snyder said the quantity of some items, mainly produce, is not a concern. But when it comes to sourcing products from manufacturers and vendors — adding more layers to the supply chain — availability becomes more of an issue, Snyder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some warehouses used by </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-06-09/coronavirus-pandemic-food-supply\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manufacturers and vendors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to store products have bled dry from panic buying, Snyder said. This means that “they’ve either sold through everything and they have to wait for the 2020 harvest to begin reproducing for staples … or they haven’t sold through everything but they’re allotting shipments to specific warehouses to make sure that everybody gets a chance,” he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judging from his experiences during the coronavirus pandemic, Snyder said he’d down boil what he learned into two takeaways for the future: “Try to figure out how to not get caught off guard” and “put quantity limits in place sooner.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just wish that people would recognize that everyone should have access to food. And you’re not helping anyone, including yourself, if you’re buying a year’s or more supply of stuff,” he said. “That’s going to sit in your garage and eventually go stale, and then you’re going to send it to the landfill.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Cohen, the pandemic may have been full of learning experiences, but it was also a catalyst for growth. She recalled being wary of starting Co-op Curbside, the co-op’s grocery delivery service, but grew to appreciate the convenience — and necessity — of having such a service after seeing how it unified community members during a time of need. Now, she says, the co-op has immortalized the service and she can’t see the store without it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I always had said, ‘I think doing home delivery is ridiculous. The co-op is place-based and people need to come to the store; it’s about the experience,’” she said. “And, of course, I’ve been proven wrong.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same can also be said for hazard pay, Cohen said. Now, $15 per hour is the new normal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back at the strenuous months of March, April and May, Cohen said the pandemic has been a bumpy road for the co-op, in part because the store lost some of its identity in the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a place that prides itself on helping customers “feel safe and be seen,” Cohen said closing down the outdoor patio, canceling upcoming workshops and rolling out safety protocols made it all the more difficult to do that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But through it all, the community response has been “incredible,” Cohen said, pointing to moments of appreciation from new and long-term customers who saw the value in the co-op’s grocery delivery service and cleaning protocols and found comfort knowing that there would always be food on the shelves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for a small business with a generational stake in I.V. and a community of fervent supporters, Cohen is confident that the “new normal” will make the co-op stronger than ever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you haven’t lived and loved Isla Vista and gone through your part of your life here, you will never know the magnitude of this community,” she said. “One of Isla Vista’s most magnificent attributes is that it is a community that is resilient and inspired. And every time we turn to the next calendar cycle, it’s a blank canvas — an opportunity for the next generation to show that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For us to get to be a part of this iteration of Isla Vista and feel like we’re actually doing work that the community is benefiting from — to me, there’s nothing better,” she said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-94880\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar, titled “The Fire This Time: Race at Boiling Point,” featured a panel of five prominent speakers. </span>Courtesy<em> of UCHRI</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar, titled “The Fire This Time: Race at Boiling Point,” featured prominent speakers such as Angela Davis, a professor emerita at UC Santa Cruz and a renowned political activist; Herman Gray, a professor emeritus at UC Santa Cruz; Gaye Theresa Johnson, a professor of African American studies at UC Los Angeles; Robin D. G. Kelley, a professor of African American studies and American history at UC Los Angeles; and Josh Kun, a professor of communication and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The webinar began with a discussion about the meaning of the phrase “I can’t breathe,” a phrase associated with the Black Lives Matter movement and some of the last words from </span><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/i-cant-breathe-george-floyds-words-reverberate-oppression\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">George Floyd</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/10/23/559498678/i-can-t-breathe-explores-life-and-death-at-the-hands-of-police\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eric Garner</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, two Black men who were both killed by white police officers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gray highlighted the phrase’s dual meaning, both as a symbol of environmental racism experienced by Black people and the product of illegal choke holds used by law enforcement to detain Black people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think about breath in terms of environment and polluted air and the environmental degradation that Black and brown people have to live through,” Gray said. “Breathe and breathing as the terms to understand the devastating health impact of the pandemic of COVID-19, which disproportionately attacks Black and brown people, particularly around respiratory systems in urban populations and older populations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Breath also expresses the constricted air available to Black men, women and children at the hands of police, through illegal tactics like choke holds and knees to the neck,” he continued. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Breath is constricted because of the stresses and strains that parents, grandparents, partners, whose daily life is often relegated to overcrowded and under resourced conditions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson discussed the role of the protests in inciting change and how the ongoing struggle for equality is representative of “a different kind of calculus of human work.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All of the things that are happening right now, while they are incredibly concerning, they are also, as we all know, incredibly hopeful and powerful,” Johnson continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation shifted from domestic movements to international ones, Davis discussed the global response to police brutality and racial inequality. She highlighted her experiences with academics and activists from the Brazilian state of Amazonas, which she said suffers from not only discrimination and violence from the police, but also an extreme militarization of its police. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The nation state [in America], as we know it, is no longer possible, and so a broad international perspective not only helps us to imagine solidarity but to think about what kind of future we want,” Davis said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we say ‘abolish prisons,’ when we say ‘abolish the police,’ we are thinking about a future in which we will have moved beyond the bourgeois capitalist notion of the nation state,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Davis, Kelley revisited the development of the nation state and its efforts to facilitate racial inequality as a “repressive arm” that asserts control through “police power [and] military power,” he said, especially during times of unrest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In responding to Davis’ comments about dismantling the nation state, Kelley said Davis is “laying out a vision of internationalism, which is in some ways the beginnings of a global vision that focuses on the conditions of the least of us, that creates the conditions of life for working people around the globe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things about this moment we’re in now is that it is deeply international, it’s deeply multiracial, it is broad, and … it builds on a decade of struggles that Black Lives Matter, in particular, has laid out,” he continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Kelley, Johnson spoke about how the rise of authoritarianism and policing in America speaks to the fragility of white supremacy, and how those who support the nation state are reinforcing the “master narrative,” which Johnson described as the belief that the inequalities Americans face are unique to this country. That, however, is untrue, Johnson said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even when you hear people who are liberals talk about, ‘Oh I can’t believe this is happening in our country and everybody is hurting, I can’t believe we’re in these times.’ These times have always been here,” Johnson said. “The only thing that has changed, is again, we’ve had enough.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis added that unlike past movements, especially those that predate the digital era of citizen journalism — the phenomenon in which ordinary bystanders or witnesses to an event can record and share those events through social media — the public reaction to the death of George Floyd has been met with </span><a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/george-floyd-protests-world-racism/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intense and widespread emotion.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was something about the witnessing of George Floyd’s last breaths that has become a collective phenomenon. We’ve all been transformed because we’ve all seen the last nine minutes of this brother’s life,” Davis said. “That emotional connection has been very much lacking in our movements prior to the more recent era.”    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis also said that the feminist intersection of organizing movements for Black lives often goes unrecognized, although the </span><a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/our-co-founders/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Lives Matter movement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, along with many others, was founded and run by Black women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelley applauded the efforts of Black women in organizing demonstrations — citing one that took place just outside his house on Beverly Boulevard. “All they have is a face mask,” he said, highlighting the fact that many Black female activists are risking their lives to organize demonstrations in the wake of the coronavirus, which </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-coronavirus-racial-disparities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">disproportionately affects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Black people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to leading movements, Kelley said some people still subscribe to the ideology that “what the movement needs is the male leader.” Although people still hold onto that idea, he said, “I think it’s dying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conversation drew to a close, Kun spoke to the momentum of the ongoing worldwide movements for Black lives and the unprecedented intensity by which society is demanding change. He warned, however, that this intensity will die down, but that it’s imperative to avoid compressing “longitudinal” movements — those that span months or years — into a week of protests, which can damage their longevity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis is impressed with the progress already made by movements for Black lives, and “the extent to which notions of systemic racism, structural racism, institutional racism [have] thoroughly permeated the mainstream.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an extremely important moment because [the] work that we’ve been doing for such a long time … seems to be reaching a kind of fruition,” she said. “But I’m especially interested in Black Lives Matter — the negative responses that first occurred when the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ emerged in the context of the Ferguson protests.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So many people were saying, ‘Shouldn’t all lives matter?’ But I think now people are beginning to get it,” she said. “And I’ve seen a lot of signs that say ‘All lives will not matter until Black lives matter.’”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the UC Office of the President, the UC has invested $38 million into the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) through donations from the </span><a href=\"https://www.moore.org/home\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (GBMF) and another $30 million directly from its own funds in the past six years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The financial report was obtained through a California Public Records Act from the campus activist organization Mauna Kea Protectors at UC Berkeley in early May and details the UC’s history of contributions to TMT from October 2014 to February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But until recently, public knowledge surrounding the UC’s use of its own funds for the roughly </span><a href=\"https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2020/03/17/hawaii-news/thirty-meter-telescope-cost-estimate-increases-to-2-4b/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$2.4 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> telescope project has been largely speculative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to an </span><a href=\"http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/mar14/f4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">action item</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the March 2014 Board of Regents meeting, the UC and Caltech agreed to split a $250 million pledge from GBMF and to jointly raise an additional $100 million from their own funds. The UC said in the action item that it planned to raise its half of the share — $50 million — through “philanthropic support.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But funding directly from the UC has come from a variety of other sources, including reallocated funding from another observatory project, the UC’s department of Research and Graduate Studies and “systemwide funds,” which are used “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for an array of purposes including teaching and research,” Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the UC, said in an email to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student fees, however, are not included in the UC’s contributions to TMT, according to UC Spokesperson Claire Doan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC had contributed to TMT solely through grants from GBMF from October 2014 until October 2016, when it made a $10 million contribution to TMT using its own funds, according to the financial report. The $10 million contribution was one of the largest donations listed on the financial report, second to a $13,883,525 contribution made that same month from GBMF grant funding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, the UC has continued to make contributions with its own funds in varying amounts — some as small as $126 in September 2017 and others as large as $5 million, which it paid out four separate times in June 2018, November 2018, August 2019 and February 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The timing of the UC’s February 2020 contribution to TMT also came less than a month after UC Board of Regents Chair John Pérez said at the Board’s January meeting that he intended to facilitate a discussion about the UC’s involvement with the project, The Daily Californian </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2020/05/22/uc-invests-68m-into-thirty-meter-telescope-on-maunakea/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the activist organization Uprooted &amp; Rising said at a </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/uprootedandrising/videos/920585268346863/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press conference</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 21 that the UC has not engaged in any discussions surrounding its involvement in the project. Many students spoke at a public forum during the May 21 Board of Regents virtual Zoom meeting, asking the Regents to divest from TMT and echoing the demands of an </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the UC Student Association in September 2019 calling on the UC to cut financial ties with the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite ongoing friction from UC students who contest TMT’s development on Native Hawaiian land, the UC maintains that it is “deeply committed” to respecting the environment and culture surrounding Mauna Kea and has collaborated with the Hawaiian community “to address a range of cultural, environmental, educational and economic issues,” Holbrook wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jeike Meijer, a fourth-year global studies and feminist studies double major and an organizer for the Mauna Kea Protectors at UC Santa Barbara, “this investment is making a very big statement about [the UC’s] lack of support for Indigenous and Hawaiian students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meijer said many students are frustrated with the UC because they feel that their opposition to TMT has gone ignored and that the UC’s opacity with the project is a disservice to students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the UC Board of Regents virtual meeting from May 19-21, Meijer said she and Terrill James Kaneali‘i Williams, an Indigeneous Hawaiian graduate student from UC Riverside, were promised an opportunity to speak during public forum; after speaking first, Meijer said the Board of Regents did not call on Kaneali‘i Williams to speak, even though “they promised two days in a row to call [on] him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s so frustrating because there’s no other way for him to get to talk to the board because it’s all virtual now. And it felt like they were silencing him,” Meijer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That was really frustrating for me because I’m Indigenous, but I’m not Hawaiian. And we were banking on having the Hawaiian voice be there,” she added. “So it’s really challenging with these virtual Board of Regents meetings because they can choose to just not call [on] people and that seems to be what they’ve done.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At UCSB, students have voiced their concerns regarding TMT in a variety of ways, including a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December with Native Hawaiian activists, </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/students-condemn-uc-and-chancellor-yangs-involvement-in-thirty-meter-telescope-express-support-for-native-hawaiians/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">petitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to condemn the university’s involvement and meetings with Chancellor Henry T. Yang, who currently chairs TMT’s board of governors. Despite his title, Yang maintains that his role in TMT </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is miniscule. </span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to these concerns, Mejier is also worried about the environmental aspects of TMT. Mauna Kea is considered sacred in Native Hawaiian culture and is home to multiple endangered </span><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/ENDANGERED/bulletin/2002/03-06/22-23.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wildlife species</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that cannot be found anywhere else on earth, she said. Should TMT continue building the telescope, it may put Mauna Kea’s unique ecosystems at risk, she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kealoha Pisciotta, </span><a href=\"http://kahea.org/blog/mk-vignette-kealoha-pisciotta\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">founder</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the protest group Mauna Kea Anaina Hou, said during the Uprooted &amp; Rising press conference in May that Native Hawaiians have been pleading to Gordon and Betty Moore for years to stand with them to protect Mauna Kea. Over a decade since TMT broke ground, she said, their calls have still been unanswered and the Native Hawaiian elders — known as kupunas — are still on the frontlines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The only way to do this project is they’re going to have to hurt people,” Pisciotta said, “because the kupunas are willing to die.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Her Senate resolution, which is positional and only takes a stance on the issue, urges the university to “bear the increased financial consequences of a situation that is essentially out of their control.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution, this could come in the shape of university-subsidized housing, where students are exempted from paying any potential inflations in room and board prices if their housing rates increase as a result of room availability changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe UCSB’s Housing department should not inflate room and board prices in an effort to make up for any lost revenue from students who decide not to, or are unable to, live on-campus during a possible [sic] hybrid/online course period,” the resolution continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gurleen Pabla, a first-year political science major and on-campus senator who seconded the resolution, said she is concerned that students of color, low-income students and first-generation students will be “disproportionately disadvantaged” if the only options for on-campus housing are singles or doubles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a lot of students that otherwise wouldn’t have to take out as many loans or spend as much time also doing a job just to maintain a single or a double when they could have comfortably, or at least not been so concerned, with living in a triple or quad,” Pabla said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s unfair to students that just want to have a fun college life and that are now having to deal with this concern of a price [for a single or double room],” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://www.housing.ucsb.edu/rates\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s housing website,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the 2019-20 rate of a triple room with fourteen meals a week is $15,767 per year. The rate of a double room with 14 meals a week is $17,767, $2,000 more than the triple, and the rate of a single room with 14 meals a week is $19,267, $3,500 more per year than the triple room. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the precarity of fall quarter in mind, De Ramon said “it’s really important that the university, and every department within the university, always puts students and the needs of students before any sort of profit or revenue.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Sanders said he’s been working closely with Mhoze Chikowero, a professor in the history department, who has guided him in structuring the demonstration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After seeing the video of Minneapolis police officer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sanders said he immediately felt “clenched with anger and disappointment” and took the day off from school to gather his feelings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was tired of being here and not doing anything, and I had to turn my sadness into educated outrage,” he said. “And I felt like the only way that I would be able to relieve that is through reaching out to the community and starting something like this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After posting the information for the demonstration on Thursday night on Twitter, Sanders said he was only expecting about 30 to 40 people to be in attendance. But now, “hundreds of people might show up”; almost 1,000 people have liked Sanders’ post about the demonstration on Twitter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This kind of all happened really fast. I wasn’t expecting as much community support for this to really take off like that,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are also keeping the coronavirus pandemic in mind, as they are wary of spreading the virus through I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice Dumlao, a fifth-year global studies major and former A.S. senator who reached out to Sanders to help organize the demonstration, spoke at a special Senate meeting on Friday asking senators to attend the march and said he would be there passing out masks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview, Dumlao said that he reached out to Sanders after seeing his tweet about wanting to organize a demonstration and offered to make flyers with QR codes to pass out to people who might not know what the demonstration was about, in addition to passing out masks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I work at Pardall Center and we are distributing masks, Mondays and Tuesdays 11 to 1 p.m., and because we have so many right now, and obviously it was gonna be a big gathering, I asked my supervisor if I could pass [the masks] out and I just got clearance,” Dumlao said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao added that since the event is a march, it’ll be easier for people to maintain a safe distance from people they don’t live with, and that organizers plan to make an announcement before the march reminding people to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Dumlao said he offered to lead a group of non-Black people to be liaisons if police officers got involved and “things got heated.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanders </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeyVibe5/status/1266510405288919040\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Twitter that he had been in communication with UCPD and said that officers told him that “they will not attempt to impede or stop the protest as long as it remains peaceful.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the demonstration scheduled to take place in less than a day, Sanders said it is his hope that the event serves as a reminder to “subscribe to the acknowledgement of [keeping] the Black community at your heart and to keep standing up against racial injustice.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can’t pick and choose when to be an activist or when to support Black people. It has to be an all-the-time thing for sure,” he said. “Even if [this demonstration] encourages like five people to always be aware of the struggles that Black students go through and gives Black students the feeling of being seen here in this community, that’s definitely the goal of this whole thing.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

As UC Santa Barbara’s representative for the student body at the statewide and national level, he said his overall goal was to make sure “that students are [aware of] these issues that affect them at those levels.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the year, Beasley said he picked up other projects, such as the fight against the construction of the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-22/students-condemn-uc-and-chancellor-yangs-involvement-in-thirty-meter-telescope-express-support-for-native-hawaiians/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty Meter Telescope</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (TMT) in Hawaii. Through </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-07/hawaiian-activists-speak-at-ucsb-town-hall-urge-uc-not-to-move-forward-with-telescope-construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campus events</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/uc-student-governments-call-for-divestment-of-thirty-meter-telescope-project/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open letters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Beasley said he and his office worked to inform students of Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s involvement with the telescope project, and in turn, make Yang aware of students’ discontent with the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While his work surrounding TMT was not part of his original platform, Beasley said spreading awareness about the project was one of his proudest accomplishments of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Life comes at you fast and at any moment you could have all of that thrown up in the air,” Beasley said. “And I was like, ‘Okay, I’m going to put this platform point to the side and focus on what students are actually suffering through right now.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on his work with TMT, Beasley said the biggest lesson he learned came from amplifying student voices through proper representation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you want to advocate for people that aren’t in the room, you need to bring them into the room. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t have them there with you,” he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s EVPSA office also saw the creation of its first organizing department, which serves to support other student organizations on campus by providing funding and assistance, Beasley said. Creating a new arm for the executive office required the office to rewrite portions of A.S. Legal Code, but Beasley said he believed the change helped to strengthen the office as a whole.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s EVPSA office also had the opportunity to tap into the United States Student Association (USSA) budget, which Beasley said allowed him to allocate $30,000 to UCSB Lobby Corps to cover the group’s lobbying trips and increase the number of Washington D.C. and Sacramento trips the group could take. Because USSA has not hosted any events since 2018, Beasley said the lock-in fee language surrounding the organization permits him to access its budget. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the extra funding, Beasley said the EVPSA office also collaborated with UCSB’s Human Rights Board to host a Criminal Justice Lobby Day, in which group members flew to D.C. to “talk to legislators about legalizing marijuana at the federal level,” along with other criminal justice reforms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said his office also saw success in other areas as well. This year’s EVPSA office was the first to fully fund the UCSB Black Student Union’s annual Afrikan Black Coalition Conference and also hosted 22 A.S. fellows — the most of any of the five executive offices, Beasley said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Beasley noted that he did have some difficulty with the Students of Color Conference in fall quarter. The event is organized by the UC Student Association (UCSA), and each UC’s Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) typically sends a delegation of students. Beasley said there were issues coordinating between UCSA and UCSB S.C.O.R.E., calling it “one of the top three toughest moments” of this past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley added that the coronavirus pandemic upended his plans for spring quarter. He said he had planned on hosting UCSB’s Gender Bias Summit with Students Against Sexual Assault President and EVPSA-elect Alia Reynolds, as well as attending the annual Student Lobby Conference (SLC), which he said is one of the EVPSA office’s largest events of the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of concern for student safety amid the coronavirus pandemic, Beasley said SLC was canceled following a vote from UCSA’s Executive Vice President representatives from each UC, including Beasley. The cancellation of SLC resulted in about $80,000 of unanswered refund requests for hotel reservations, which Beasley said wiped out UCSA’s “entire rainy day fund.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from canceled events, the timing of the coronavirus pandemic — which threw </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">winter quarter finals week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into a frenzy — left many students on edge about the nature of finals week. During this time, Beasley said he worked with A.S. President Alison Sir to create a Google form to field questions and concerns from students about the status of their exams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After accumulating over 250 responses, Beasley said he and Sir arranged a meeting with Yang, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and the chair of the Academic Senate, Henning Bohn, to review the student concerns and explore alternatives to in-person finals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got to the meeting and it was very high tension. Chancellor Yang was obviously under a lot of stress and pressure. He said he had faculty hitting him from all sides, saying that ‘you can’t force us to do an online course or do ProctorU or do this or do that,’” Beasley said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But he was also trying to level with us as students to do what was best for us,” he said, adding that he and Sir stressed to Yang that students are key stakeholders in the success of the university and that “faculty only exist on the campus because of students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After relaying student testimonies and continuing discussions with the Academic Senate and UCSB administration, Beasley said the university decided to allow professors a choice: either move all finals online or cancel them entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on his year as a whole, Beasley said the one thing he would change about his office is its accessibility to students. “Of course when you hear ‘A.S. President,’ you’re like, ‘Okay, they’re the ones who are supposed to advocate for me,’” but far too often, he said, students forget that other executive offices may be a better fit for their needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds will be sworn in as the new EVPSA during tonight’s Senate meeting. Beasley said he hopes that Reynolds will expand the EVPSA office and use it to “continue connecting with the marginalized groups on campus, to learn about cultural issues outside of her comfort zone and to keep an open mind to new challenges and experiences.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
