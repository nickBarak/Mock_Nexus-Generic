<em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email, sent out by Jeffrey Stopple, associate vice chancellor for undergraduate education, and Leesa Beck, director of Summer Sessions, said the decision to move all Summer Sessions courses online came after “further consultation with campus health experts, faculty, students, and key stakeholders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is also working to provide digital alternatives to lab and studio courses, Stopple and Beck said in the email, adding that “Instructors in the sciences and arts are collaborating with the pedagogical experts in Instructional Development” to restructure the classes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus housing will also not be “generally available” during Summer 2020, and students who cancel their summer quarter or drop classes by the deadlines “will receive a full refund,” according to the website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two UCSB pre-college programs — the Research Mentorship Program and the Summer Research Academies — will also be held remotely, according to the website; a third program, the Summer Scholars Program, which allows high school students to enroll in two classes for college credit, has been canceled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university has yet to announce a decision about the status of fall quarter instruction. </span></p>\n<div

At UC Santa Barbara, for example, that includes an additional $103.50 RecCen2 Expansion fee, a $60.06 UCen Expansion fee and a $39.39 Transit System fee, </span><a href=\"https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/feeschedules/ucsbfees_2019-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">among others.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was at home. I wasn’t using the library and I wasn’t using the gym and I wasn’t using the pool. But I was paying for it,” Brandmeyer, a third-year psychology major, said in an interview with the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she is frustrated by the UC’s dismissal of student pleas and petitions — one of which </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/regents-of-the-university-of-california-ucsb-spring-quarter-tuition-adjustment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made rounds</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at UCSB in March — and for standing its ground on refusing to withhold student fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though most student fees are relatively small compared to the price of tuition, students who choose to foot the bill with loans will be forced to shell out “thousands and thousands of dollars” down the line as their loans compound, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m very unsettled and I think it’s very hypocritical and revealing of what [the UC’s] true motive is,” she said. “At the end of the day, [they] just want to make money off us.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC declined to comment on the litigation but </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-10/university-of-california-announces-no-intention-to-adjust-tuition-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maintains</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on its </span><a href=\"https://www.ucop.edu/operating-budget/fees-and-enrollments/other-fee-information/payment-refunds.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar </span><a href=\"https://sundial.csun.edu/157547/news/csu-system-sued-for-refusing-to-refund-campus-related-fees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">class-action lawsuit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed by a Sonoma State University student against the California State University system on Monday, a spokesperson for the CSU system said it will “vigorously defend against the lawsuit,” EdSource </span><a href=\"https://edsource.org/2020/students-sue-california-universities-over-fees-lost-amid-pandemic/630377\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said the UC’s ambivalent response in supporting students prompted her to take legal action and “to be the voice” for those who are financially impacted by having their student fees withheld. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you’re accepted into the University of California, they were like, ‘We’re on your side. We want you to succeed. We want you to do research. We’re here to guide you through your four years,’” Brandemeyer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But the minute you show up,” she added, “it’s kind of like, ‘Okay, well you’re on your own now.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking note of the student response to the UC, Garcia said her law firm looked to </span><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-napolitano-refund-uc-campus-fees-for-spring-2020\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student-generated petitions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for fee reimbursements as a framework for what eventually developed into </span><a href=\"https://dicellolevitt.com/california-university-systems-sued-on-behalf-of-more-than-700000-students-for-refusing-to-refund-fees-in-wake-of-coronavirus-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> class-action lawsuits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We hope to achieve the goals that the students have wanted all along,” she said. “If you’ve seen those change.org petitions that were started, there are thousands of students across the country who have signed onto those.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to ensure that the schools will stop charging fees for services that are no longer available and return the funds that they’re holding onto for services that haven’t been provided,” Garcia added. “That money belongs to the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is no set date for the court to make a decision, Garcia maintained that the “goal is ultimately to get the students their money back… no matter how long that takes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandmeyer said she has faith that she will win the lawsuit, noting the outpour of students who are working nearly full-time while balancing a packed schedule amidst the pandemic. With feelings of uncertainty, frustration and desperation in mind, “I think that a lot of people are going to be standing their ground with this,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the point where a lot of people are saying enough is enough. [The UC] is saying ‘Oh, we’re saving this money for a rainy day,’” Brandmeyer said. “This is a rainy day.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Full-time employees are eligible for 128 hours of paid leave, while part-time employees are receiving a proportional amount. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for many student employees who send money home to support their families or juggle multiple jobs to pay their way through college, paid administrative leave or </span><a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/work-study-and-covid-19-information\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote work study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn’t enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stevie Mendoza, a second-year sociology major who worked at the Carrillo Dining Commons, is experiencing this firsthand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“After I pay rent, I always have a little extra money, and I don’t spend a lot of money on food, being able to eat at Carrillo, so I keep a little extra cash and send it back home to help out,” Mendoza said. “I’m really stressed out because I help my parents with money for their phone bills and utilities, and [I] have always been able to help out.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza said she was frustrated by the ambivalence of the dining commons’ upper management, who at first assured the student workers that “we would keep our jobs” after news that spring quarter would be held </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remotely</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> began to circulate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That quickly changed, however. “A lot of people were waiting on canceling their housing contracts to work, and then they waited to tell us that, ‘Oh yeah, by the way, you no longer have a job.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to UCSB Spokesperson Andrea Estrada, “Campus Dining has not let any student employees go” for good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza said she is unable to go home and has to stay in I.V. and pay rent but is now out of a job. Though her employment may be restored in the future, researchers predict that a return to normalcy could be months away, The Atlantic </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/pandemic-summer-coronavirus-reopening-back-normal/609940/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With few options left, Medoza filed for unemployment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Now I don’t even have an income for myself. So it’s not only scary for me but scary for my family back home. There’s no income for me to pay rent and I’m just working off my savings, which I’m lucky I have as a college student,” Mendoza said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“But I also don’t have enough to help [my parents] anymore,” she added. “And my mom lost her job, too.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza is not alone. JoAnn Vo, a second-year biology major and an usher for Arts and Lectures, learned she had lost her job after reading a chain of emails sent out to Arts and Lectures employees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t hear anything about losing my job until they sent an email out,” Vo said. “First it was an email like, ‘We’re canceling all events.’ And then there was a second email [adding], ‘Oh, we’re also firing the entire student department.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vo, like Mendoza, also felt that the upper management of Arts and Lectures was “very opaque” in its communication with students and poorly conveyed how students would be affected. Though she is now home and looking for a new job, Vo said Arts and Lectures did say it was offering online positions for the time being but has not made a decision on rehiring students for on-campus jobs in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think [the students] who got the worst out of all of it were those who worked at the dining commons,” Vo said. “I’m kind of glad I had my position, to be honest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thunderdome, much like the dining commons, the University Library and most dorms, is now an echo chamber. With all UCSB sports </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-12/big-west-basketball-tournament-cancelled/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">canceled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the rest of the year and the NCAA season </span><a href=\"https://www.ncaa.com/live-updates/ncaa-cancels-remaining-winter-and-spring-championships-due-coronavirus-concerns\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cut short</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, few employees are left to maintain the Thunderdome’s glossy hardwood floor, according to Denice Barba-Medina, a second-year sociology major who works at the Thunderdome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a really fun job. We got to watch events, like the basketball games, and then afterwards cleaned up and made sure the Thunderdome was ready for whatever other events we have,” she said. “I guess you could say we’re kind of glorified janitors.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Vo’s and Mendoza’s experiences with the upper management of their respective employers, Barba-Medina appreciated the lengths to which her bosses tried to give her hours. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My supervisors are awesome and so is the manager. They were trying to find whatever hours they could to scrape up so that way whoever does decide to stay on campus can work, maybe like 10 to 15 hours per pay period,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barba-Medina, who lived in San Rafael Residence Hall, said she ultimately took the housing reimbursement and went home, foregoing her job at the Thunderdome and her income. But “we’re not completely laid off,” she said, adding that “we just don’t have the ability to work remotely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although she plans to return to her job when she can, Barba-Medina said she is grateful to be at home and acknowledges that “I’m coming from a place of privilege, and even if I didn’t get anything back, I know I’d be okay.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My parents are pretty good right now. They weren’t hit too hard. My mom is a stay-at-home mom, but my dad is a truck driver. So for him, he’s been working a ton right now because he’s one of those essential jobs at the moment,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But money aside, Barba-Medina said she, like many other students at UCSB, is saddened by the abrupt loss of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-30/i-didnt-have-any-time-to-say-goodbye-to-anybody-ucsb-students-lament-a-senior-year-cut-short/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">celebrations and goodbyes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many of which she was looking forward to before her fellow coworkers graduated. With social distancing and </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-19/here-are-the-new-rules-as-newsom-orders-all-californians-to-stay-at-home\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stay-at-home orders</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in place, however, those opportunities have vanished. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like I still haven’t wrapped my head around everything that just happened,” Barba-Medina said. “But I think we all have to find comfort in that it’s not just us, literally everyone around the world is going through the same thing.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nadia Lee Abushanab contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Comprised of business proposals and neighborhood compatibility ratings, the merit-based application is how Santa Barbara County plans to license its most qualified applicants, according to Gina Fischer, a representative from the 3rd District office. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Fischer, the board of supervisors had originally planned to open a recreational dispensary application process in July 2o19 under a lottery system. But at an I.V. Community Network meeting in July, residents questioned the lottery system’s effectiveness; raffling away a license, Fischer said, opens the door to “a huge amount” of speculation about a retailer’s intentions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facing concern from her constituents, 3rd District Supervisor Joan Hartmann proposed a merit-based application in lieu of the county’s lottery system at the Board of Supervisors’ August meeting, Fischer said. There, the board voted 4 to 1 in favor of the new application.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One advantage of the merit-based application, which has already seen success in the cities of </span><a href=\"https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/business/license/cannabis/past_permit_solicitations.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.chulavistaca.gov/home/showdocument?id=18432\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chula Vista</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is that it spells out what the lottery system couldn’t: a way in which applicants can demonstrate in their applications that the needs of the community are a priority, Fischer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What do they do for the community? Are they a local business? Do they source locally?” Fischer asked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applicants answer those questions in the form of a “community benefits package,” a portion of the application where prospective retailers showcase their community outreach and detail how their business operations would be tailored to the needs of residents, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The merit-based application will be scored in two parts. First, an independent third party contractor and “select county staff” will review and score each application, Fischer said; then in a second phase, county staff members will review each application for neighborhood compatibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The two scores will be combined for a rank-ordering. The highest ranked application in each area will have 90 days to complete its business license application,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The county will then award one license to the top applicant in each of the county’s six “community plan areas”: Orcutt, Los Alamos, Santa Ynez, Eastern Goleta Valley, Isla Vista and a combined Summerland and Toro Canyon, according to the ordinance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each “community plan area” is appropriately zoned for a recreational cannabis storefront and takes “sensitive receptor areas,” such as schools, day cares and youth centers, into consideration through a 750-foot “zoning buffer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UCSB has a day care on campus. So the 750-foot boundary starts at the end of the light tunnel on Pardall and you would measure 750 feet [from there]. So any commercial zone and any commercial space within that buffer would be ineligible,” Fischer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the zoning buffer, another stipulation is that applicants must either own the unit they plan to turn into a storefront or have “written authorization from the owner to operate a cannabis operation at the site,” the ordinance read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because cannabis is still federally outlawed, applicants cannot partner with a business owner who is using a federally-backed bank lender for their commercial property. For the few units in I.V. that fall within the county’s commercial cannabis zone and are owned outright, Fischer said applicants were “promising [those property owners] the moon.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would bet my year’s salary that, within the zone that’s eligible, everybody who owns a commercial property has been approached by one dispensary or another, whether they’re local or far away,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the neighborhood compatibility scores are contingent on the county’s six neighborhood meetings, which were originally scheduled to take place through April and May. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In light of social distancing restrictions, however, those meetings are postponed. And without them, the licensing process “cannot begin until the community meetings are completed,” said Barney Melekian, Assistant County executive officer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We pulled the item from the Board agenda and won’t bring it back until we can provide an updated timeline,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jonathan Abboud, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) general manager, the I.V. CSD is focused on facilitating “the best possible public participation and figuring out what the community benefit should be from the dispensary” in I.V., such as donating to a local nonprofit. Beyond that, however, the I.V. CSD has been relatively uninvolved with the process, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The window for applicants to apply for a license will last one week and was originally slated to open sometime this July. But the timeline, including the application submission, review and scoring periods, will be delayed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Fischer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But far ahead of the scheduled deadlines, some recreational cannabis shops have their eye on the gold mine of Isla Vista, where the most successful applicant would have direct access to one of California’s </span><a href=\"http://www.usa.com/rank/california-state--population-density--city-rank.htm?hl=Isla+Vista&amp;hlst=CA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most densely populated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> areas. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One applicant, </span><a href=\"https://www.coastaldispensary.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coastal Dispensary</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the City of Santa Barbara’s </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2019/09/21/coastal-cannabis-dispensary-opens-on-chapala/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> licensed storefront, has already held several meetings in Isla Vista to gauge the community’s atmosphere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Devon Wardlow, director of Public Affairs, and Myles Peck, director of Business Development, Coastal Dispensary is looking to its success as the City of Santa Barbara’s </span><a href=\"https://www.santabarbaraca.gov/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=213149\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highest-scoring</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> applicant as a model for its application to the county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are 100% invested in Isla Vista. Given that the CEO and the majority of our executive team all went to UCSB, this is a huge opportunity. And on a personal level, it really matters to us,” Wardlow said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cookies, a San Francisco-based dispensary that also expressed interest in having a storefront in I.V., did not respond to multiple requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In compliance with the ordinance, Coastal Dispensary has locked in an I.V. property that falls within the county’s commercial cannabis zone – located next to Buddha Bowls. Peck estimates that the roughly 4,000 square-foot storefront will staff about 20 employees and will run from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of aesthetics, Peck said that the I.V. storefront’s design would follow that of its predecessors and will feature an atmosphere that is “bright,” “open” and “clean.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the design is more than just aesthetics, Wardlow said. It also breaks down the idea that “‘Hey, this is a pot shop,’ to ‘this is a legitimate big-time business that is contributing to the economy in California across the board and to the local economy,’” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wardlow maintained that Coastal Dispensary’s connection to the I.V. community is what sets their application apart from others. To bolster Coastal Dispensary’s “community benefits package,” Wardlow said she is enlisting the help of prominent community members, such as I.V. Food Co-op general manager Melissa Cohen and I.V. Foot Patrol Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Down the line, Wardlow added that she plans to partner with another five to seven community members from “different facets of Isla Vista” to gain additional input for the benefits package.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, Coastal Dispensary has held two different informational sessions in I.V., most recently in  </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-26/cannabis-professionals-search-for-community-opinions-on-possible-isla-vista-dispensary/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">February</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There, the dispensary fielded questions and concerns from residents about the prospect of a recreational cannabis storefront in town.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community benefits aside, Peck also said that the dispensary is working on a way in which it can tailor its products to the demographics of I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will cater our menu,” he said. “So for a student who is looking for a $2 or $1 joint, we’re going to carry more of that. A lot of stuff that will cater to what the college kids need will be in terms of budget and pricing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of price point, Wardlow maintained that every Coastal Dispensary product is sourced from regional growers within the state. But the allure of budget-friendly cannabis and lab-tested products may not be enough to entice students — who commonly purchase cannabis through unregulated means — to visit the store, Peck said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re going to be fighting that for a while,” he remarked. “Once you get experience with going in and buying stuff at a real shop — it’s convenient and it’s fast and it’s quick and it’s safe — you’re going to like it. That does start to drive home with the customer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Wardlow said Coastal Dispensary would carry over its cross marketing campaigns with neighborhood businesses, loyalty programs and discounts to the new store, all of which would be “more robust in I.V.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If their application is chosen, Wardlow said that Coastal Cares, the company’s employee community service program, would be “tailored specifically” to issues that are pertinent to the I.V. community, such as basic needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a contract with the City of Santa Barbara, the dispensary agreed to donate 2% of its profits back to the community; though a work-in-progress, Wardlow said she hopes to include something similar in her community benefits proposal to the county. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You haven’t seen something like this where a brand new industry has the potential for massive economic changes for the state,” Wardlow said. “And I think that’s really exciting to be an operator in this situation because how we work is going to determine how successful this is.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to keep Santa Barbara as the gold standard of retail cannabis.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

In Santa Barbara County, there are </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-27/coronavirus-in-santa-barbara-county-case-counts-and-locations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">47.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, 38 UCSB students have been tested for the coronavirus, with no positive results as of yet, Javanbakht said. As of March 25, 18 tests have come back negative and 20 tests are pending results, which can take up to a week to get back. All 38 tests were conducted through </span><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/coronavirus-labcorp-quest-diagnostics-are-growing-testing-capacity.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quest Diagnostics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a private testing laboratory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-08/ucsb-student-health-executive-director-explains-coronavirus-protocol-and-ongoing-measures/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">months</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Student Health has adhered to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regarding the coronavirus and worked with numerous campus entities to devise transmission prevention measures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But recently, Javanbakht said Student Health has also begun designating a prescription pickup area, conducting virtual appointments and cordoning off a section of Student Health so “students who have any kind of respiratory symptom are in a separate part of the building” and to minimize contact between students and workers at Student Health, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any student who visits Student Health during this time will have their temperature taken and will be asked if they are experiencing any symptoms associated with the coronavirus, such as fever, shortness of breath or cough, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our main goal is to do what we can to help our students so that if they end up needing to go to an outside urgent care or emergency room — if COVID spreads as we expect it to — urgent cares and emergency rooms can be really overrun and their demands can be really high,” Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said that although the off-campus area is out of Student Health’s purview, the university “acknowledges that they are closely tied” with Isla Vista, where thousands of UCSB students packed their bags to ride out the pandemic at home. As a result, the university is closely monitoring how safe it is for students to not only return to campus, but also to Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is actively encouraging students to stay away from Isla Vista if they can; in an email sent out to the student body on March 23, the university urged students to stay at home if they traveled for spring break, noting that Isla Vista has a population of more than 20,000 in less than two square miles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said it is “highly unlikely” that things will return to normal by the end of spring quarter, but “depending on how well we implement our interventions now, as far as social distancing, that could put us in a good position [to return in the] summer.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the situation doesn’t improve by summer, he said, “we could be looking at fall” for in-person classes to resume.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amidst cancellations and closures, from UCSB’s </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-26/breaking-ucsb-postpones-commencement-will-host-virtual-ceremony-in-june/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">postponed commencement ceremony</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> announced Thursday to the order for all </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-25/as-santa-barbara-county-tightens-grip-on-coronavirus-prevention-i-v-businesses-hollow-out/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">non-essential businesses to close</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, many young adults </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/deniers-and-disbelievers-if-i-get-corona-i-get-corona.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have ignored calls</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for social distancing in favor of going out and spending time with friends. But students can risk infecting themselves and others when they do so, Javanbakht said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the virus transmits through “secretions” that come from coughing, talking or exhaling, the closer people are to one another, the higher the risk their interactions carry, he explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we’re talking about interacting in a way that would be less risky, interacting outside is always better than any kind of indoor space,” he said. “And keeping six feet regardless of where you are, even outdoors, is much better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In transmitting the virus, Javanbakht said each person acts like an “ember.” People who have the virus can spread it to those who do not — by seeing friends, going out and entering other people’s personal spaces — and create a wildfire of contagion, but by staying at home, “the fire’s not going to spread anywhere because it’s contained within [a] house.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication among housemates also matters, Javanbahkt said. For people who plan to stay in I.V. and are living with multiple housemates, he stressed the importance of keeping outside interactions to a minimum — all it takes is one housemate to spread the virus to everyone in the house.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If somebody has three roommates and they’ve lived together all year and they plan to stay together for the rest of spring quarter, that’s great,” he said. “As long as they keep it to those three people and they don’t have people coming over or going over to someone else’s house.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although all in-person classes have been </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">canceled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Javanbakht said campus entities from all corners of the university frequently meet to discuss protocols, contingency plans and emergency operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entities include the UCSB COVID-19 Task Force, made up of the chancellor, vice chancellor, faculty and financial department members, as well as the COVID-19 operations team, which includes the vice chancellor and representatives from Student Health and Housing and Dining Services, he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was during these twice-a-day meetings, which he said have been taking place for several weeks, that campus entities such as the University Library and Recreation Center made the decision to close indefinitely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Javanbakht said the university plans to update the student body about which services they can access during a digital spring quarter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the updates will detail “what’s going to be done remotely, what kinds of services are available in person, what’s operating and what’s not operating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are plenty of [messages] that will be coming out as the situation evolves,” he said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

dining switch to delivery or takeout services and that any planned St. Patrick’s Day celebrations be canceled. All grocery stores, markets and food banks will remain open, as they provide “critical services to the community,” according to the department’s press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While many bars, nightclubs and pubs traditionally hold events for St. Patrick’s Day, these are particularly dangerous at this point in the coronavirus pandemic, as they could result in widespread transmission of the disease in Santa Barbara County,” the department’s press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elliot Spechler, a general manager at Baja Sharkeez, a downtown bar and nightclub frequented by UC Santa Barbara students, said he first heard about the new restriction on Sunday, when California Governor Gavin Newsom </span><a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article241212146.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bars, wineries, nightclubs and breweries within the state to shut down operations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of now, Baja Sharkeez is open and will remain open “until they come down and ask us to close,” Spechler said. Along with removing “half of our chairs and barstools,” Spechler said that Baja Sharkeez is making other sanitary adjustments as well, such as following the six-feet social distancing rule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have procedures sent down from our corporate offices that we’re following as employees and staff, just to make sure that we’re keeping [everything] as sanitary and clean as possible,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the restaurant has no plans as of now to shutter its doors, Spechler maintained that a new mandate could change the situation entirely. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re gonna take it hour by hour,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Study Hall, one of two bars in Isla Vista, could not be reached for comment. A manager from Dublin’s Sports Grill, the second Isla Vista bar, declined to comment until an official mandate from the county is released. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

As a result, ID isn’t working to fully convert in-person classes into digital ones but to create “hybrid” classrooms by bolstering the teaching technology that’s already available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Yang first announced the switch to online coursework last Tuesday, ID has helped teaching staff incorporate programs such as </span><a href=\"https://collaborate.ucsb.edu/services/gauchospace\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GauchoSpace</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://gauchocast.ucsb.edu/Panopto/Pages/Home.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panopto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://ucsb.zoom.us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoom</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-01/from-course-to-source-new-learning-platform-streamlines-communication-between-students-and-professors/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nectir</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into their online lectures by holding ongoing workshops, which will be hosted through spring break, Michaels said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the workshops, instructors can ask questions pertaining to the different software programs, such as how to take attendance, record and post lectures, distribute and grade assignments, hold digital office hours and even call on students when they digitally raise their hand, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But a majority of the remote instruction tools aren’t new, according to Michaels. When the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas Fire</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> broke out in 2017, ID worked to equip instructors with tools to teach classes remotely in the event that in-person classes were canceled, which laid the groundwork for ID’s current efforts, Michaels said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were able to successfully meet the need [for online instruction] at that point in time and have retained those resources,” he said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three to four weeks ago, Michaels said ID began preparing workshops and started assessing how prepared the university’s digital teaching materials were so that “if things really go sideways,” ID was “ready to move as quickly as possible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Michaels said some professors have had issues with online assessments, such as GauchoSpace quizzes, which can crash when too many students are tested simultaneously. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels said ID is offering instructors one-on-one consultations to work around these problems by providing solutions, such as making a GauchoSpace quiz available over a 12 to 24 hour period “to spread the impact out as much as possible” and prevent these systems from crashing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students on social media have also posed questions about the fate of their waitlisted classes next quarter, as digital classrooms lack the constraint of physical seating. Michaels said waitlists will still exist, as class enrollment information is stored in the campus registrar — “which constitutes the class roster” — and is fed into GauchoSpace.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classroom attendance will follow similarly, Michaels said; a professor using Zoom or GauchoCast can use their class roster on GauchoSpace to take attendance based on who joins the digital class, just as they would have done in a physical classroom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The idea is to try to keep that roster information as up-to-date as humanly possible. The wait list, and to a certain extent, the attendance tool, in the absence of a face-to-face class can be a way to emulate [that] the student shows up on the first day at class and walks up to the faculty member afterwards to get an add code,” Michaels said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaels highlighted ID’s efforts to provide the university with different teaching solutions under a tight turnaround but acknowledged that access to online courses is still an issue for students who have to go home and don’t have a laptop or internet connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The campus recognizes that that’s a big issue and there are lots of people working really hard to try to come up with a workaround solution for that,” Micahels said, adding that the Enterprise Technology Services, Student Affairs and the University Library are currently working on a solution to provide students with long-term loaner laptops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But “the missing part is if they don’t have a network at home,” Michaels said, so a loaner laptop won’t be of much use if a student is looking to join their class on Zoom or GauchoSpace without an internet connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, however, Michaels said that most instructors, specifically the ones who attended workshops, have adjusted well to the transition from in-person to digital classrooms. He said the biggest issue lies in how confident each instructor feels in their ability to teach an online class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have over a thousand faculty members … we’ve got some faculty members who’ve been teaching fully online courses, primarily through summer sessions, for almost 10 years now. For them, this is an adjustment, but it’s using tools that they’ve already become very comfortable with,” Michaels said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For other faculty members, some elements of the technology landscape or ecosystem that we have is all new territory for them,” he added. “Everybody is figuring out how they’re going to cope with it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As other UC campuses roll out their own remote instruction programs, Michaels said ID shares its new technologies, information and resources through the </span><a href=\"https://cio.ucop.edu/meet-the-educational-technology-leadership-committee/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educational Technology Leadership Committee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (ETLC), a decade-old collaborative group that represents the ID office equivalent at each UC campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have regular monthly Zoom meetings. We have an annual face-to-face meeting. We’re constantly sharing information about things that are going on in our campuses,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As soon as campuses started ramping up [remote instruction efforts], one of the things that the ETLC did, besides communicating via email, is we started a Google doc with links to all of the resource sites that we were all developing or expanding,” he said, “so that all of us had the benefit of seeing what kinds of support we’re providing to our faculty.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As students prepare to go home for spring break, Michaels said ID’s chief concern is ensuring that instructors are prepared to teach classes remotely, while also continuing to improve the teaching resources that are already available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing that I really appreciated is that everybody recognizes that this is an unprecedented situation. The faculty members that have been coming to our workshops are uniformly thankful to have the help,” Michaels said. “They’ve been very supportive of us, which is awesome.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health. </span><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said Student Health is strictly adhering to coronavirus </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guidelines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), which include monitoring potential cases for trademark coronavirus symptoms — fever and respiratory issues — in conjunction with an individual’s travel history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Health is coordinating directly with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, which coordinates with the CDPH; the CDPH reports to the CDC, which then reports to the World Health Organization, Javanbakht said. The chain of command, however, is not a strict hierarchy, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student exhibits coronavirus symptoms, Javanbakht said the university would notify the SB County Public Health Department about the potential case, which will advise Student Health as to whether or not to test the individual based on “how suspicious” their case is or the likelihood that they may have coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If it’s a pretty suspicious [case], then the next step is, ‘Okay, who else could have been exposed?’ And if it’s a student, that [case] comes back to us,” Javanbakht said. “And if that student’s symptoms are in line with the guidelines, that’s someone that we need to test.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But students don’t always go straight to Student Health, Javanbakht said. It’s up to the SB County Public Health Department to notify Student Health if a student exhibits symptoms somewhere else, such as at a local emergency room or urgent care, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Student Health and the SB County Public Health Department reasonably suspect that a student may have coronavirus, the public health department will work to pin down who they’ve been in contact with in the past two weeks to “expand that circle,” according to Javanbakht.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an example, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would calculate the risk a potentially infected student posed to their classmates by sending someone to campus to survey the features of classroom spaces, including looking at the room’s dimensions and the space between tables or desks to determine which students may have been exposed if a student had coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, Javanbakht said Student Health would work with the registrar’s office to find people who were potentially exposed to coronavirus and would let them know that “they might need to be tested.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a student does test positive for coronavirus, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department would contact individuals who were “close enough to be exposed” and instruct them to isolate themselves and “find their own room separate from everyone else.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people who had a low-risk exposure, Javanbakht said they could still go about their day but said that it was important to report symptoms as soon as possible, because “then we need to intervene.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If UCSB runs out of space to house exposed students, Javanbakht said the SB County Public Health Department will provide the university with additional space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, UCSB and Isla Vista are notorious for their often-cramped living situations, so “if people are in close quarters,” Javanbakht said, “that’s absolutely a factor.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This stuff tends to live on surfaces, and if you have a lot of people close [to each other] touching the common surfaces, yeah, the risk tends to be higher than someone who’s out on a farm by themselves,” he added, stressing the importance of keeping good hygiene.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep the campus community informed about the coronavirus, Student Health has sent a number of emails to the student body in the past two months to quell concerns and provide updates on potential cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the scenes, Javanbakht said Student Health has reached out to campus entities that deal with a high volume of students, such as the Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises, the Department of Recreation and the University Library, to detail hygiene methods that can decrease the spread of coronavirus on campus, such as using hand sanitizer and reminding students to wash their hands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Feb. 13 emergency operations meeting, a number of campus representatives met to discuss a potential response to coronavirus cases on campus, with each representative giving feedback on what resources they could provide in case of an outbreak on campus, Javanbakht said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht also noted that all five UC medical centers and all 10 UC campuses participate in a twice-a-week phone call with the UC Office of the President (UCOP) to share information about positive and potential coronavirus cases.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student Health is also in contact with the UCOP medical director, who works with the medical directors at each UC campus to inform them about ongoing cases at universities outside the UC and their efforts to treat and contain them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, Javanbakht said Student Health is in the midst of preparing a message for the student body about coronavirus and traveling for spring break, as many students are a couple weeks away from packing their bags and leaving Santa Barbara to go home or on vacation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javanbakht said the message will warn students about traveling to countries impacted by coronavirus and the possibility of being quarantined in another country or being isolated when returning to campus, he said. It will also include a reminder to report any possible symptoms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So between now and the end of spring break, as developments come up, if something changes, if there’s a new area of activity that we need to be concerned about, then we send messages again,” Javanbakht added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As coronavirus spreads, so does fear, which Javanbakht stressed as the “biggest threat to our campus.” Social media and rumors can instill fears that aren’t real or rational, and news headlines can trigger “fear mongering” if written poorly, he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If all you’re looking at is coronavirus updates, over time, it can give a really distorted view and some people can take on what’s called a catastrophic view — that this is a catastrophe,” he said. “Realistically speaking, right now, the risk to 24,000 students on this campus [is] still relatively low.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Again, things might change but overall, right now, go about your day [and] practice good hand hygiene,” Javanbakht said. “We’re doing everything we can.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Yang to “email UCSC administration and the UC Office of the President denouncing the threats to terminate wildcat strikers and request[s] that UCOP opens negotiations on a COLA for graduate students at all UC campuses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White said in an interview with the Nexus that she feels that the needs of graduate students are sometimes left out in the greater conversation of student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of times on undergraduate UC campuses, a lot of the emphasis is on undergraduate students and resources for them,” she said. “But I think a lot of times, people forget about graduate students and TAs and it’s not as big of a topic, not only on UC campuses, but nationwide.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos, who first learned about the COLA movement after one of her TAs “took the time to educate us on the issue” by holding her class’s section at the 16-hour-long Cheadle Hall </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sit-in</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last Friday, said “it’s insane that [a COLA is] a fight that our grad students have to go through because we feel so blessed to be at this institution, but so many people are struggling to make things stay afloat.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m a student who solely relies on financial aid through UCSB, as well as whatever FAFSA is able to provide me. So I’m just trying to fathom how I would barely be able to scrape by and have a healthy living situation,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond giving graduate students support from the resolution, White said that Associated Students (A.S.) also paid to reserve Corwin Pavilion for the COLA General Assembly meeting on Monday, where graduate students voted to begin striking on Thursday. In addition, Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi said during Senate that the Internal Vice President’s Office will “fund COLA for up to $1,000 for supplies.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Daniel Segura-Esquivel, a student sponsor on the resolution, was outspoken about the Senate’s lack of engagement with not just the COLA movement but with student activism this year, slamming his fellow senators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People continuously come up to me, asking me, ‘Where are the elected representatives that we supposedly look up to?’ With the COLA movement going on, it’s not just enough for a couple of us to be showing up,” Segura said to the Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos and White, who both confirmed they will be present at Thursday’s wildcat strike alongside graduate students, emphasized the need for undergraduate support as a pipeline to create awareness about this issue and to rally the student body to support a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the strike at Santa Cruz started, they did not have a lot of grad students striking. They didn’t have any documentation of faculty support or undergraduate support. I think a really cool part about our [COLA] movement is that we’ve already started to document all this undergraduate and faculty support,” White said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And I think it’s going to be really helpful moving forward in our dealings with administration,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White also made note that although the lifestyles and responsibilities of graduate students are different from those of their undergraduate student counterparts, they are not mutually exclusive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Their living conditions are our learning conditions,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katherine Swartz contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 27, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

He added that UCGPC performs systemwide and statewide advocacy and often works with the UC Board of Regents and the UC Office of the President (UCOP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strobel said that the timing of the UCOP’s </span><a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-napolitano-s-statement-her-invitation-meet-graduate-and-professional-council\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">press release</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Friday, combined with language that alluded to the potential discussion of a COLA, led some groups such as UCSC’s Graduate Student Association (GSA) to feel as if the UC was trying to circumvent ongoing demands for a COLA from organizers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strobel described the incident as a “misunderstanding” and said that UCGPC meets with Napolitano on a yearly basis, and, after its meeting in January 2020, UCGPC wanted to follow up with Napolitano on a handful of other issues. On Friday, Strobel said he was contacted by UCOP to meet again, to which UCGPC agreed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first discussion item listed in the UCOP press release was “cost of living,” followed by “housing.” Strobel maintained, however, that the meeting will not be about discussing a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The whole genesis of a potential board meeting with [Napolitano] and her team was to talk about state advocacy and some of the issues facing graduate students,” Strobel said. “But we’re not negotiating.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And that’s a sentiment she also expressed to me,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students across the UC system have now begun organizing for COLAs of their own, and at UC Santa Cruz, where graduate students have been on a formal strike since Feb. 10, they have withheld Fall Quarter 2019 grades as part of a wildcat strike. Last Friday, around 500 UC Santa Barbara graduate students </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-23/graduate-students-occupy-cheadle-hall-until-midnight-rally-for-cola-and-university-support-of-ucsc-strikers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marched</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the University Library to Cheadle Hall, where they occupied the space from 8 a.m. to midnight in solidarity with UCSC graduate students who were given a midnight deadline on Feb. 21 to end their strike and submit the grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of today, UCSC graduate students are still on strike, as the original Feb. 21 “doomsday” deadline to submit Fall Quarter 2019 grades was extended to Feb. 27, according to an email sent to faculty and graduate students from Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the UCOP press release sent out on Friday, UCSC’s GSA sent an email to Napolitano, noting that UCSC does not have any representation on the council that she would be meeting with.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For many reasons including, but not limited to, the fact that [UCGPC] does not represent our campus in any leadership or representational capacity, we are sorry to inform you that any decisions at which you may collectively arrive will not impact our organizing or our conviction,” the UCSC GSA wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, Cierra Sorin, president of UCSB’s GSA, said that the UCOP’s press release announcing a meeting with UCGPC was “uninspiring.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“While I don’t agree with that decision to reach out to UCGPC necessarily, since they have been pretty anti-COLA, I think it makes sense from a bureaucratic perspective,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Sorin said she doubted that UCGPC will specifically discuss a COLA at their meeting, she commented on UCGPC’s previous meeting at UCSB in early January, where she said “most of the folks in that room were anti-COLA.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite Sorin’s comments, Strobel said that UCGPC’s role is unrelated to the COLA movement. UCGPC is trying to alleviate rent burden through other measures, he said, such as reducing the cost of living for graduate students rather than advocating for a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve tried to go about it both in the the cost mitigating way, which is sort of open turf, like anyone can work on it,” Strobel said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“And then in terms of increasing pay, that’s a little more of a complicated dance because you have other stakeholders who have been working on the issue for a long time, who have the legal first dibs to it, like the union, in which case we played an important, coalitionary partner to some of those folks,” he continued.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW 2865), the union that represents UC student workers at the bargaining table, UCGPC is a form of student of student government that describes its role as “complementary” to unions, according to the statement, and plans to continue advocating to “reduce the financial burden” of graduate students’ living expenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the midst of an ongoing battle between graduate students and the UC, Strobel asserted that UCGPC has no plan to negotiate a COLA in its upcoming meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do think it was an honest misunderstanding,” he said.   </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; outsourcing has been a point of contention between the UC and its unions in the past. In May 2019, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, the UC’s largest union, went on a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/afscme-announces-strike-over-outsourcing-unfair-labor-practices/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one-day strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over outsourcing concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the new guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new guidelines build upon the original UC Regents motion from November and hinge on the practice of insourcing, which is when “[outside] service contracts are terminated or not renewed, and the work is transferred to UC employees,” according to the guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered services — contracted labor typically performed by union employees — are at the center of the new guidelines. According to the guidelines, the UC hopes to insource “to the fullest extent possible” moving forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To determine if a covered service is eligible for insourcing, the guidelines say the UC must consider “equipment needed to perform the service,” “technical skills or expertise required to perform the service” and the “law, Federal requirement, contract or grant requirement, or court decisions or orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the guidelines say the UC must notify AFSCME when a UC campus is ready “to transition contracted covered service work.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the guidelines, only certain types of covered services can continue to be outsourced, namely when it is “required by law, Federal requirement, contract or grant requirement, or court decisions or orders.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC deems an outsourced covered service necessary, the guidelines mandate that UC employees cannot be displaced as a result and that “any proposed contract for Covered Services that would result in displacement must be canceled.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guidelines also explain how the UC will accommodate insourced covered service workers by providing them with the matching wages — $15 an hour or more — and benefits of university employees. According to the guidelines, the UC Systemwide Human Resources office will determine the wage and benefit parity on a yearly basis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to covered service workers, the guidelines also explain how the UC should go about insourcing supplier employees, which are contractors employed by the UC to perform a specific type of work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To become insourced as a “UC career employee,” the guidelines say supplier employees must be eligible to work in the U.S., pass a background check and perform the same services at the same campus for 1,000 hours over a 12-month period or for “35% time over” a 36-month period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If AFSCME determines that a pending contract for covered services doesn’t comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the UC, the union has up to 14 calendar days to file a grievance with UCOP, according to the guidelines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, the guidelines say UCOP has 10 days to respond to the grievance; if UCOP denies the grievance, AFSCME can file an “appeal to arbitration” within 10 days of receiving UCOP’s response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of an appeal, the guidelines say that an arbitrator will determine whether or not the UC’s pending contract for the covered service is appropriate. If it is appropriate, the contract will remain in place; if it isn’t, the contract must be terminated and the university must “stop the contracting process,” the guidelines read. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/max.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/max-abrams/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Max Abrams</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Max Abrams serves as the lead news editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
