We hope this issue finds you well and enjoying the last moments of summer to their fullest. But the school year drawing closer is no reason to get dreary. Soon you will be diving into our campus and community and discovering awesome in every corner. Except the lagoon. There is no awesomeness in the lagoon.<br>\nWell… we guess if you Instagram it, the lagoon is okay but you’ll want some really nice filters. Demi suggests AfterLight.<br>\nAnyway, let this list be your map to all of the creative treasure Santa Barbara has to offer.

One of the ways UCSB supports this cause is through Battle of the Bands, which takes place every winter quarter in The Hub. Five local bands compete for the coveted opening spot of UCSB’s Extravaganza (see: X,), the spring quarter music festival. The best part about Battle of the Bands is that all kinds of music get showcased — last year’s bands consisted of rock and punk, reggae and funk. It’s seriously cool to check out I.V.’s latest and greatest talent for a free, tune-filled night. Mosh pits are usually welcome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The</strong> <strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">C</span>atalyst</strong></p>\n<p>Back for the first time in 6 years, the Catalyst literary magazine is a place where student fiction, poetry, art, photography, lyrics, expository profiles and creative writing meet in print. Collaborative work is always encouraged between students who send in submissions and designers who create the page. Each issue will be unique and flavorful, making the Catalyst itself an art object. The best part? Anyone can submit or get involved.

The best. We at Artsweek are huge fans of drag and have touted it before as possibly the highest form of art. At UCSB, you can experience drag at least twice a year during Pride Week. The campus’s queer advocacy organizations host a “Student Drag Night” as well as a night for professional performers. The events are free, fun and inspiring. Other drag events can sometimes be found at Wildcat downtown and at other clubs. We highly recommend going to all of them.<strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">D</span>rive-In Movie Theater<br>\n</strong></strong></strong>One of the littler known fun things to do in Goleta, the WestWind Santa Barbara Drive-In is probably the coziest date or cutest family hang out you could have. Movies start around 7 p.m., and you get to watch two features for seven bucks per person. Tuesday movie deals are $5. Just remember to bring some comfy blankets, a car with good speakers (sound comes through the radio) and maybe a pillow or two. Buttery popcorn and other goodies are sold in the lobby, and if you’re nice to the popcorn guy you could score a free blockbuster poster. He will also offer to jump your car just in case it dies in the middle of the movie, leaving you unable to witness anything but a mute screen. This has happened. Twice, actually.<strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51357\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51357\" data-attachment-id=\"51357\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-13/chilla-vista-2013-the-vibes-were-sweet/chillavista8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?fit=1280%2C854&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,854\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"chillavista8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-51357\" alt=\"chillavista8\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8-1024x683.jpeg?resize=610%2C406\" width=\"610\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/chillavista8.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-51357\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Earth Day Festival takes place at one of I.V.’s 25 parks every April.<br><em>Daily Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">E</span>arth Day Festival<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong>To commemorate Isla Vista’s commitment to a green community, Earth Day Festival takes place at one of I.V.’s 25 parks every April. Present are booths on energy conservation and calculating your carbon footprint, plus a sweet hunk of wood that transforms throughout the day as everyone paints on it. One of the coolest stations is the arts and crafts table, which is covered in hordes of neat recycled materials like buttons, bottle caps, corks and vintage postcards. Local bands perform all day for the hula-hoopers, slack-liners and girls wearing flower crowns. It’s a perfect way to spend a lazy afternoon.<strong><strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">F</span>OMO<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>FOMO: Fear Of Missing Out. You will experience this a lot in the next four years as most nights, there are more than a couple great options for how to spend your evening. There will be nights you will have to decide between going to your best friend’s art show, seeing Thom Yorke dance around a stage and sleeping. You will always have to decide between ____ and doing homework. Here’s my advice: If you can’t find someone to go with, see: G: Going to events by yourself. If you feel like you “should” go, you probably should. But if you haven’t slept in days and Cynthia will be so mad if I don’t show up to this thing and then she’s gonna make me take shots and then I’m gonna have to — JUST GO TO BED.

But it’s a haven for local artists and art lovers. The Funk Zone is located from about the end of State St. (where it goes under the freeway, nearing the water) to Garden St., between Montecito St. and Cabrillo Blvd. It’s an industrial area that has drawn artists to open studios and gallery spaces with the promise of cheap rent and local, like-minded people. It has gotten more gentrified in the last few years with the opening of some higher-end bars, eateries and wine tasting rooms (Seven, Red’s, Municipal Winemakers, Union Ale and Metropulos being just a few you should check out). But the heart of the Funk Zone remains utterly funky.<strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://funkzone.net/\">http://funkzone.net/</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">G</span>aucho Nights Calendar<br>\n</strong>2013 marks the new startup launch of the After Dark Gaucho Nights Calendar. After Dark is an organization that funds programs alternative to an I.V. party. As part of a commitment to safe and sober fun, the Gaucho Nights Calendar lists events ranging from recreational, entertainment, social and cultural, designed to cure every student’s after 5 o’clock boredom. Events are posted up every day on both the calendar and the GN Facebook page.

I hate to do it, to the point that I (Demi Anter, Artsweek Editor) missed entire meals freshman year because I wouldn’t go if I didn’t have someone to eat with. Listen, at some point you’re going to be like, Fuck it. WHO CARES? No one’s going to see you head-nodding to Yo Yo Ma by yourself and say, “Oh, that’s so sad … Look at that poor lonely person.” And if they do, that’s not someone you need to impress. Your self-confidence is impressive. Here — this is the key to going to stuff by yourself: Before or after the event, go outside in the common area, turn off your phone, and stand there. Wait. You will run into someone you know, or meet a new friend. Be open. Trust me. There’s too much cool stuff happening here to miss out every time you can’t convince a buddy to take the twenty-minute bike ride to Pollock Theater with you.</p>\n<p><strong>The </strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">H</span>ub</strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p>The Hub is a funny thing —during the day, it’s a spot to eat your Panda Express orange chicken bowl. By 6 o’clock on a Friday night, all the tables have been removed and it’s turned into a swanky, foggy night club. Flosstradamus has destroyed beats on The Hub stage (he came last year), and so has cool dudes The Dirty Heads (crowd surfed during this show two years ago) and SoCal groovy duo Best Coast (lead lady Bethany’s pseudo bitchy remarks about performing in front of The Panda Express were oddly refreshing, according to Natalie O’Brien).</p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">I</span>mprovability<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong>Improvability is the funniest place on Earth. It is the longest running comedy show in Santa Barbara, and is the premiere improv group in the city. Come for the free cocoa and stay for the laughs every Friday night at 8 at Embarcadero Hall.<strong><strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The </strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">J</span>ailhouse</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p>A little past the 68 block (those outback boonies of I.V.), you can walk the stairs, go down the beach towards Sands and the Goat Farm and you’ll see a cement structure called the Jailhouse. Covered in graffiti and sand, the Jailhouse bursts with the griminess that comes with being a college student. Guy friends come here to hang out, open up a bottle and a spray can and make art. Beer cans, glass and spray paint line the corners, but this garbage is almost beautiful. If you feel like exploring the ghosts of I.V.’s past, check out The Jailhouse and see the colorful remains of many a good time shared amongst friends. It’s a haven for bonding and inspiration, an elephant graveyard of many intoxicatingly happy nights on the beach.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">K</span>CSB<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>KCSB-91.1 FM, is UCSB’s radio station. Operated by student DJs and professionals, KCSB brings the Santa Barbara community quality programming all year long. It’s super easy to get involved: Watch out for news and fliers about orientation meetings and find out how to get your own show. Because it’s non-commercial, the range of music and other material the DJs explore through KCSB is always eclectic and unique.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">L</span>ocal Bands<br>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n<p>Although electronic dance music (EDM) is the more popular music genre in Isla Vista, it’s not too hard to find other styles and even live music. Just this past year, I.V.’s relatively small music scene featured a jazzy-funk and hip-hop band, a few reggae bands and a few punk bands. The best part? The shows are usually free and everyone is welcome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51244\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51244\" data-attachment-id=\"51244\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/ucsb-to-restore-self-sustaining-habitat/immigrants-william-zhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Immigrants-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1367951488\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"85\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Immigrants William Zhou\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Immigrants-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Immigrants-William-Zhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-51244\" alt=\"Award-winning actress and playwright Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni performing her one-woman play, “One Drop of Love: A Daughter’s Search for Her Father’s Racial Approval” at the MCC.

Almost every night, the MCC Theater is home to an interesting screening, dance performance, reading, Q&amp;A, open mic … and the list goes on! It is also an invaluable presence on campus for students of color and other underrepresented groups, and for anyone hoping to expand his or her worldview.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">M</span>usic Library<br>\n</strong></strong></p>\n<p>The Music Library just might be the most underrated place at UCSB. It has musical scores, books, videos, CDs and vinyls. Students aren’t allowed to take the CDs and vinyl out of the building, but can listen to them in personal listening rooms. These listening rooms are also a great place to study, especially during finals when the Davidson Library is packed. The Music Library is located on the second floor of the Arts Library (across from the UCen).</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">N</span>ational Geographic Live! Series<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>You know how there’s that one person in your family who is always out in the Caribbean or swimming with elephants or something? That’s how Artsweek likes to think of the photographers and explorers in the National Geographic Live! Series brought to us by A&amp;L (see: A) — they’re the cool aunts and uncles who always have a good story to tell. This year, three photographers and one underwater explorer come to Campbell Hall to chit chat about surviving flesh-eating parasites and irritated grizzly bears, discovering the secret lives of birds of paradise in the New Guinea forest, hanging out with geishas in Japan and swimming in the ruins of the Titanic.<strong><br>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">O</span>pen Mic Nights</strong></strong></p>\n<p>Open mics are a great way to meet people and witness local talent in the Isla Vista and Santa Barbara community, and are an even greater way to broadcast your own! You can see comedians, singers, rappers, poets and all manner of musical instruments at these popular free events. Open mic dates and times often change quarter to quarter but keep an eye out for events put on by the MultiCultural Center (see: M), ASPB (see: A), and other groups and venues. College crowds are often receptive and full of energy, making performing fun. It’s also fun to just go and watch performances. Open mic nights at Gio’s (Giovanni’s) on Pardall get packed though, so be sure to come early!</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">P</span>rogram Board, Associated Students<br>\n</strong>This A.S.-funded crew puts together shows, movies and miscellaneous events constantly. Free movies are screened at I.V. Theater on Tuesdays, and every Wednesday some raw local band performs at Storke Plaza at noon. ASPB uses The Hub (see: H) as its club-like venue. Spring quarter you’ll probably find a giant bounce house looking thing inhabiting the lagoon lawn with a long line of people waiting to get in. This is the Luminarium sponsored by ASPB, and it’s worth the long line. And the smell of the lagoon.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">R</span><b>ebelution</b></strong></p>\n<p>Reggae band Rebelution is a true demonstration of the kind of art that comes out of Isla Vista. Formed in 2004, the group won Battle of the Bands in 2006 and got to perform alongside Pepper and E-40. Nowadays they’re a touring crew, charting billboard top hits with their carefree tunes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51898\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51898\" data-attachment-id=\"51898\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/51894/quent/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/quent-e1377870651262.jpg?fit=610%2C719&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"610,719\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"quent\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/quent-e1377870651262.jpg?fit=212%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/quent-e1377870651262.jpg?fit=610%2C719&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-51898\" alt=\"Quentin Tarantino speaking at the SBIFF 2013.

The festival plays host to actors, actresses and filmmakers contending for the Academy Awards, and is known to foreshadow the winners of Best Picture and Best Actor/Actress. Think of it as your passport to seeing celebrities like <b>Jennifer Lawrence</b>, <b>Quentin Tarantino</b> and <b>Amy Adams</b> (just a few of 2013’s guests), plus a neat ticket to a wide array of films shown at the oldest and most historic theaters on State Street. The best part? It’s pretty easy to get involved in the festival as an usher, merch seller or even a reporter on the red carpet if you think writing for Artsweek might be in your future ….</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">S</span><b>poken Word</b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Spoken word is a big deal on this campus. There is a strong community of performers ranging from comedians to poets who hit up open mics (see: <b>O</b>) and ASPB’s yearly poetry showcase. These performers are some of the best of any college campus. The biggest reason for this is Prof. Kip Fulbeck’s Art Studio class, “Art 137: Spoken Word.” The class’s quarterly shows at the MCC Theater are legendary, and always packed, but to truly understand why you’ll have to check them out for yourself. Prof. Fulbeck, ASPB, and the MCC also bring out a range of spectacular artists every year. <b>Beau Sia</b>, <b>Anis Mojgani</b>, <b>Saul Williams</b> and <b>Mayda del Valle</b> are just a few who have graced our campus in the last three years.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">T</span><b>heater/Theatre</b></strong></p>\n<p>There are many types of theater/theatres on campus and throughout Santa Barbara. There’s the <b>Theater &amp; Dance Department</b>, which puts on innovative plays and moving dance performances throughout the year with the help of our BFA acting and dance students. There’s the <b>Pollock Theater</b>, a beautiful building that plays host to ritzy film screenings, often followed by equally ritzy free wine and cheese. Off campus, there’s <b>I.V. Theater</b> (free or near-free film screenings) and the Arlington Theatre (host to A&amp;L and SBIFF events). There’s also the <b>Lobero Theatre</b>, one of the oldest, most haunted buildings in Santa Barbara (also currently under construction but it will open with its usual season of music and more in December). The <b>Granada Theater</b> is another beautiful old building on State St. in the heart of downtown, and is home to operas, orchestras and more. Finally, for lovers of “the Theater”, local writers and actors put on fantastic stage shows regularly at <b>Center Stage Theater</b>, as well as the <b>Garvin Theatre </b>and <b>Jurkowitz Theatre</b>, both which were reopened in 2012.</p>\n<p><strong>1st </strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">T</span><b>hursday, Downtown</b></strong></p>\n<p>On the first Thursday of every month, galleries and shops downtown from the Funk Zone (see: <b>F)</b> TO State St. open their doors and celebrate new art exhibitions and fantastic performances with free wine and cheese. Check out our calendar for listings or just wander downtown on the 1st Thursday of each month to see what you can find!</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">U</span><b>niversity</b><b> Art Museum</b></strong></p>\n<p>The Art, Design &amp; ArchitectureMuseum at UCSB is a great place to visit for art and art history lovers. Adjacent to the UniversityCenter, the museum is located in the heart of campus and is a free resource where students can stop by any time to view current exhibitions. Exhibits range from private donor collections to work done by artists from the Master of Fine Arts program on campus and are alternated every few months. Exhibits are curated by museum staff and student interns who are interested in pursuing a career in curation and museum management. The museum is open Wednesday through Sunday from 12 p.m.-5 p.m. and admission is free.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">V</span><b>agina Monologues</b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Every February, female students in the Theater and Dance Department put on the Vagina Monologues. The episodic play written by Eve Ensler brings empowerment to women in an open dialogue on topics such a sex, rape and menstruation. The play is both insightful and comical and is a fun way to support female clubs on campus!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51632\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51632\" data-attachment-id=\"51632\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-30/wordstock-hits-its-stride-in-second-year/img_4700/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_4700-e1369957195553.jpg?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.4\",\"credit\":\"Picasa\",\"camera\":\"Canon PowerShot SX50 HS\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369483824\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"4.3\",\"iso\":\"80\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.001\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4700\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_4700-e1369957195553.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_4700-e1369957195553.jpg?fit=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-51632\" alt=\"WORD\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_4700-1024x767.jpg?resize=610%2C456\" width=\"610\" height=\"456\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-51632\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">WORD is an IV arts and culture magazine.                                                                                <em>Daily Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">W</span><b>ord Magazine</b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To all you kids who ruled high school yearbook and don’t want to lose your InDesign/PhotoShop skills like the Spanish you tried mastering (Four years of Spanish and all I can say is gracias.

Here’s the gist: Class meets on Fridays from 3-5 p.m. You work with 20-something other equally inspired students for 10 weeks to create a magazine that erupts with Isla Vista arts, culture, recipes and A-grade design and photography.

Every spring quarter A.S. Program Board works their tails off to make this event a smashing hello to summer. Last year <b>Kendrick Lamar, Dada Life, J-Boog, The Growlers</b>, and Battle of the Bands winners <b>Alpha Phunk</b> rocked the stage, while students took in interactive art installations, food vendors and an acrobat perched on a twenty foot high swing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">Y</span><b>oga </b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yeah, we know what you’re thinking — “yoga is recreational, not an art.” And I guess it’s not an art, strictly speaking. But here’s what you don’t know about yoga: It’s one of the best ways to unleash creative energy and make it pulsate out of your veins. Plus it makes you look good. And a bunch of artists who you wouldn’t guess did yoga utilize it for its magic creative energy/healthy powers. Among the list is <b>Eminem </b>(yep, Slim Shady does downward dog), <b>Chris Martin</b> (lead singer of <b>Coldplay </b>likes it too) and — wait for it — <b>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter</b> (yoga workouts are the reason for her body, apparently). If Beyoncé uses yoga for creative inspiration and her rockin’ booty, we suggest you jump on that bandwagon real quick.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366; font-size: xx-large;\">Z</span><b>aytoon</b></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Not exactly an art thing either, but this Lebanese restaurant off State Street is a sweet hang-out spot when you get sick of DLG tacos. The restaurant itself very clearly used to be someone’s house, and the back patio has been transformed into this amazing secret garden-esque hideaway. Twinkly lights dangle from trees, fire pits with glowing blue coals are centered in tables and a nice man plays guitar on Sunday nights. Belly dancers show up on Saturdays, and a Spanish band named <b>Vientos del Sur</b> plays contemporary music on Wednesdays. Food is scrumptious (beef shawarma is highly recommended) and hookah is encouraged for dessert. Yelp it if you’re interested in fine dining, great ambience or late night waterpipe sessions with good friends.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Natalie O’Brien — banjo enthusiast, Cajé patron, assistant art director of <i>Nexus</i>, editor of <i>The Catalyst</i></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51894\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/51894/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51894\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/51894/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/51894/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/51894/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-30/51894/","id":3481,"author":{"id":331,"name":"Demi Anter"},"related":[3480,3479,3478],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/331"}},"__N_SSG":true}
