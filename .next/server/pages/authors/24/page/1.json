The lawsuit states that Balter, through his blog posts and </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbalter/status/1208445918393065477\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several</span></a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbalter/status/1268963951481675782\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from his Twitter account, has interfered with Kurin’s career prospects and tenure application.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his first blog post about Kurin and Gomez Choque in February, Balter reported that Gomez Choque sexually harassed students from UCSB and other universities during a summer field school in Peru 2015, according to Title IX documents; he added that Kurin then retaliated against students involved in a subsequent 2016 Title IX case filed against Gomez Choque and Kurin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To report this, Balter obtained a copy of a 2016 Title IX case filed against both Gomez Choque and Kurin under the California Public Records Act and interviewed numerous witnesses of Gomez Choque and Kurin’s alleged actions at the field school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kurin reached a settlement with UCSB over the Title IX investigation in 2016, according to David Scher, Kurin’s lawyer in the lawsuit. University spokesperson Andrea Estrada declined to comment because the university “is not a party to that lawsuit.” Casey Walsh, an anthropology professor and chair of the department, did not respond to multiple requests for comment about both Kurin’s Title IX investigation and the lawsuit.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Dr. Kurin is not a perfect individual. She made some mistakes a few years ago and has apologized for them, acknowledged them, took responsibility for her actions and completed a settlement with the university that everybody was happy with,” Scher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scher confirmed that Kurin was charged with “sustained charges” by the Title IX office in 2016, meaning that the claims of misconduct by both Kurin and Gomez Choque were found to be substantiated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Balter’s blog posts, UCSB placed Kurin on a three-year suspension from Spring 2016 to Fall 2019. While on suspension, Kurin ran a summer field school in Peru with Gomez Choque and during the 2018 program, Gomez Choque allegedly sexually assaulted a student, Balter reported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada declined to confirm whether Kurin had been placed on suspension. The lawsuit states that b</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">etween 2016 and 2018, Kurin “engaged in the UCSB disciplinary process and utilizing the proper forums available to her as a professor, she amicably settled the matter with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB in March 2018.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scher said that Kurin was on leave, which he says she took “of her own account partly,” between 2016 and 2019, “as a way to resolve the case so that the university could be satisfied that she was going to do what she needed to do to come back to the university in good standing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kurin’s lawsuit alleges that in reporting about the Title IX investigation and Kurin’s suspension, “Balter acted with overt malice, hatred, and ill will towards Kurin.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’s trying to destroy her. He’s trying to prevent her from getting tenure. That’s what he’s doing. That is why we filed this lawsuit,” Scher told the Nexus over Zoom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not all false,” he said, referring to Balter’s reporting, “but a lot of it is dramatically exaggerated and we cannot take it anymore. We’re tired of it. He just needs to stop and go away so that Dr. Kurin can go before the tenure board truthfully, honestly, with actual facts.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit states that Balter’s blogs “repeatedly demand that Kurin not be granted tenure and that she otherwise be banned from any kind of gainful employment.” The lawsuit points to instances from Balter’s past as evidence of a pattern of misconduct, including negative Amazon reviews of </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Goddess-Bull-Catalhoyuk-Archaeological-Civilization/dp/1598740695/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;qid=1594356393&amp;refinements=p_27%3AMichael+Balter&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a book</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Balter wrote in 2009 called “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Goddess and the Bull: Catalhoyuk–An Archaeological Journey to the Dawn of Civilization,”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which centered around an archaeological dig. The lawsuit says the book focuses more on “who [the archeologists] hooked up with and when.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit describes Balter’s dismissal from his former job at Science Magazine, alleging it was for “misconduct” and a “serious breach of trust,” both of which Balter denied on his blog, on social media and when speaking to the Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said his dismissal from Science Magazine was due to a “longstanding mutual breakdown of trust” and that Kurin “cherry-picked negative things about my book.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She was basically trying to paint me out as being somebody who maybe knew nothing about archaeology and who was constantly getting fired from jobs that I actually really was not fired from,” Balter said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One part of this case centers around Balter’s wording in his reporting, in which he frequently describes Kurin being found “guilty” of retaliation by a Title IX investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said that he used the word “guilty” in the colloquial sense, not a legal sense, while Scher said that Balter’s use of the word implies that Kurin was convicted of a crime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Title IX charged her [with] sustained charges. Sustaining charges does not mean guilty,” but instead means that the claims in the Title IX case against both Gomez Choque and Kurin were found to be substantiated, Scher said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said he stands by his use of the word “guilty” and won’t retract his blog posts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not apologizing for the word guilty …  And I think that they can’t win the case on that; in the colloquial sense of the word, she was found guilty of misconduct by Title IX,” Balter said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada said that “the University investigates all reports of alleged misconduct by faculty” but could not comment on specific cases. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit cites Balter’s social media posts as evidence that he acted with overt malice against Kurin and knowingly published false statements against her, such as reporting that Kurin attempted to cover up Gomez Choque’s alleged misconduct and refused to cooperate with the Title IX investigation. In those posts, Balter called on UCSB and the anthropology department to not give Kurin tenure, according to the lawsuit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter argues he has a First Amendment right to post his opinions on his blog and social media, including those encouraging UCSB to not give Kurin tenure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have said openly and publicly that I do not believe Danielle Kurin should be given tenure, because I think that her misconduct shows that she cannot be trusted around students,” Balter said. “I’m entitled to have an opinion under the First Amendment about what the result of all this should be.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said he carries no malice toward Kurin because he had never heard of her before he began reporting on her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I haven’t made up any stories about Danielle Kurin. I haven’t said anything about her that I don’t firmly believe to be true based on my own reporting,” Balter said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter has until Aug. 15 to respond to the lawsuit, less than a month before Kurin’s tenure review is scheduled to begin. Scher said he plans to update the lawsuit with more examples of Balter’s alleged overt malice toward Kurin in an amended filing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balter said he is looking for a First Amendment lawyer to take on his case, but said he is confident that his reporting and social media posts are protected under the law. He has also created a </span><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/freedom-of-the-press-defense-fund-kurin-v-balter\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GoFundMe</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cover upcoming legal expenses and has since raised over $3,700 as of July 11. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I reported the truth. I reported it faithfully. I reported it in good faith. I am not guilty of defamation by a long shot,” he said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Perhaps not to solve them and not to solve them single handedly, but to be fully engaged in finding solutions,” Drake said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic Senate Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani said that Drake will “steer the UC into a bold new era,” and lauded his experience in handling “budgetary challenges, issues of health and healthcare, racism and inclusion [and] policing and security.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Michael Drake’s commitment to graduate and undergraduate students, to the work of faculty, to understanding the centrality of all UC employees along with his very deep commitment to social mobility, is a joy to encounter.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drake attended Stanford University as an undergraduate, then received a medical degree from UC San Francisco. He served as the fifth chancellor of UC Irvine from 2005 to 2014 and the president of The Ohio State University from 2014 to the present. Drake is also board of governors chairman of the NCAA and a board member for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, according to the UC press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regent Sherry Lansing — vice chair of the presidential search committee — said the competition for the position was steep, but Drake stood above his contenders for his history of innovation and commitment to diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the things that was very important to us is somebody who’s ready on day one and Michael brings that quality because of his familiarity with UC,” she said. “When you look at what he did as chancellor [of UC Irvine] and at all the other jobs he had at Ohio State, you see that Michael is bold and he is capable of thinking outside of the box.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Drake’s “illustrious” career in education and a public announcement of retirement, Lansing said she was surprised that he took the position, but amounts it to Drake’s history with the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think he’s doing this job simply because he loves UC.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

a sense of isolation that comes with living over 5,000 miles away from his school. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for Tom Huang, a first-year electrical engineering student from China, and many other international students, that decision meant choosing between his home at UC Santa Barbara or his home an ocean away.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huang said he was faced with either staying in California for the remainder of the quarter — knowing he’d be separated from his family during a pandemic —  or moving back to Shanghai, where he would face two weeks of mandatory isolation and a 15-hour time difference for lectures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of winter quarter, Huang said he decided to return home, mainly because of safety concerns he had with staying in the U.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think the situation in China is recovering, especially because I’m not from Wuhan. I’m from Shanghai and all the city is actually dealing with it pretty well. My dad resumed working in mid-February and we know that the peak is already passed,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do believe it is safer in China than the U.S. It’s not even a government problem. People in the U.S. don’t even have the awareness to wear a mask or anything like that. So I felt a bit concerned [staying in the U.S.].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students at UCSB have faced a unique set of difficulties in keeping up with coursework during the coronavirus pandemic. The switch to remote learning forced students to quickly decide whether to stay in Santa Barbara or go to their home countries, a hardship that domestic students did not have to navigate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-19/majority-of-fall-quarter-classes-to-be-held-remotely-tuition-and-student-fees-will-not-change/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB recently unveiled its plan for hybrid instruction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Fall Quarter 2020, some uncertainty still looms for international students, whose options for the upcoming quarter make the decision between home and UCSB more complicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email outlining fall quarter protocols, Chancellor Henry T. Yang announced that all first-year international students will have the option to continue with remote curriculum “sufficient for full-time status,” and that “any student who wishes to continue with a full remote offering may do so without being present on or near campus.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many international students are unsure whether they can get visas renewed to re-enter the U.S., or if coming to the U.S. is the safest option, according to Hak Zheng, a second-year physics major in the College of Creative Studies, currently back home in Japan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I bought a one-way ticket because I’m so uncertain about when I can come back,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m actually not sure if I wanted to come back right now if I’m able to. They might not be allowing any non-citizen people to come in [to the U.S.].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng said it was “obvious” for him to go back to Japan instead of “being by myself in I.V.” He tentatively plans to come back to the U.S. for fall quarter, even if his classes are all online. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If fall quarter is still online but the U.S. lets me come back inside, I might consider coming back, just because I do feel like my productivity is low here, so I might decide that I’ve had enough time with my family, now I’m gonna go back to my school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College students across the country, while disconnected from campus and tuning in to lectures over Zoom, have shifted to a “new normal” over the past few months. This adjustment is even greater for international students, who are trying to keep up with classes in a different time zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students who have chosen to move back home have had to, in some cases, attend lectures and take exams in the middle of the night or early morning. While some professors chose to hold asynchronous classes over the past quarter — which international students could attend to on their own time — there was limited flexibility when it came to exams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng had Zoom lectures at 5 a.m. twice a week for one class and had to take the midterm and final exams at 3 a.m. for another class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students who stayed in the U.S. have their normal time and normal schedule, but we have to do this weird scheduling thing, so the score is not a good reflection of where we are. I don’t know if any professors are going to take that into consideration at all, but that’s just something I’m a little concerned about,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think we as human beings need that strict sleep schedule to operate well. I feel like I’m less energetic than usual. But I’m seeing it as something that I just have to deal with for this quarter, hopefully only this quarter, but who knows.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time zone difference between California and home proved to be a major factor in some international students’ decision to remain in the U.S. To avoid the time difference, Aimee Wang — a third-year sociology major from China — decided to stay at a friend’s house in Rancho Cucamonga this quarter after moving out of her sorority house. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang ran a successful Associated Students Senate campaign for a College of Letters and Science seat, becoming the first international student elected as senator.  But the demands of the job, from running for her seat to beginning her duties at the end of the quarter, meant moving back to China would have been a “huge hassle,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My friends that I’ve spoken with said they’re not going back to China over the summer because, right now, when we go back, we have to quarantine ourselves,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So it’s kind of a very long process to go back, then spend almost a month [quarantining] by yourself. That may be half of a normal summer break, just to come back to the U.S. and you’d probably have to quarantine yourself again.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another obstacle for students moving back to China in particular is that they have to use a virtual private network (VPN) for internet access, which Wang said can be very slow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For international students in China, </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/major-us-tech-companies-blocked-from-operating-in-china-2019-5\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">students cannot access Google </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or any affiliated websites like Google Docs due to restrictions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have two other CCS physics students who I’m pretty close with, they’re both from China and they did both decided to stay [in the U.S.], and the main reason for them was that they had to deal with the firewall and probably more restrictions in China,” Zheng said, adding that it was a “50-50” split between friends of his who decided to stay in California and who decided to leave. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zheng also said there’s been a sense of isolation that comes with living over 5,000 miles away from his school and his peers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do feel disconnected from my friends, most of my friends are in the United States, so I mean, they call and they would do homework together, so sometimes they’ll be calling while I’m sleeping, so I do notice that I connect with them a lot less than when I’m back in school,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a huge difference between trying to connect with a person through a video call than hanging out in person.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main uncertainty that lies ahead for Wang is fall quarter’s hybrid scenario. She said she’ll be staying in I.V. regardless of whether courses are conducted remotely or not because she wants to experience her senior year there. But she added that a concern for many international students is paying international tuition while missing out on in-person educational benefits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For out-of-state and international students, we pay a lot more for tuition. With the whole online situation, all these changes are already unfair for all the students, but I think it’s even more unfair for international students and out-of-states.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huang said he doesn’t know exactly when he’ll be back in the U.S. But of all the challenges he’s faced this quarter, he said the most difficult and ongoing challenge is the uncertainty that lies ahead for his education. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not saying I’m worried about living or anything like that, but mostly learning. Really what most of us are worried about is being able to come back to the U.S. in the fall.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tonight’s agenda included a hefty 17 bills and resolutions, a high number in part because all bills and resolutions from last week were pushed after the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-21/swearing-in-of-71st-a-s-senate-a-s-executives-overshadowed-by-recall-fight-against-president-beasley-zoombombing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">meeting’s abrupt end due to Zoombombing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to pass the remaining bills — which had to have been tabled for a week before being voted on — the Senate must hold two more meetings before the end of the quarter. The Senate now plans to meet this Friday at 11 a.m. to vote on the agenda for tonight’s meeting, and again on May 3 at 6 p.m. to vote on tabled bills, pending the approval of Dean of Student Life and Assistant Vice Chancellor Katya Armistead to hold a meeting during Week 10. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a regular Senate term, Week 9 of spring quarter is the last meeting of the year before the summer break; due to Zoombombings, the 71st Senate has not been able to hold a full meeting or vote on any resolutions since the new senators were sworn in.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tonight’s meeting began just after 6:30 p.m., but was stalled as White had difficulty navigating Zoom during the meeting. After Off-Campus Senator Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan motioned to approve all 2020-21 year appointments, with the exception of Attorney General Tyler Barth and those within the Internal Vice President’s (IVP) office, a debate broke out about when to discuss the appointments that had not been pushed through.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After running into problems with voting without the Zoom poll feature, White created a new Zoom link to include the feature. However, immediately after participants joined the new link, multiple Zoombombers disrupted the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One Zoombomber loudly shouted, “Fuck you, fuck you dirty bitch.” Others displayed obscene media, including a video of someone appearing to masturbate on camera. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, White muted all participants’ microphones and created a separate Zoom breakout room for the senators to discuss how to handle the rest of the meeting. As senators discussed options, approximately 40 people remained in the main meeting room, where Zoombombers continued to show obscene photos as their images. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once senators realized the disturbances were ongoing, White told senators she would make a new link — the third of the night — to be shared only with the senators and Associated Students (A.S.) staff. A.S. Legislative Liaison Holly Mayes then ended the original meeting without warning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senators then met for over an hour in a private Zoom call to discuss when to hold future meetings and what precautions should be taken in light of the Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the last meeting, the senators had thrown around a handful of ideas about how to conduct secure, but public, Zoom meetings. Moving forward, meetings will now be held as Zoom webinars, where only panelists are visible and able to speak, as opposed to anyone in the meeting, according to White. For public forum, individuals will be enabled as panelists when it is their turn to talk, and then will be removed as panelists after speaking in order to prevent future Zoombombings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To alleviate technical difficulties in executing the new webinar system at the next meeting, senators plan to meet 30 minutes before the meeting on Friday to run through the new format.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During tonight’s private meeting, senators also began working on a public statement to address the Zoombombings and the abrupt ending to the regular meeting. White said the Senate plans to publish the statement tomorrow afternoon. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

week</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by UC President Janet Napolitano, follows the path of a number of institutions across the country that have gone </span><a

As the largest university system in the nation to eliminate the test, the UC’s decision will likely have a ripple effect across the country, according to the Board of Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 2025 onward, California applicants will be judged by a new testing standard to assess knowledge that “better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC’s values,” Napolitano’s report read. No decision has been made yet for out-of-state and international students, who might continue using the SAT and ACT or be judged by the UC’s future standardized test assessment, the details of which have yet to be determined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a new test has not been implemented by 2025, the testing requirement for California students will be eliminated altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We need to move in a careful and studied way to the new future for the University … a better test should be what we aim for in California,” Napolitano told the Regents, saying one goal in the creation of a new test is to help strengthen college preparedness in California high schools. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We also want to work …  to analyze and drill down into factors that contribute to disproportionate representation, or rather underrepresentation, of students from underserved communities in our population. We are a public university after all,” Napolitano told the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/uc-relaxes-admission-requirements-due-to-coronavirus-related-challenges/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and 2022 application cycles, the SAT and ACT will be optional. This is partially due to the cancellation of tests due to the coronavirus but extends the optional period to two years instead of the original one-year extension as approved by the Regents in March. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2023 and 2024 application cycles, admissions will be “test blind.” Students may submit an SAT or ACT score for reasons other than admissions, such as “course placement, certain scholarships, and eligibility for the statewide admissions guarantee,” where students across the state with top scores are guaranteed admission to a UC, according to Napolitano’s recommendation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano acknowledged that the new testing assessment might draw on other standardized tests. In her comments, she mentioned that the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC), an 11th grade standardized test already used in California and other states, could be fitted for college admission testing in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was debate among the regents over whether to continue use of the ACT and SAT while a new test was in the works, a similar line of reasoning to that of the Academic Senate’s Standardized Testing Task Force </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report to the Regents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February, where the task force recommended keeping the ACT and SAT in place until a replacement test is finalized.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/06/groups-demand-university-california-stop-using-satact-scores-admissions-alleging-tests-discriminate-against-underprivileged-students/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-20/is-sat-test-going-down-at-uc-several-uc-regents-express-deep-skepticism-over-use-in-admissions-process\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">critics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the years have shared the attitude that both income and race are indicators of success on standardized tests, with an industry developing around years-long preparation and some beginning as early as middle school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/california-groups-demand-uc-drop-the-sat-saying-they-illegally-discriminate-against-disadvantaged-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed lawsuits</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the UC to eliminate the test in admissions.

I knew that this job is not being done right,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So I came in with a plan and I think I executed it to the best of my abilities; setting deadlines, setting expectations, getting everyone trained. And in regard to that, I think I did quite a good job,” she continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most noticeable shift between Adam and her predecessor, Steven Ho, was their efficiency during meetings. It was rare for a meeting to go past 10 p.m. for the 70th senate, with brief to little discussion for the vast majority of resolutions. Adam attributes this to a greater understanding of meetings through training on authoring resolutions and more emphasis on the “behind the scenes” work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was a senator, so many amendments were being made [in]to bills and resolutions the [same] night we were discussing them. And I just thought that was ridiculous,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that if there were any problems with Legal Code or if a resolution was on a sensitive subject, she would meet with the authors beforehand to avoid a “whole drama-fest.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Wednesday night meetings were just the tip of the iceberg. A lot of the work was beforehand [and] behind the scenes and that’s why the meetings ran so smoothly,” Adam said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If you were going to put forward a bill or a resolution, it should be pretty clean by the time you submit it to the IVP, and the IVP should be reading each one, as I did, to make sure it followed Legal Code,” she added.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that behind the scenes work happens away from public view, which some said made for a lack of transparency to the senators’ constituency. Adam, however, said doing the hard work behind doors provided the “best result” for senators and their constituents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Why would we show them something sloppy and controversial and that is divisive? If senators are representatives of the public and they can agree on something, then yeah, the public should be able to agree as well using that logic,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam says a lot of the work that went into the Senate’s resolutions was “pretty internal and administrative,” with many updates to the legal codes of Boards, Commissions and Units (BCUs), the student organizations that are within Associated Students (A.S.). Adam called these Legal Code changes “tangible effects” that reflect senators’ better relationships with BCUs than in years prior.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Adam began her term, there were </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/a-s-senate-fills-three-vacancies/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three vacancies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Senate: two on-campus senators and one College of Creative Studies Senator, a position that had been vacant for two years. Adam appointed an ad-hoc committee to fill them, and the positions were filled by October. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam called the appointments a “team effort,” a theme mirrored throughout many of her accomplishments across the year. This took shape through the solid working relationships she built with her first pro tempore and second pro tempore — Off-Campus Senator Tianna White and On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman, respectively. Adam said the strong relationships allowed her to delegate some responsibilities meant for IVP to them, such as attending certain meetings on her behalf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite not making it to every meeting, Adam said she made herself available through daily office hours and email when she couldn’t be present physically.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transparency and availability in A.S. posed a challenge this spring with a </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but Adam led the Senate’s shift to weekly Zoom meetings — what she described as a “touch and go situation” — and deemed that the transition was a success. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that that during her term as a senator she felt “pretty deflated within A.S.,” but in the end believes that she cut through a lot of noise to improve the association through her work as both a senator and IVP.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I kind of changed the reputation of the Senate, that’s what I would boil it down to, to being much more student serving, much more respectful of each other, much more productive and much more professional.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for next year, with her first pro tempore White filling her shoes as IVP, Adam said she plans to stay in Santa Barbara.<br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really excited to stay in the area and maybe I’ll come back to a Senate meeting or two. You never know.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Now, Title IX will only apply to sexual violence that occurs in university-owned off-campus buildings or “any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a postsecondary institution,” such as a fraternity or sorority house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university owns and leases a handful of apartment buildings in Isla Vista, as well as 910 Embarcadero Del Mar, the site of Dublin’s Sports Grill and Precious Slut Tattoo Parlor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that the “vast majority” of gender-based violence cases that C.A.R.E. sees occur in off-campus housing in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m really concerned that there’s going to be cases that would have been eligible for Title IX [that] will no longer be eligible for those investigations,” Conway said in a phone interview. “But [I.V. is] just one less area that offenders can be accountable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, survivors of sexual assault can still report to local law enforcement such as the UC Police Department or the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, or seek counseling from organizations like C.A.R.E., but will not be able to report the incident to the Title IX office if the sexual assault took place in I.V., Conway said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, while university-sanctioned fraternity and sorority houses are officially recognized buildings within Title IX’s scope, the new regulations leave areas like fraternity satellite houses out of the university’s jurisdiction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The new regulations] wouldn’t include those spaces … That’s really dangerous for our community, especially because we have so much off-campus housing that is not owned by the university,” said Alia Reynolds, the director of Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Board President Spencer Brandt said that the jurisdiction restrictions are a “ridiculous standard” that will impact safety in I.V.; the I.V. CSD board </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-15/i-v-csd-condemns-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protested the amendments in a letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> submitted to the Department of Education during the public comment period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you create a policy that requires the university to sort of draw a line around the areas where they have jurisdiction to investigate sexual violence and which areas that they do not, you are, by definition, discouraging survivors from coming forward and using the judicial tools that should be at their disposal to seek justice,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations also narrow the definition of sexual violence as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access” — a definition first established by the 1999 Supreme Court case</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which had not previously been used as Title IX’s definition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, under Obama-era policy, an incident had to be either severe, pervasive or objectively offensive to qualify as sexual harassment; under the new regulations, an incident must be considered all three in order to be under the umbrella of sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds said that the change from “or” to “and” may seem small, but the language change makes a large difference in what may be considered sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That would essentially mean that the instance [of sexual violence] — because it has to be severe and pervasive and objectively offensive — has to happen more than one time, which is the definition of pervasive. So it excludes a lot of instances of sexual harassment [with] this new definition,” Reynolds explained. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710641/PACAOS-Appendix-E\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the UC Title IX policy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, first-time occurences of dating violence, stalking and domestic violence are still included in the definition of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, universities will have to choose a universal evidentiary standard for handling sexual assault, either with the preponderance of the evidence standard or with the clear and convincing evidence standard for all cases. Previously, schools could use different standards in different cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The preponderance of evidence standard requires that there is a 50.1% chance that the charges are true, while the clear and convincing evidence standard requires a higher threshold of 75.1%, according to Conway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Systemwide Title IX Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding which standard the university will use moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colleges and universities are also no longer required to designate most employees, such as professors or staff, as “mandatory reporters,” meaning they will no longer be required to report an incident of sexual violence to the Title IX office if they are informed of it. Instead, schools must now decide “which of their employees must, may, or must only with a student’s consent, report sexual harassment to the recipient’s Title IX Coordinator,” according to the new regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds believes the change will lower the amount of cases reported but said that in her opinion, this particular addition to the Title IX policy isn’t entirely negative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some individuals disclose an instance of sexual assault to someone that they didn’t realize was a mandated reporter. And then those instances are reported and they wish they hadn’t been,” Reynolds explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But mandatory reporters are essential to connecting students to the C.A.R.E. office, Conway said. She’s worried that this change will erase the work of faculty in connecting students to the services C.A.R.E. offers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Just because you don’t have to report doesn’t mean it’s not the right thing to do to get that survivor connected with the resources and with an advocate,” Conway said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, colleges can no longer use the single-investigator model — in which an investigator writes a report and concludes the case, but no hearing takes place — to investigate an incident of sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under current California law, however, </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-california-universities-title-ix-20190215-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universities haven’t used the single-investigator model</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since January 2019. Prior to January 2019, hearings of Title IX cases in California were conducted only in the appeal process, by either the complainant or the respondent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new regulations permit live cross-examination of the complainant and the respondent by advisers and lawyers, but prohibits complainants and respondents from questioning each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This marks a significant change from DeVos’ initial proposed policy in November 2018, which did allow for students to cross-examine each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conway said that a downside to the hearing method, rather than the single-investigator method, is that cases will take longer to conclude, which, along with the additional trauma of a cross-examination, could further deter students from reporting. Conway said that while more students are accessing C.A.R.E. accessing than ever, she has already seen fewer C.A.R.E. clients choosing to go through the Title IX investigation process since the 2019 change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since DeVos’ announcement, several groups across the country have already pledged to fight the regulations in court, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/betsy-devos-announces-new-rules-on-campus-sexual-assault-offering-more-rights-to-the-accused/2020/05/06/4d950c7c-8fa0-11ea-a9c0-73b93422d691_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Washington Post reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At UC Santa Barbara, student organizations have already started. Reynolds said that S.A.S.A. is working with Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit organization for gender justice, and that some S.A.S.A. members are part of a newly formed national coalition against sexual violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want to work with them to try to bolster that national coalition so we can fight this on the national level as well as on the state level.” </span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/12/2020, 09:21 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that a lower number of students accessing C.A.R.E. resources. This article has been corrected to state that more students are accessing C.A.R.E. resources, but fewer C.A.R.E. clients are choosing to go through Title IX investigation, according to Conway. </i></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\">\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

including UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ and UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive — who are advocating for the elimination of the ACT and SAT in admissions. As the idea gained traction in recent years, </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/10/18/record-number-colleges-drop-satact-admissions-requirement-amid-growing-disenchantment-with-standardized-tests/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">universities across the country</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have made testing optional or eliminated it altogether. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the proposal, the ACT and SAT would be optional for two years, with testing requirements eliminated completely for two years after that. Starting in 2025, a “modif[ied] or create[d] test that better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC’s values” will be used, according to the </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may20/b4.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">action item</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proposed for the May 21 meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC is unable to modify or create a new test in time for California freshmen applicants in 2025, Napolitano recommends that the UC suspend its testing requirements for California students altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recommendation specifies that the potential elimination of the ACT and SAT after 2025 only applies to in-state students, and that the UC President will work with the Academic Senate to determine an approach for out-of-state and international students from 2025 onwards. Some potential options include having students take the same assessment as California students or continuing to accept their ACT and SAT scores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal follows the UC Academic Senate’s </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/uc-academic-senate-recommends-uc-admissions-continue-requiring-standardized-testing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comprehensive proposal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in February, which found that current standardized testing procedures may be a factor in the underrepresentation of minority groups at UC schools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, while the Academic Senate’s Standardized Testing Task Force (STTF) laid out the need for a new testing method, it recommended that the UC continue mandatory testing for now, the opposite of Napolitano’s proposal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STTF’s report ultimately concluded that the UC uses standardized tests responsibly and appropriately. Academic Council Chair Kum-Kum Bhavnani wrote in an April </span><a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/may20/b4attach2.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">letter to the Regents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Academic Council disagreed with that assessment from the STTF.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents announced in March that Fall 2021 admissions would be </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-01/uc-relaxes-admission-requirements-due-to-coronavirus-related-challenges/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“test optional”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to the coronavirus pandemic, which Napolitano now recommends be continued until 2022. Those who don’t submit a score will not be put at a disadvantage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2023 and 2024, Napolitano recommends that UC admissions be “test blind,” where students can still submit a score, but it would be used for purposes other than selection, such as “course placement, certain scholarships, and eligibility for the statewide admissions guarantee,” where students across the state with top scores are guaranteed admission to a UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under Napolitano’s proposal, in a sixth-month process beginning in summer 2020 and ending in January 2021, the UC will identify or create a new test by consulting with K-12 educators, test experts, the California State University (CSU) and UC faculty to “construct a test better suited for the needs of UC” for fall 2025 applicants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Napolitano’s recommendation concurs with the STTF to eliminate the SAT Writing test, calling it “an unnecessary time and cost burden for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, one potential option noted by Napolitano is the Smarter Balanced Assessment (SBAC), an 11th grade standardized test already used in California and other states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STTF, however, recommended to Napolitano in its report that the UC not use the SBAC test, which they said is aligned to a different set of academic standards than the ACT and SAT. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Critics of the ACT and SAT argue that race and income are indicators of success on the test, and that inequitable access to test prep prevents low-income students and underrepresented minorities from getting high scores. Several groups have </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/california-groups-demand-uc-drop-the-sat-saying-they-illegally-discriminate-against-disadvantaged-students\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed lawsuits </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">against the UC to eliminate the tests in admissions, calling the tests biased.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advocates of the SAT and ACT </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-03/uc-should-keep-sat-and-act-as-admission-requirements-faculty-report-says\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">argue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that it is the only way to determine a student’s academic success across the state, as grading systems vastly differ from school to school. They also argue that the test is only one of fourteen factors in admissions — weighed less than high school grades — so changing the test would not make a significant impact on a student’s admission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents will discuss standardized testing in their board meeting on May 21, where they will look at Napolitano’s proposal and Academic Senate recommendations and vote on a plan for standardized testing moving forward.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

strike on Feb. 27, halting teaching and grading to advocate for a cost-of-living adjustment. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to submit the withheld grades follows that of striking UC Santa Cruz teaching assistants, who announced they would </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-29/uc-santa-cruz-cola-strikers-to-submit-withheld-fall-and-winter-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submit fall and winter quarter grades</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earlier this week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB teaching assistants started their strike on Feb. 27, halting teaching and grading to advocate for a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), a monthly stipend of $1,807.51 that would be given to all graduate students to alleviate rising housing costs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students were the last of any UC campus to continue withholding grades, with UCSC submitting earlier this week and other campuses like UC San Diego and UC Davis having been forced to submit grades in early April by campus administration under threat of disciplinary action. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email stated that the COLA movement at UCSB “has been ignored, disrespected, or patronized by an administration hoping this movement will wither and die” and explained that the Dean of Graduate Division wouldn’t negotiate with them and instead suggested they seek support at Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada was not immediately available for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 50 teaching assistants at UCSB were withholding grades prior to Thursday’s announcement, according to various COLA organizers. Graduate students initially expected this number to be higher, but the coronavirus pandemic and the shift to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> meant that teaching assistants who had second and third jobs outside the university were vulnerable to unemployment and were compelled to submit grades to secure their jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without foreclosing the withholding of Spring grades, we have made the difficult decision to end our Winter grade strike, and marshal our full strength behind building a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/uaw-2865-to-vote-to-strike-over-unfair-practice-charges-against-the-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">union-sanctioned unfair labor practice (ULP) strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of February, the UC Regents </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), a charge filed to the state when an employer or union violates the National Labor Relations Act. The Regents alleged that United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW) — the union representing UC teaching assistants, readers and tutors — supported wildcat strikes and failed to take action to end the strike, according to the charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs against the Regents, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, such as failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union and instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of collecting signatures for a ULP strike, which would be similar in nature to the wildcat strikes — teaching assistants would stop instruction and would withhold grades — but because it would be sanctioned by the union, strikers under UAW are guaranteed protections, according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The power to call a strike vote rests with UAW’s bargaining team, and UAW’s Joint Council told the bargaining team that it will recommend a strike vote once its <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ULP_Strike_Pledge\">strike pledge</a> reaches 5,000 signatures.

Yang and UCSB administration to address, which includes changing working conditions for graduate students under the coronavirus pandemic and greater transparency on how the $25 million in stimulus money allotted to UCSB by the federal government will be used. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers are “insisting” that some of this money go towards waiving or alleviating rent in UCSB-owned student and family housing, as well as rent assistance for graduate students living off-campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demands also call for a walk-back of all strike-related discipline and a commitment to non-retaliation against all UC wildcats, along with the “reinstatement of </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fired UCSC graduate student workers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for current and future appointments.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In adapting to these circumstances</span><b>, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our refocus on alleviating rent and healthcare burden carries on the philosophical core of the COLA demand: that people deserve access to healthcare, housing, and living wages.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the COLA movement — both at UCSB and UC-wide —  has ceased grade withholding for the time being, organizers are still moving forward with other actions. On Friday, COLA organizers UC-wide held a one-day general strike for International Workers’ Day against unsafe working conditions brought on by the coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers also wrote that the movement continues in a variety of formats online, and that it will continue in person once campuses are re-opened.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the pandemic passes and our campus reopens (and both these events </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> occur), we do not intend to return to business as usual,” the email read.</span></p>\n<p><i>Correction [5/02/2020, 10:05 p.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that UAW would not vote to strike until they reach 5,000 signatures on their strike pledge.

400;\">a policy change from the UCSC administration</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on April 10, which stated that all missing grades would change automatically to a “Pass” on students’ transcripts, meaning every student with missing grades would pass the class but not receive a letter grade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All missing grades will change automatically to a pass grade on May 1; after “Pass” grades have been entered, instructors have a year to change them to letter grades, according to a statement by the UCSC Committee on Educational Policy (CEP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked to comment, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) deferred comment to UCSC. After multiple attempts, UCSC was not immediately available for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students launched the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) movement in the fall, asking for a proposed monthly stipend of $1,412 to supplement teaching assistants’ (TA) salaries in the face of rising housing prices. Although the movement comes after years of organizing around the issue, UCSC graduate students officially went on a wildcat strike, meaning action without union support, on Dec. 9, 2019. Until now, they have refused to upload grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC Graduate Student Association President </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yulia Gilichinskaya criticized UCSC’s decision to change all missing grades to pass grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The administration has shifted the burden of missing grades from themselves and onto the undergraduates it purports to care for and educate. We cannot allow this,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that some of the students work really hard and really care about getting an A or getting a B. And so taking that away from students who have those grades when we have them, I think is unfair,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In exchange for submitting withheld grades, some graduate students who were </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dismissed from TA positions for spring quarter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be “considered for future appointments,” but Gilichinskaya said there are no guarantees of reinstatement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gilichinskaya</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, over 80 UCSC graduate students withheld grades during Fall Quarter 2019, which jumped to over 100 withholders by the end of Winter Quarter 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, around 80 UCSC graduate students who were dismissed from their spring TA positions are still without work, according to Gilichinskaya.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With UCSC graduate students now submitting grades before May 1, striking UCSB graduate students are the only grade withholders left in the UC system. UCSB </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/two-days-in-ucsb-cola-wildcat-strike-draws-close-to-2000-supporters/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">went on full strike</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Feb. 27,  meaning TAs ceased teaching and grading. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 55 UCSB graduate students are currently withholding winter quarter grades, according to Sheila Kulkarni, a chemistry and biochemistry Ph.D. student and the Recording Secretary for the UCSB unit of United Auto Workers 2865 (UAW), the union representing UC teaching assistants, readers and tutors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC graduate students are beginning to shift from withholding grades to pushing for UAW’s support in striking against </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/uaw-2865-to-vote-to-strike-over-unfair-practice-charges-against-the-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which are filed to the state when an employer or union violates the National Labor Relations Act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alleging that UAW supported wildcat strike efforts and failed to take action to end the strike, the UC Regents </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a ULP against UAW. Subsequently, UAW </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">filed</span></a> <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ULPs, alleging that the UC has committed multiple unfair labor practices in its response to the COLA movement, including failing to negotiate for a COLA with the union while instead bargaining with individual graduate students and groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to the current wildcat COLA strikes, potential backing from UAW in a strike against ULP charges would guarantee protections for striking graduate students, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to a </span><a href=\"https://payusmoreucsc.com/the-next-phase-of-the-cola-struggle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> published on April 1 by UCSC COLA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These protections are necessary certainties in these uncertain times. They will allow us to strike against the university with the full weight of our statewide union behind us,” the statement read.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A UAW-sanctioned strike would also shift the burden of withholding grades away from two campuses — UCSC and UCSB — toward a UC-wide approach at the union level by creating a system-wide strike, according to Gilichinskaya.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW’s bargaining team is in the process of obtaining signatures to allow a vote to decide on whether to strike over the ULP grievances. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TAs across the UC system are phone banking to help collect more signatures for the vote and , as of Monday, have obtained</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over 2,300 of the 5,000 in-unit signatures needed, according to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya’s email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilichinskaya said that grade withholding in future quarters will continue if a ULP strike is to occur, but until then, graduate students are losing their “biggest leverage” in the COLA strikes against UCOP to demand a living wage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Grades are what the university cares about. It doesn’t care about the quality of the education. It needs the grades for the bureaucracy to smoothly function,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Gilichinskaya said that due to the coronavirus pandemic — and the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-03-14/breaking-ucsb-to-extend-remote-instruction-through-spring-quarter/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">switch to remote learning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that came with it — the COLA movement lost vital momentum that came from in-person picket lines. But she foresees “statewide massive withholding of teaching and grading labor” in the event of a union-sanctioned ULP strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of people lost their second and third jobs. A lot of people weren’t as confident that they could risk their employment and their health insurance in the midst of a pandemic,” Gilichinskaya said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So this leverage sort of didn’t have as much strength just because we didn’t have the numbers at the end of winter quarter.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

This includes a tenant or family member being sick with coronavirus, a tenant being laid off or losing hours or a tenant having to miss work to look after their child. In Santa Barbara County, all K-12 schools are closed as a result of coronavirus, the </span><a href=\"https://www.independent.com/2020/03/13/santa-barbara-county-k-12-schools-closing-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, similar to other counties across the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid eviction, the tenant must provide their landlord with documentation that shows their inability to pay rent, such as an employment termination notice or a bank statement, according to the executive order. Additionally, the tenant must notify their landlord in writing that they are unable to pay rent at least seven days prior to rent being due.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No tenants are exempt from paying their rent entirely, however; the executive order only stops evictions. Tenants must pay all the rent they missed after the May 31 deadline or they will then face eviction, according to the statewide order.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County eviction moratorium shares the May 31 deadline and also stipulates that the ordinance only protects against eviction and does not excuse any tenants from paying rent back at a later time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People who can pay rent should pay rent, but we cannot allow people to get evicted at a time </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when it will spread the sickness and endanger us all,” 1st District Supervisor Das Williams said in a press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Williams, who authored the ordinance alongside 2nd District Supervisor Gregg Hart, said during the meeting that the ordinance is a necessary step to prevent the rise of houselessness and the spread of coronavirus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If there were a large number of evictions, we would either have more people congregating as homeless, or more people congregating in the homes of friends and family,” Williams said. “That is not a good thing for limiting the spread of coronavirus.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ordinance has legal limitations as to who is and who is not protected by the moratorium, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">County Counsel Michael C. Ghizzoni, who spoke at the supervisors meeting about the legal implication of the ordinance, said</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, tenants must notify their landlords that they have been economically impacted specifically by the coronavirus pandemic, not for any other reasons. Additionally, the ordinance does “not prohibit</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against the landlord pursuing a payment of rent through any of the other causes of action that they have,” Ghizzoni said, meaning that the supervisors are only restricting landlords from evicting tenants, not from other warning actions against tenants not paying rent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many community members showed support for the moratorium over the phone and through email, but some worried about the burden of tenants having to pay back missed rent after the protections expire in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Richard Appelbaum, a UCSB professor emeritus in the global studies department, voiced his concern in an email to the Board of Supervisors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realize that landlords need to be made whole once this passes; but tenants who were unemployed will have lost the income that would otherwise be used for the missed rental payments,” Appelbaum wrote. “Somehow, they should be protected.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Board of Supervisors does not have the authority to provide financial support to people who have lost jobs, 5th District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino said. Residents should instead count on the national government for unemployment help, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that’s a little over our pay-grade at the county level, but keep your eyes on that federal stimulus package,” Lavagnino said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ordinance only protects unincorporated areas of the county, but individual cities within Santa Barbara County have already taken action to prevent evictions during the pandemic, including Goleta, Santa Barbara and Ojai. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because I.V. is unincorporated territory in Santa Barbara County, any protections for I.V. residents must come from the countywide level.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

If approved, this action would be statewide, and could affect every department at the University of California,” UAW 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar said in a press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the COLA movement grows across the UC, graduate students have emphasized that their actions are a “wildcat” strike, meaning that they are striking without the approval of their union and contract, which was negotiated by UAW in 2018 and expires in 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/janet-napolitano-ucsc-administration-warn-of-termination-to-striking-ucsc-graduate-students/\">wrote</a> on Feb. 14 to UCSC faculty that the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) would not “re-open the agreement or negotiate a separate side-letter.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 24, the UC Regents filed an <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SFCO238H.UPC-JE.pdf\">Unfair Practice Charge</a> against UAW. Since the UC system is a public institution, all labor disputes go through PERB when one party in a state labor contract alleges another of unfair practice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents allege that UAW “condoned, supported, encouraged, and failed to take affirmative action to end, unlawful concerted activity in violation of the parties’ No Strikes clause,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Unfair Practice Charge will be decided by PERB in a public hearing if the charges are not settled beforehand. A hearing date has not been set, according to UAW statewide Trustee and doctoral history student Andrew Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents are requesting that PERB issue multiple orders of action against UAW: one declaring the work stoppages at UCSC and all other UC campuses an illegal strike, and another order for UAW to refrain from engaging in any strikes, according to the charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Regents are also requesting that PERB seek an injunction to prevent Academic Student Employees (ASE) — which includes teaching assistants, tutors and readers — and UAW from engaging in strikes and “any other relief the Board deems just and proper,” the charges read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the two orders both restrict current strikes, if enacted, the injunction would give the UC the authority to forcibly shut down strikes with police at all UC campuses, according to Elrod. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the UC Regents’ unfair practice charge, UAW filed two separate Unfair Practice Charges on Feb. 28 and March 2 against the Regents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2865_ULP.pdf\">first set</a> of charges allege that the UC refused to negotiate a COLA with UAW, while at the same time bargaining directly with individuals and university-funded student organizations, which don’t have the legal authority to bargain with the UC, according to a UAW press release.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s clear that UC wants to create an appearance that it is respecting graduate student employees while avoiding true bargaining, where the law requires the parties to stand with equal footing and to act in good faith,” the press release read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no current bargaining between graduate students and UCOP, Napolitano published a statement on Feb. 21 saying that she would meet with the UC Graduate and Professional Council (UCGPC) to discuss a variety of issues including “cost of living.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC then published a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/ucgpc-says-it-will-not-meet-with-napolitano-to-discuss-a-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">statement</a> clarifying that the meeting was not in response to COLA, and that the timing and wording of Napolitano’s statement caused a misunderstanding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charges also referenced the offer UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive extended to striking graduate students, which included guaranteed five-year packages for Ph.D. students and two-year packages for M.A. students, along with a $2,500 annual housing supplement for graduate students who submitted fall quarter grades and stopped striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Unfair-Practice-Charge-03-02-20-final.pdf\">second set</a> of Unfair Practice Charges, filed on March 2, allege that the UC violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act by <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-28/breaking-ucsc-dismisses-54-graduate-students-on-cola-strike-for-failure-to-turn-in-fall-quarter-2019-grades/\">dismissing</a> UCSC TAs from spring quarter appointments for withholding Fall Quarter 2019 grades; according to the charges, the UC “denies these workers their statutory right to union representation and is intended to bypass the union.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These charges led to the UAW Bargaining Team’s vote on March 3, paving the way for a full UAW vote of whether or not to hold a labor practice strike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have been calling for the University to come to the table and negotiate a Cost of Living Adjustment for months now. And it is not true that UC can’t reopen the contract that was ratified in 2018. It’s that they won’t. We ask them every day to open the contract and negotiate a</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COLA4ALL?src=hashtag_click\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> #COLA4ALL</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

While on strike, UCSB graduate students who work as teaching assistants will withhold Winter 2020 grades and will not hold any sections or do any work unrelated to their own degrees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large number of graduate students, undergraduates and faculty returned for the second day of the strike, with upwards of 300 showing up for day two of the rally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s graduate students are from the second campus within the UC system to go on strike in the fight for a COLA; UC Santa Cruz graduate students are on their 13th day on the picket line, and UC Davis recently announced that they will be withholding grades starting yesterday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every UC campus — except for UC San Francisco — has taken some form of organizing action for a COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike at UCSB began at 8 a.m. and continued until 5 p.m., with a rally at noon where close to 1,600 people filled the Storke Tower lawn. The crowd heard from various organizers, faculty and undergraduates before marching across bike lanes, through the Arbor and to the Mosher Alumni House parking lot. On the way back to Storke Tower, a crowd formed a circle around the University Library, continuing to chant while other speakers spoke.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diane Fujino, a professor and interim chair in the department of Asian American studies, said to the crowd at the rally that the university needs to be more seriously addressing COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When the Thomas Fires hit, this university took extraordinary measures — finals were moved to another quarter. This, I say, is an extraordinary moment. Graduate students on average spend over 50% of their income on rent. This is untenable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate Student Association (GSA) President Cierra Sorin said that the high turnout for the first day of the strike was unexpected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not gonna lie, I was scared getting up this morning. I didn’t sleep a whole lot last night; this is a big thing that we’re doing. But people came through,” Sorin said. “Every constituency on campus, I think, came through today, especially the undergrads — there were hundreds of undergrads that came out. I’m in awe.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday morning began with approximately 20 people, but by 11 a.m., that number grew to over 100, which grew to over 1,000 by noon. A large part of that crowd included undergraduates and faculty who stood in solidarity with graduate students throughout the day; more than 50 S.T.E.M. students also had their own separate march from the Chemistry Lawn before merging into the larger rally at Storke Tower. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, about 80 faculty members across different departments — all wearing black and several wearing graduation regalia — met at Cheadle Hall and delivered their own demands to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall, emphasizing that they believe there should be no retaliation against students or faculty for participating in COLA organizing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History professor Ann Marie Plane, who was one of the professors that delivered the demands, said in an interview that it was a “cordial meeting” but noted that administration and graduate students may have a hard time coming to an agreement over a COLA without “significant intervention, either by the university administration in Oakland, and/or the state legislature coming up with more funds.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t recruit top quality graduate students without some kind of augmentation. Absolutely we’re going to lose students, lose the international quality and character of the institution,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the meeting, Marshall said “it would be most appropriate to take this struggle to Sacramento,” referring to the California legislature, since he estimates it would be around $40 to $50 million to meet UCSB’s COLA estimates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marshall added that because the strike is happening without the authorization of the graduate student union, United Auto Workers Union 2865, it is the “official line of the Office of the President” that it is “illegal for the university to negotiate with the students.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local political leaders also stood in solidarity with graduate students during the strike, including Santa Barbara County 3rd District Supervisor Joan Hartmann, who is running for re-election, and I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud, who is running for State Assembly. Karen Jones, who is running against Hartmann for the supervisor seat, also came later in the day in support of COLA and to speak with COLA organizers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carlos Cruz, a second-year history doctoral student at UCSC who has continued to withhold his classes’ fall quarter grades, came down to Santa Barbara to speak at the strike, emphasizing the importance of UC-wide action in order to get a UC-wide response from UC President Janet Napolitano. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much what it comes down to is, what does solidarity mean? What does solidarity look like? If we’re going to change anything, we have to engage in solidarity,” Cruz said. “Not through the power of institutions, [but through] the power of ourselves.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the strike continues into next week, Sorin said COLA organizers plan to have more activities during the day, such as teach-ins and lectures about the history of activism and legal observation training as well as social activities, including board games and dance parties. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin said that the UCSB COLA movement is looking to capitalize on the large crowds that showed up for Thursday’s rally and turn that into a deeper involvement with the movement as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re having more folks come to us hour by hour being like, ‘What can we do to help, how can I get involved?’ We’re getting people self-assigned to sub-committees, having people continue to show up to meetings,” Sorin said.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson Guilfoil and Holly Rusch contributed reporting. </span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
