UCSC Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer gave UCSC strikers a deadline of Friday at midnight to turn in grades and end their strike, but the graduate students voted at a meeting late Friday night to continue striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer sent an email Monday morning to UCSC faculty “to clarify that fall-grade submission … will be verified on Thursday, Feb. 27,” a change from the previous Feb. 21 deadline set by Kletzer to submit grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC GSA wrote in an email to graduate students that they </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider [themselves] terminated from [their] employment” and that as of Monday morning, 351 graduate workers have committed to withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades and several departments have committed to refusing Spring Quarter 2020 appointments if striking graduate students have their spring appointments revoked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Friday occupation of Cheadle Hall was organized in solidarity with the “doomsday strike” at UCSC, the name being coined due to the termination warnings and midnight deadline from administrators. Across the UC system, graduate students on almost </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/skamidi/status/1230910763281211392\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every campus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> held a demonstration, rally or other action in support of the UCSC strikers on Friday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC strike </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— and the imminent UCSB strike — is a wildcat strike, meaning that graduate students are acting separate from United Auto Workers Union 2865 (UAW 2865), the union that represents graduate students UC-wide. The current UAW 2865 contract extends until 2022, and a clause in the </span><a href=\"https://uaw2865.org/know-your-rights/contract/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contract states</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “there shall be no strikes, stoppages or interruptions of work” while the contract is still active.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW 2865 </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQnj7hw2866SMHQiNM_NH1TWZQPm-cfG4CzlyohAl6s/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formally asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the UC to meet them at the bargaining table to negotiate a COLA for its members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Cost of living concerns have consistently been a high priority for academic student employees, and we have bargained over these matters in every set of contract negotiations at the systemwide table since 2000,” UAW 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar wrote to Peter Chester, executive director of labor relations within UCOP. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We believe both the Union and the University have an interest in ameliorating the economic hardships faced by its academic student employees who face some of the most high-rent cities in the city and country, and welcome sitting down to negotiate over these matters.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB graduate students have been organizing for a COLA since December, but most of the movement’s initial actions were in solidarity with the striking UCSC graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actions at UCSB began with a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-12-14/in-photos-ucsb-rallies-in-solidarity-with-ucsc-graduate-students/\">solidarity rally</a> in December and with a </span><a style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/ucsb-grad-students-hold-demonstration-in-solidarity-with-uc-santa-cruz-over-cost-of-living-adjustment/\">“sick-out”</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January, when approximately 150 graduate students, faculty and undergraduates marched from Storke Tower to the Arbor to coincide with the UC Regents meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizers officially </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delivered</span></a> <a href=\"https://ucsb4cola.org/demands/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a COLA on Feb. 10 to Chancellor Henry T.

There’s definitely some unfair practices happening around the fact that the UC Regents refuse to discuss it; it’s pretty disappointing,” said Kate Ripley, a first-year psychological and brain sciences major who was there to attend her Feminist Studies 30 section.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In college, I’ve noticed in all of my classes that I don’t get nearly as much instruction from professors as I do from the TAs. The TAs are there to talk to you personally. The TAs are always there for you,” said Jamie Donofrio, a second-year computer science major. “They need to live, and that’s kind of a thing where if a person needs to live, we need to be there to support them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Ripley’s perspective, the themes of Feminist Studies 30, which including unfair labor practices and exploitation, are relatable to COLA movements across the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just find it very disappointing that in this situation, the graduate students have been kind of villainized and made to seem that they’re asking for too much or asking for more than others, when they’re just asking for enough to survive,” Ripley said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially with the police force that was used at Santa Cruz, it is just really disappointing. As someone who is paying tuition, I know my tuition is going towards police brutality, and that is really frustrating.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both at the noon rally and throughout the day at Cheadle Hall, COLA organizers emphasized the importance of undergraduate support, encouraging them to attend COLA meetings and bring their friends.

I think UC bureaucracy is trying to keep this limited to a single campus because then they think they can quell the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that, from her perspective, the representatives of UCGPC are “anti-COLA” and don’t represent the feelings of UC graduate students as a whole. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I guess my question at the end of the day would be why would she talk to COLA if she doesn’t want to legitimize the movement,” Sorin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSC’s GSA sent an email to Napolitano, the UCSC administration and UCSC graduate students in response to Napolitano’s statement, noting that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCGPC has nothing to do with the COLA campaign [and] has refused contact since its inception.” They added that there is no UCSC representation on that council. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kavitha Iyengar, the president of UAW Local 2865, issued a statement earlier this morning echoing Sorin’s concerns about Napolitano’s invitation to UCGPC, saying the council did not “have legal authority to bargain on the workers’ behalf.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Conflating COLA negotiations with UCGPC’s other advocacy efforts is an attempt to buy time and deflate the energy of this movement — and it will not work,” Iyengar wrote, adding that UAW Local 2865 had </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQnj7hw2866SMHQiNM_NH1TWZQPm-cfG4CzlyohAl6s/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">formally asked</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the UC to bargain with the union for a COLA in Janaury. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB 4 COLA plans to hold a General Assembly meeting on Monday at 6 p.m. in the MultiCultural Center, where they intend to discuss their actions moving forward and prepare for the Tuesday meeting with administrators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think in part some of that is going to be determined by what is happening at Santa Cruz come Monday morning,” Sorin said. “If folks are receiving termination letters, that may escalate things here faster, it may not.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a collective movement and we are really doing our best to ensure that we are not making decisions without as many voices as possible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Sorin said she was “floored” by the response on Friday, particularly from undergraduates and faculty, and hopes to continue building a UCSB coalition moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have been here for five years.

I.V. composes nearly a third of the population within the 3rd District. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 3rd District supervisor is typically a tie-breaking position on the board, with two left-leaning zones to the south and two conservative ones to the north. Hartmann is running as a nonpartisan candidate; Jones is running as a Republican. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race’s third candidate, Bruce Porter, who also ran against Hartmann in 2016, did not attend the town hall. His campaign released a statement Tuesday afternoon requesting the town hall be rescheduled due to a “lack of communication among the organizers,” which includes Associated Students Office of the External Vice President of Local Affairs (A.S. EVPLA), Movement for Intersectional Collective Action (MICA), the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Community Center, Gauchos Vote and the Beloved Community Isla Vista</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christian Ornelas, the EVPLA, and Diana Garcia, an organizer with MICA, responded to Porter through a statement sent out later that afternoon, saying that while they would not be rescheduling the event, they were “very open to hosting another town hall event” that includes Porter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porter also later said in a press release that he plans on hosting a separate town hall in I.V. next week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Porter was not present at Tuesday’s town hall, his absence loomed over the event, as both Hartmann and Jones commented on his lack of presence.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Tonight, Bruce Porter was going to tell you that he cares about you,” Hartmann told the crowd at the end of her opening statement. “But he didn’t show up.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He bragged to his supporters about the 1,400 fewer students registered in I.V. [in 2016]. He only got 20% of the vote in I.V.; I got 80%,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Hartmann and Jones disagreed across the board on a variety of topics, at the heart of their differences are their career paths. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the incumbent, Hartmann emphasized her ongoing political experience with the Board of Supervisors and the projects she has spearheaded over the past four years since her election in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones, on the other hand, positioned herself as a political outsider, emphasizing the deregulation of private businesses as one of her main platform points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Joan and I have very different approaches to things, and the people who trust me are my friends and neighbors,” Jones said, repeatedly bringing up her working-class experience and lack of a college education throughout the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Joan has spent a lifetime working in government and she’s met some really educated, neat people like herself, but they really are not the experts on innovation or the private sector.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates also addressed issues relating to climate change and renewable energy;  Hartmann extensively spoke about her pro-environmental record and her goal to transition Santa Barbara to clean, renewable energy sources.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sustainable, renewable, predictably priced energy will be very important [for the economy],” she said, adding that clean energy would work as an appeal to bring larger companies to the northern county, both creating additional jobs and helping the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann also discussed current composting groups and efforts to ban single-use plastics on campus and in I.V. as an initiative the county could also adopt to become environmentally friendly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones did not shy away from her pro-fossil fuel stance and her own family’s connection to the oil industry in the northern county, which she views as a job creator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Hartmann] talks about S.T.E.M. jobs, this is it. I mean fossil fuel production, those involve S.T.E.M. jobs, that’s not just a bunch of meatheads doing that. These are very sophisticated jobs,” Jones said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fossil fuels are solar energy; that is stored solar energy, folks. That is through photosynthesis. The breakdown of plants become oil and we harvest it now for energy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the issue of affordable housing, both candidates agreed there is a need for additional workforce housing, particularly in I.V., but differed on what the solution would look like. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones proposed cutting down taxes and reducing government regulations to make room for smaller developers to build more housing in the county. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can’t always keep fitting more rats in the aquarium,” Jones said, referring to the spike in UCSB’s student population over the years without a comparable increase in housing options. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones suggested that prospective university students should consider initially forgoing higher education in order to decrease local housing prices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann noted that the price of rent in Santa Barbara has increased three times faster than the cost of living and said she was “working hard to force the university to follow through on their required mandate” from the state to build more housing for faculty and students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates also addressed the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost-of-living</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> adjustment (COLA) movements by graduate students at UCSB and in the larger UC system, which Hartmann said she supports. Jones said that she hopes the graduate students can work out a deal with the university but added that she dislikes using union tactics to do so. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two candidates also provided drastically different opinions on the topic of equity and diversity in I.V. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also believe that our institutions must do everything they can to promote diversity and inclusion,” Hartmann said. “When I was a graduate student, I was the only woman in my class and there were no women professors at my graduate school.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones responded, saying, “I don’t see color, I don’t see sexual orientation, I don’t even see sex,” and believes that no group should gain “special” rights. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she is “the only local person that is native-born, married to a guy who was born in the 3rd District.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another topic affecting both I.V. and the county as a whole is the legalization and regulation of recreational cannabis. Hartmann said she has worked to change county-wide legislation from a lottery to merit-based system when issuing cannabis dispensary licenses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People [have] said to me, ‘Hell no, we don’t want [a lottery system]. You go back and change the county’s mind because we want a merit-based system.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann said that she’ll be back in I.V. in the spring to hold a community meeting for residents to discuss what they want in an ideal cannabis dispensary applicant, and from there, will use that input to assess which applicant will fit the goals and needs of I.V. residents, a process that will “differ by community” across the county.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones said she favors private businesses and deregulation in the cannabis industry and said she believes regulations get in the way of small businesses, like cannabis dispensaries, from operating. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hartmann argued that county regulation of the cannabis industry was necessary, saying that without regulation, cannabis “can be quite contaminated and create a lot of problems for people in our county.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones acknowledged in her closing statement that, as a Republican, she is unlikely to win many votes in I.V., but encouraged the crowd — some of whom occasionally heckled her during the event — to vote and advance her instead of Porter to the November ballot against Hartmann.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the previous race for the seat in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-08/joan-hartmann-wins-third-district-county-supervisor/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hartmann won 53.96% of the district votes, beating out Porter’s 45.79%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You can get your friends and classmates to vote for me and it will not jeopardize Joan’s chances at all,” Jones said. “It will give her somebody that is a worthy opponent.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her closing statement, Hartmann reiterated her positions stated during the town hall along with some of the endorsements she received, including one from the recently withdrawn candidate, Jessica Alvarez Parfrey.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I will continue to lead the just transition to a green energy economy with environmental and economic benefits, I will support a more representative and inclusive county government, I will fight for progressive causes including workers’ rights and environmental justice and I will protect your safety, our water resources, our open spaces and our climate,” Hartmann said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. Max Abrams/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her discussion, titled “From Social Movement to Social Impact: Putting an End to Sexual Harassment,” challenged the audience to expand their personal definitions of gender-based violence and emphasized the structural change required to transform the culture around sexual harassment and violence across the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Santa Barbara’s Feminist Futures Initiative, which brings together UC Santa Barbara faculty, students and outside speakers to collaborate on interdisciplinary research on gender justice, hosted the event alongside the UCSB Women’s Center and local businesswoman Sara Miller McCune. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in the afternoon, Hill met with over 30 high school students, undergraduates and graduate students, some of whom are engaged with researching sexual harassment on campus, according to Professor Leila Rupp, associate dean of social sciences, who introduced Hill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“None of the students this afternoon were even born when Dr. Hill gave her courageous and world-altering testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,” Rupp said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also spoke at UCSB in 1995, and at the beginning of her speech noted that, after 25 years, it is “hard to imagine we are still in the struggle together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realize that it’s been a while since 1991. Some of you are probably wondering, ‘Why didn’t you wear that green suit?’ and some of you are probably wondering, ‘Oh, when’s she gonna start dishing the dirt on the senators?’” she joked to the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill did not dwell on her own experiences in the Senate Judiciary Committee and instead focused her speech on the work that still remains after the launch of the #MeToo movement, which reignited the conversation about accountability of those in powerful positions regarding sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill noted that her own experiences in the Senate parallel that of Christine Blasey Ford, who in 2017 testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was in high school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to understand that what happened to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford should never happen again, but we also have to recognize that it is happening every day to somebody in this country,” Hill told the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that outrage over the Kavanaugh confirmation changed the course of the 2018 midterm election, but that the response from the federal government since then has been lacking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No robust government response to gender-based violence has occurred and in this primary cycle, little or no attention has been given to what many call a moment of reckoning that happened back in 2017,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of conversation around sexual violence, Hill said, includes current 2020 Democratic primary candidates, who participated in a debate in Nevada on the night of Hill’s speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are in another debate tonight and if the history proves to be a reflection of what’s going to happen in the future, those questions are not going to be had,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill challenged the audience to expand the way they view gender justice to include not only sexual harassment, but sexual assault, domestic violence, rape and incest. To fully understand the problem of gender-based violence, Hill said that society needs to examine the “bigger picture” of how survivors are treated beyond the specifics of their own experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can relate to the individual stories, but it is just as important for us to see what is happening on a larger scale, on the social scale, if we are going to address it,” Hill said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our solutions have to be multi-dimensional because the impacts of gender-based violence are multi-dimensional. It impacts [people’s] ability in many cases, depending on the nature of the problem, to have housing, to be educated, to live safely in their communities.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill said that the U.S. government has “taken on huge social problems,” such as the opioid crisis, by addressing the problem as a matter of public safety, and that the same approach needs to be taken to address gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Hill said that this can’t be left to the government to solve alone, that individuals need to also view gender-based violence as a matter of public safety and “problem solve as a community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Do we really believe that abuse that affects one person affects us all? Do we really believe that we are all in this? I’m not sure we do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One structural change Hill proposed to address gender-based violence is to challenge how society as a whole approaches masculinity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This idea of manliness is curated to make us believe that to be a man you must be emotionally restrained, strong and brave, aggressive and awesome,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[That] is not masculinity, it is abuse.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill also elaborated on what she said is the systematic practice of silencing people who choose to come forward with stories of gender-based violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Believing women to be truthful is consistent with fairness and justice,” she said. “Now all of you believe that, right?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After cheers and applause from the audience, she continued, “We are now in a time where if we say we believe survivors, we are met with the claim that we are denying due process. In other words, due process has been weaponized to silence survivors.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do not support a system that presumes every time a woman testifies about abuse, she is lying. But that is what many of us start with: that she cannot be trusted to tell the truth,” Hill emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill’s testimony against Thomas in 1991 raised complicated questions about the intersectionality of race and gender, she said. Opponents criticized Hill for coming forward, saying she “did a disservice to the Black community by testifying.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those critics, Hill asked for the trust that she believes all survivors deserve. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Q&amp;A portion of the event, Hill spoke with UCSB feminist studies graduate students Amoni Thompson and Megan Spencer, answering their questions about her career and life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responding to a question from Spencer about solidarity with student movements, Hill expressed her support for UC graduate students calling for a cost-of-living adjustment, a movement known as COLA. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Affordable housing is an issue for everyone,” Hill said to audience applause. “Unfortunately, most families have to fight that issue on their own, but our students should not have to fight this battle on their own. Universities should be using their resources to help them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hill left the audience with a challenge: No matter how difficult it may be to fully change the culture around gender-based violence, she said, it is just as important now as it was when she first spoke to the Senate in 1991 to fight for structural change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is natural to revert back to the status quo. It’s inevitable. But the problem is so severe, we cannot afford to do that.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Feb. 20, 2020 print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Organizers are planning to take a vote next Monday to potentially go on strike at UCSB, if UCSC graduate students are dismissed from teaching positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an informal poll about the possibility of striking at UCSB with 595 responses, 63% of graduate students who responded said they were “willing to pursue” a full strike if UCSC dismisses graduate student strikers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorin noted during the meeting that these numbers are greater than ones from initial strike polls at UCSC prior to the beginning of their strike, and that more than a quarter of the entire graduate student population had responded to the poll. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COLA organizers said in the meeting that they plan to send out another poll next week to graduate students to assess support of a grading strike or full teaching strike and will meet again on Monday evening for COLA General Assembly.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

have been on a full wildcat strike since last Monday Feb. 10, but have been demanding a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/ucsb-graduate-students-present-demands-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the form of a monthly stipend to alleviate high costs of housing since Fall Quarter 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike is known as a wildcat strike because it is not approved by United Auto Workers (UAW) 2865, the graduate students’ union.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the university did not meet the demands for a COLA of $1,412, hundreds of graduate students at UCSC voted in December to withhold over 12,000 undergraduate grades until the demands were met. When the graduate students went on a full strike last Monday, they refused to hold sections, grade or hold office hours in addition to continuing to withhold fall quarter grades. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an open letter addressed to all faculty, staff and students, Napolitano said the contract between the university and UAW 2865 contains a “contractual promise” that its teaching assistants (TAs) would not strike while the contract was in effect, through June 30, 2022.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that the current contract allows for waived tuition, 3% annual wage increases, childcare subsidies, a one-time signing bonus and a remission of healthcare premiums. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The obligations between the University and its unions are negotiated and memorialized systemwide in collective bargaining agreements, which must be voted on and ratified by the union membership,” Napolitano wrote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling the wildcat strike “in direct violation of the existing collective bargaining agreement,” Napolitano said the UC would not re-open the union’s current contract nor would it agree to a COLA in addition to the current contract.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The TAs must honor their side of the bargain, just as the University must honor its commitments. The wildcat strike must come to an end,” Napolitano ended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer sent a separate email on the same day to all UCSC faculty, informing them that graduate students who did not submit grades from Fall Quarter 2019 would be dismissed from TA positions for Spring Quarter 2020. Kletzer wrote that graduate students had until Feb. 21 to “submit all missing grades, to end the strike and to fulfill their contractual obligations,” before facing consequences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Those who do not submit full grade information by February 21 will not receive spring quarter appointments or will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments,” Kletzer wrote, calling it a “difficult next step that our campus must take.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her email, Kletzer also emphasized multiple times the “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">costs on students, particularly our undergraduate students,” that the strike was creating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She urged faculty members to “speak with [their] TAs and advisees and encourage them to stop their unsanctioned strike and to submit the missing grades.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kletzer noted that UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive had proposed two new initiatives in an effort to end the strike: creating support packages for up to five years for doctoral students and two years for master’s students, alongside a $2,500 annual need-based housing stipend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous interview with the Nexus, Jane Komori, a doctoral student within the history of consciousness department and co-secretary of the UCSC Graduate Student Association (GSA), called the offers “insufficient,” and said they showed, to her, that the university “doesn’t take our demands seriously at all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Feb. 15, UCSC’s GSA addressed Napolitano and Ketzler’s letters in an email to graduate students, telling the students not to submit their fall quarter grades before the GSA General Assembly meeting on Feb. 18, where they plan to discuss the termination threats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a decisive moment in our struggle,” the UCSC GSA wrote in the email, noting that this was the first communication the graduate students have received from Napolitano regarding the strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the email, over 200 graduate students had received warning letters from the university for failing to submit Fall Quarter 2019 grades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If hundreds of graduate student workers are terminated from employment, whole departments will be unable to offer courses next quarter, dozens of international graduate students will effectively face deportation, UCSC rankings will nosedive, huge sources of funding will be jeopardized, political organizing at other campuses will intensify, and UCSC may become subject to academic boycott (over 1,000 non-UCSC scholars and educators have already committed to a pledge of </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG2HqiSsC2XFFaT26e0YfGkRNo0LbIxQAiCxHoG12IlErlSw/viewform\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">solidarity and non-cooperation with UCSC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">),” the email read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In short, such a move would profoundly impoverish graduate and undergraduate education and research at UCSC, as well as its collaborations and partnerships with other research institutions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email also noted that a poll taken in mid-January found that 715 graduate students were in favor of withholding Winter Quarter 2020 grades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our readiness to escalate is profoundly unsettling for UC leadership,” the email continued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Union leadership at UCSB addressed Napolitano’s letter on Feb. 18 in an email to the UC Office of the President (UCOP), UCSC leadership and the COLA email groups at UCSC and UCSB. Sheila Kulkarni, the recording secretary of the UAW 2865 bargaining unit at UCSB, said in the email that termination of existing employment for spring quarter is a violation of </span><a href=\"http://uaw2865.org/know-your-rights/contract/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Article 3 (Appointment Security), Section D</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the agreement, an Academic Student Employee (ASE) can only be removed from a position when the student has become “academically ineligible.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The University has no standing to terminate ASEs who have been promised employment in spring quarter,” Kulkarni wrote in the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To be clear, if you are a TA who has been promised an appointment for spring quarter in any way, formally or informally, verbally or in writing, this statement from President Napolitano is in clear violation of your union rights… We are more than happy to help file grievances on behalf of our colleagues at UC Santa Cruz.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSC COLA movement is calling on graduate students at other schools to begin striking as well, UCSB graduate students discussed in their most recent COLA meeting on Thursday.

Graduate students have been organizing the demands since Jan. 21, when students held a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/graduate-students-to-call-in-sick-on-wednesday-in-support-of-ucsc-strike-for-cost-of-living-adjustment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“sick-out”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in support of UCSC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emily, a first-year sociology graduate student who declined to give her last name, spoke to the crowd at the University Library on Monday about how the list of demands was created, noting that it was important that as many graduate student voices as possible were included. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We read all the comments on the 994 surveys we got, we took it into consideration, we wrote these and this is what we came up with,” Emily told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All campuses across UC are organizing in some way for this COLA, and that’s how we’re going to get strength and prove to the administration that something’s got to change if we stand together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lex Taylor, a third-year political science and economics major, also spoke to the crowd in front of the library, representing a handful of undergraduate students who marched in solidarity with graduate students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are mostly taught by grad students. These are the people making sure this university is working … that we are going into our classes getting the education we deserve,” Taylor said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taylor also referenced the three-year long </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/three-years-later-afscme-service-workers-reach-tentative-contract-agreement-with-uc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strike efforts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union as a sign that COLA efforts can be successful too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME, for the last three years, striked on and off, and they won. Right now at Santa Cruz, grad students are starting to strike, we are about to give our demands all across the UCs and grad students are showing what they can do,” Taylor added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Emily read the demands aloud and several graduate students spoke regarding the need for COLA, the group marched from the University Library to the fifth floor of Cheadle Hall, where students presented the list of demands to Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond asking for a COLA, the students’ demands included several stipulations: that the COLA amount will be recalculated annually to account for increases in housing costs, that a COLA will not come from an increase in graduate or undergraduate tuition, that the university will not retaliate in any form against those supporting or participating in the demand for a COLA and that the university will accommodate the higher financial needs of graduate students with children or dependent adults.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demand letter also highlighted the COLA’s necessity and explained that the amount comes from calculating average graduate student income and housing costs in the local area, to determine what amount is necessary per month to keep graduate students from rent burden.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter explained that the baseline for a rent burden is 31%, meaning that 31% or more of an individual’s income goes towards housing. However, the average rent burden for graduate students at UCSB is 51%, as calculated by UAW 2865.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stipend necessary to alleviate rent burden at UCSB is the fourth-highest stipend estimate in the UC system, behind Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Los Angeles, according to the UAW report. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate students earn their income from a variety of different funding sources, such as fellowships, grants, teaching assistant positions and research. Because sources of income vary from student to student and may change on a quarterly basis, UCSB graduate students emphasized in the demands letter that they are asking for a cost-of-living adjustment that is dispersed each month through the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All UCSB graduate students, “regardless of their graduate program, department, year in program, residence, visa category, documentation, funding source, and employment status,” will receive the same COLA amount, according to demands.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an email statement, UC Office of the President Associate Director for Media Relations Andrew Gordon stated that the strike at UCSC is “illegal,” adding that it “does not further the discussion on how to increase housing affordability for student employees.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon explained that the university reached a four-year contract with UAW in August 2018 and that the contract is in place through June 2020. He said that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while the University does not plan to reopen the signed and ratified contract with UAW, we did recently hold a meeting to discuss legitimate student concerns regarding housing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC appreciates the information provided by the UAW and the ongoing dialogue regarding affordable housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that the demands have been released to the university, UCSB graduate students will move forward with increasing awareness around the push for a COLA and negotiating with the university, with no plans in the works for a strike, according to multiple graduate students at previous COLA meetings.</span></p>\n<p>Additional photos and coverage of the strike can be viewed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1226971585468358657\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2020-02-11/in-photos-ucsb-graduate-students-present-cola-demands-amidst-uc-wide-rallies/\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

legitimate chapter of the national Rock the Vote organization. <em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no public questioning of the group’s practices until</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SBStudentActivistNetwork/posts/rock-the-vote-sb-has-been-caughtrock-the-vote-sb-has-been-masquerading-for-month/1810602312406454/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a Facebook post </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published on Jan. 11 by the Student Activist Network alleged that Rock the Vote SB was not a legitimate chapter of the national Rock the Vote organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Rock the Vote SB stole the logo of a nonprofit that has national recognition for being a nonpartisan, get-out-the-vote effort. They then set up a nonprofit and used that branding of that trusted nonprofit, basically as a way to say that their organization is objective and is to be trusted,” said Ry Brennan, a member of the Student Activist Network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> representative from the national Rock the Vote organization confirmed that Rock the Vote SB was formed in August 2019 as a part of the larger organization, but as of now is “not a legitimate chapter.” They also said that the national organization sent Rock the Vote SB a cease-and-desist letter in December.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Rock the Vote SB Executive Director Robin Howe explained in a statement that Rock the Vote SB was a compliant chapter with the national organization beginning in August 2019. In November, he was told that Rock the Vote DC “received complaints” regarding the Rock the Vote SB operation. Rock the Vote SB initially “wholeheartedly attempted to work with them to bring our operation into compliance,” he said, but was asked by the national organization in December to “drop our affiliation.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock the Vote SB then “immediately ceased operation[s],” Howe said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe added that the Student Activist Network’s allegations –– which included that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote in I.V. by encouraging online voter registration, telling people their car insurance would go up if they voted in Isla Vista and that the group encouraged people to vote at home instead of in I.V. ––  were “misleading and unverified.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allegations of voter suppression not only relate to Rock the Vote but also alleged ties to Bruce Porter, a candidate running for the third district seat in the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors March election. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said that in August 2019, he responded to a post on the Rock the Vote SB website that stated the group was hiring. He then was “introduced to and met briefly with Bruce Porter,” who “mentioned his intention was to create a non-partisan voter registration group in Isla Vista.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a letter Porter sent to his supporters on Jan. 15, which was obtained by the Nexus, Porter discussed Rock the Vote’s alleged intent to cause low voter turnout. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Congressman Salud] Carbajal and [Supervisor Joann] Hartmann went all out to crush the nonpartisan voter registration effort in Isla Vista and shotgun accusations of voter suppression,” Porter wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, Rock the Vote has done a fabulous job of providing truthful and objective voter registration education to students. The result: far more students chose to register back home and there are 1400 fewer students registered to vote in IV this year, compared to this point in 2016, even though the student population has significantly increased.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe told his staff in an email sent on Jan. 15 that operations were “on hold for the moment” due to “local political issues.” Howe told them in the email to refrain from wearing their T-shirts and doing any branding and to delete all social media accounts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers were left without a clear reason why all operations had ended out of nowhere as Howe instructed staff to tell current and potential volunteers “the schedule is full and no more volunteers are needed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple Rock the Vote SB volunteers spoke to the Nexus, saying they had no idea that the organization was illegitimate until this week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I saw a post on Free and For Sale that was basically just trashing Rock the Vote for all these allegations,” said Sean Price, a first-year pre-biology major. “At first I didn’t believe it, but then I found out that the website was gone, Facebook was gone; I haven’t checked their Instagram, but I’m sure that’s gone too. I didn’t hear anything from them when this all happened.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A second-year volunteer, who asked not to be named, said that they tried to reach out about changing their shift day for winter quarter and never heard back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I did get was an email about there’s been stuff going on this week with tabling. So I had no idea basically what was going on until I read an article on Facebook about that it could potentially be a fraudulent organization … they stopped tabling, and then just nothing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Student Activist Network raised three separate allegations against Rock the Vote SB accusing them of voter suppression in Isla Vista. The group alleges that Rock the Vote gave out voter registration cards at the Arbor instead of filling out physical forms, that they told people their car insurance costs would increase if they registered to vote in I.V. and that they encouraged people to vote at their home addresses in other parts of the state instead of in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteers who spoke to the Nexus confirmed that official registration forms were “rarely” provided for tabling in favor of voter registration cards that directed people to the Rock the Vote SB website, which has since been shut down, to register to vote on their own time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the eyes of the Student Activist Network, handing out cards makes it less likely for students to register to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have tabled many times at the Arbor and I know that students are often walking by very, very quickly. They often take things that are handed to them and then immediately throw them away,” Brennan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The best way to actually get somebody signed up to vote is to actually ask them to come over to your table and fill out the form. That is the only way that you could actually guarantee that the people who you have actually gotten to bring over to your booth are actually going to follow through … We only complicate the process when we ask people to go online to fill out forms.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Howe said in a statement that Rock the Vote SB encouraged online registration but “ALWAYS carried hardcopies of voter registration cards for those who preferred that method which we found to be rare because Gen Z generally is a digital culture.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One second-year volunteer, who requested their name not be used, said they were confused about why voter registration forms were not the norm but didn’t deeply question the practice because they believed Rock the Vote SB to be a legitimate organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel really frustrated because in retrospect looking back, things were sort of red flags,” they said. They added that they were made familiar with the organization through a UCSB honors mail listserv. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just never assumed that through an honors mail listserv that an actual, illegitimate thing could be presented to us students,” they said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another allegation raised by the Student Activist Network was that Rock the Vote SB told students that their car insurance rates would go up if they registered to vote in I.V., which they heard from multiple students who Rock the Vote SB volunteers had spoken with, but Howe rejected that claim. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I have never heard of the concept of car insurance rates getting raised nor did anything remotely close to that ever get discussed with my team,” Howe said in the statement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This claim is the most bizarre of them all. It is so obviously unbelievable it waves a red </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flag as to how low the people spreading these dishonest statements will go for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their own political gain.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No volunteers that the Nexus spoke with had ever heard of discussions about car insurance rates increasing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final issue raised by the Student Activist Network is that Rock the Vote SB suppressed the vote by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“dissuading people from registering in IV on the grounds that other elections in the Bay, LA, and San Diego are more contested,” according to its Facebook post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the backside of the Rock the Vote SB online voting card obtained by the Nexus, the card reads that “It’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Choice Where to Register,” whether that be at home or school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The card’s wording did not raise alarms for Price until this past week. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are three places on the card: Los Angeles, San Diego and Bay Area issues, but nothing in Santa Barbara, like no reason to vote in Santa Barbara, and then there’s websites to each place about those issues,” Price said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It basically just said vote where you think your opinion matters more, like where you’ll make a difference, which is basically what I told people and what I thought was being advertised by them, but now I’ve heard that it’s not.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no further information from Howe or Rock the Vote SB in general, student volunteers for Rock the Vote SB have been left confused about where the organization stands and remain frustrated by new information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everything looked very legit and no interactions that I had with anyone were bad. They were all just pretty straightforward. I was just to get my volunteer hours, so that’s really frustrating for someone who was trying to have volunteers actually make a difference and register people to vote and that’s important to me,” one volunteer said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can’t help beating myself up, like why didn’t I, like, think this was a bigger issue at the time?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Honestly, I’m waiting for more information to come to light because I feel very taken advantage of,” Price said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I figured I was doing something to help voter registration and improve community involvement. And if that’s the opposite of what was happening, then that’s the exact opposite of why I joined this.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 23 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

She worked with the Persian Student Group to quickly plan the vigil in only a few days, calling it a “multi-group effort.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar holds the loss close to her heart as she personally knew victims in the crash. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have to remember every single life that was lost. It wasn’t just the life — that life had a family, that life had a mom, a dad, a sister, professors, friends,” Abrishamcar told the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I myself, my family had a close family friend that passed away.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar wasn’t alone in mourning the loss of someone she knew personally. Farhad Kaimi, a community member at the event, said he attended the vigil to “pay respect for the people who died.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had a friend who I knew from middle school and high school. We weren’t close friends but he was on that plane,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Aazam Feiz, a lecturer in Persian language and literature, spoke entirely in Farsi at the vigil. Second-year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gevirtz doctoral student Sepi, who declined to disclose her last name, spoke immediately after Feiz, translating Feiz’s words to English for those who didn’t speak Farsi. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are here to pay respect to these victims … as many of you may have heard, a lot of these victims were students and professors, just ordinary people who were visiting family and friends in Iran and never made it back home,” Sepi translated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There were kids, newlyweds, whole families, even, who perished,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the vigil, Sepi emphasized the importance of creating an event that is accessible to everyone, regardless of language. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Last week, there was a lot of heightened tension, there was a lot of political tension and we are gathering today to honor the lives of innocent victims that were basically as a result of those tensions … I wanted to welcome our non-Iranian friends who gathered with us in solidarity of the lives of the victims who were innocent and who died last week,” Sepi said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abrishamcar echoed this message — that lives lost always need to be remembered, above any political or religious differences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially in the climate that we have in Iran right now, it’s very hard to find unity,” Abrishamcar said after the vigil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone has different beliefs and religions and political preferences, but it’s important to have this vigil to remind the people of Iran, in Iran and outside of Iran, that at the end of the day, we are all Iranians and we have to remember these 176 lives that were lost. Their death[s] should not be cluttered with the politics that’s going on right now.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the end of the vigil, Feiz recited traditional Persian poetry, a cultural custom often performed during times of mourning, according to Abrishamcar, who said there are specific ways to both sing and pronounce the verses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the group joined together in singing the Iranian national anthem, the vigil ended as it began — in the glow of the candlelight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Iran is a country of many religions and many cultures. We’re not all Persian, we’re not all Muslim.

Parasite</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bong Joon-ho’s Korean masterpiece will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Humorous moments in the film crash right up against the most heartbreaking, and the film succeeds because it does more than thrill. Bong Joon-ho weaves the message of income inequality and the danger of greed into every moment. The result is also visually stunning — I could go on analyzing each frame as if it’s a painting in a museum, but I’ll save the time and tell you that this is a must-see film.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>2. Little Women</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s been no lack of adaptations of the beloved 1868 Louisa May Alcott novel, but director Greta Gerwig creates a delightfully fresh take while still remaining loyal to the source content. The film follows the four March sisters through their adolescence and adulthood, but instead of moving in chronological order, Gerwig jumps back and forth through their lives. It’s truly an ensemble masterpiece, but look out for standout performances by Saorsie Ronan as Jo and Florence Pugh as Amy. </span></p>\n<p><strong>3.

The film is semi-autobiographical, following fictional filmmaker Salvador Mallo through the physical decline that keeps him from filmmaking — the one thing holding him together. Mallo’s decline is cut together with fragments of his past life and the role that passion — and reconciliation of that passion — play in making him whole again. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91937\" style=\"width: 346px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marriage-story.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1632460026\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"91931\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91937\" data-attachment-id=\"91937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/an-exhilarating-year-of-film-the-best-of-2019/marriage-story/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marriage-story.jpg?fit=1383%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1383,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"marriage story\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marriage-story.jpg?fit=169%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marriage-story.jpg?fit=692%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91937\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marriage-story.jpg?resize=336%2C497\" alt=\"\" width=\"336\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marriage-story.jpg?w=1383&amp;ssl=1 1383w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marriage-story.jpg?resize=169%2C250&amp;ssl=1 169w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marriage-story.jpg?resize=768%2C1137&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/marriage-story.jpg?resize=692%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 692w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of IMDb</p></div>\n<p><strong>4. Marriage Story</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noah Baumbach’s film about a couple (Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) in the middle of a cross-country divorce feels like an intimate play more than a movie. Driver and Johansson do a phenomenal job of bringing us right up close in their characters’ lives as if you were there along with them. Your allegiances to the characters may change many times over the course of the film, but instead of leaving us with a sour taste in our mouths, Baumbach gives us a glimmer of hope, or perhaps the knowledge that just because things may not be the same doesn’t mean they’re worse. </span></p>\n<p><strong>5. The Irishman</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Director Martin Scorsese doesn’t waste a single frame in this three-and-a-half-hour mob drama, helmed by Robert DeNiro and supported by Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. To follow the life of Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) as he rises and falls within the organized crime game is an intense character study that won’t fail to captivate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6. Jojo Rabbit</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All credit to writer-actor-director Taika Waititi for making us feel okay with laughing during a Nazi film. Some of the funniest and most devastating moments of cinema this year happen within minutes of each other in “Jojo Rabbit,” one of the most original and creative film concepts to come in years. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_91938\" style=\"width: 344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/once-hollywood.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"914068644\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"91931\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-91938\" data-attachment-id=\"91938\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/an-exhilarating-year-of-film-the-best-of-2019/once-hollywood/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/once-hollywood.jpg?fit=691%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"691,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"once hollywood\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/once-hollywood.jpg?fit=169%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/once-hollywood.jpg?fit=691%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-91938\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/once-hollywood.jpg?resize=334%2C495\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/once-hollywood.jpg?w=691&amp;ssl=1 691w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/once-hollywood.jpg?resize=169%2C250&amp;ssl=1 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-91938\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Sony Pictures</p></div>\n<p><strong>7. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t go in expecting the typical Quentin Tarantino style which he has defined himself by over the past 20 years. The film takes its time — over two and a half hours to be exact – following 24 hours in the lives of its two fictional men Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (scene-stealer Brad Pitt), as well Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). It’s a love letter to Hollywood and the bygone era of the 1960s and the film’s ending will have you talking long after the credits roll. </span></p>\n<p><strong>8. Ford v Ferrari</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">James Mangold’s racing film feels taken from the golden era of 1970s action cinema, resembling Steve McQueen more than anything from the 21st century. An extra nod to Mangold’s efforts to use minimal CGI for racing sequences; the technical caliber of the film is off the charts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>9. Knives Out</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rian Johnson’s whodunnit film isn’t really a whodunnit at all; the film subverses the genre to create a masterfully executed film filled with twist after twist and a great ensemble cast to keep the fun going throughout. </span></p>\n<p><strong>10. The Farewell</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lulu Wang’s film, “based on a real lie,” as it announces itself, follows Billi (the brilliant Awkwafina) as she goes back to China with her family to see her dying grandmother — who doesn’t know she’s dying.

The board includes an undergraduate and graduate representative from each UC campus, except UC San Francisco, which only has graduate students and thus only a graduate student representative. The board is tasked with meeting regularly to advise the system-wide office on Title IX policy changes and to provide student input on the office’s decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of publication, the system-wide Title IX Office and UC Office of the President Media Relations staff did not respond with information about whether the graduate position remains vacant. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an interview with the Nexus, Reynolds noted that the timing of her appointment is particularly important in light of recent sexual assault <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/sigma-pi-removes-fraternity-member-following-sexual-assault-allegations/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795293000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRkktG4x3EpTr6IfWY69YOkBQAow\">allegations</a> against fraternity members during Fall Quarter of 2019 and the subsequent campus <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/speculation-and-scrutiny-community-reacts-to-timely-warning/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795295000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHsZSIXhGlRx0Nt7lrhQJT9fY0bRA\">response</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, we’re at a very heightened time with regard to discourse around sexual assault and sexual harrassment [at UCSB] … so I think it’s really important that we use that discourse not just to bring awareness to these things and to talk about them, but also to provide tangible change that can prevent future instances,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Right now, especially because I know of a lot of personal stories of students who have or have not gone to [the] Title IX [office] because they feel that the Title IX system is very backlogged, and it can just be extremely frightening to go to Title IX as it is.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, Reynolds served as the policy analyst for Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) and currently serves as its director, bringing the experience to her role as the undergraduate representative. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the first projects I had was when the Department of Education released their proposed changes to the federal Title IX document, and my job was to read over that hundred-page legal document and condense it,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes to Federal Title IX policy were first proposed in November 2018 by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and would </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">req</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uire “presumption of innocence throughout the grievance process” and a live cross-examination of survivors among other changes, according to the U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-devos-proposed-title-ix-rule-provides-clarity-schools-support-survivors-and-due-process-rights-all&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795289000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2xXna0hJncvtIYtY4cFhcSfOIUg\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The live cross-examination during the judicial process of a Title IX investigation would mean that survivors would be in the same room as potential perpetrators, allowing cross-examination through the potential perpetrators’ lawyer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It [is] very invasive and potentially retraumatizing, I remember that was one that I specifically had a problem with,” Reynolds said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Reynolds, it was important this year more than ever that UCSB had representation on the student advisory board, because she expects the Department of Education to make a decision about whether or not to implement the proposed federal Title IX changes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Title IX Student Advisory Board was first <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1578556795289000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7uvwSiRXwKb9VOKubgI5ZjjybBw\">created</a> in November 2017 under the first system-wide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty. In January 2018, Mariah Tanaka and Jennifer Selvidge were appointed as the undergraduate and graduate representatives to the board, respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summer 2018, Tanaka resigned, leaving the undergraduate position open and Selvidge as the only UCSB representative on the board. She later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/ucsb-graduate-rep-resigns-from-title-ix-student-advisory-board/\">resigned</a> in November 2018 following a disagreement between her and system-wide Title IX leadership over comments made to Associated Students (A.S.) and the Graduate Student Association (GSA) over proposed policy changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since November 2018, UCSB has had no representation on the board. That December, GSA voted to boycott the board over the treatment of Selvidge and the lack of power in appointing its own candidate, since the system-wide office has final say over appointees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board has continued to operate over the past year without any UCSB representation. All UC representatives on the board ended their yearlong terms in the beginning of the 2019-20 academic year, so the Title IX office has had to work over Fall Quarter 2019 to not only fill long-lasting UCSB vacancies, but also new vacancies created at all of the other UC campuses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Reynolds, it is vital that all UC campuses are represented in decision-making, not only regarding Title IX but in all UC policies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are the ones that are paying for these services and the people that are paid by the UC system, we’re paying for them,” Reynolds said. “So it’s important that we know exactly what that money is being used for, and that it’s a very transparent process and it’s not under some sort of blanket or that people don’t know what’s going on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full board will meet for the first time on Jan. 17 at UCOP’s office in Oakland. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the January 9 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-91417\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ora spoke at the Nov. 13 Regents meeting, accusing Kieffer of sexual misconduct against her in 2014. <em>Courtesy of UC Regents Video.</em></p></div>\n<p>During the board meeting’s public forum, Ora, the external vice president of the UC Santa Cruz Graduate Student Association, accused Kieffer of grabbing her thigh numerous times throughout a dinner between Kieffer and various undergraduate and graduate students, held prior to the Regents’ board meeting in July 2014.</p>\n<p>“Kieffer purchased wine for the table despite the undergraduate students present. I do not drink and did not drink that night, but Kieffer did,” Ora said during public forum.</p>\n<p>“At one point in the conversation, I was shocked to feel pressure on my upper thigh and looked down incredulous to find Kieffer’s hand firmly grasping my leg. This persisted throughout the evening. I was unsettled, uncomfortable and felt powerless to stop this figure of authority from putting his hands on my body.”</p>\n<p>Kieffer, a UC Santa Barbara alumnus, has served on the Board of Regents since 2009, and his term is set to end in 2021.</p>\n<p>UC spokesperson Claire Doan said in an email that due to student privacy laws, she could not comment on specific allegations raised at the board meeting but said the University of California “takes these allegations — as we do any allegations — seriously.”</p>\n<p>Ora’s testimony also shines a light on the difference between the University of California and the UC Regents when it comes to handling sexual misconduct allegations — all decisions regarding Regent misconduct are handled by the Regents themselves, according to <a href=\"https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/1112.html\">Regents Policy 1112</a> .</p>\n<p>Ora told the Nexus that she has experienced instances of sexual misconduct before but said the power differential between herself and Kieffer limited her voice in the reporting process.</p>\n<p>“I was in a train station and somebody put his hand on my behind and squeezed, and I turned around and punched him in the stomach. That is who I am. But when you’re sitting next to somebody who’s talking about being best friends with [former California Governor] Jerry Brown, and you’re in a public space, you can’t punch him in the stomach,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>“The difference in power among people determines the type of response they’re capable of having in that moment. And I know it’s opening up a huge amount of complexity, but when a power differential was so steep that you literally cannot stand up for yourself, that makes whatever is occurring so much worse.”</p>\n<p>Ora said that she is the first person to go through the Regents misconduct investigation process, described in Regents Policy 1112, which outlines the specific policy for allegations of misconduct against a Regent.</p>\n<p>“Apparently the UC Regents have a policy all their own, written by the Regents, which states that all complaints against a Regent will be handled by the Regents … with a clear focus on ensuring the utmost delicacy toward the powerful Regent reported, rather than the individual reporting,” Ora said during public forum.</p>\n<p>“In the words of a Title IX employee, ‘In the Regents policy, I, the complainant, do not even exist.’”</p>\n<p>In response to Ora’s allegations, UC Student Association, the UC Graduate and Professional Council and the UC Council of Student Body Presidents published a joint statement on Nov. 20, supporting Ora and condemning the process for reviewing misconduct cases against the Regents.</p>\n<p>“We believe Rebecca, and we agree that the process for reviewing her case is deeply flawed. Regents Policy 1112 essentially requires Regents to hold themselves accountable by tasking a three-member panel of Regents to oversee an investigation. This is not survivor-centered, trauma-informed, impartial, or just, and it clearly prioritizes the powerful over those who may have been harmed,” the statement reads.</p>\n<p>The leaders further called on the Regents to adhere to the same Title IX policies as students, staff and faculty, calling for further accountability by state elected officials.</p>\n<p>Ora first spoke during a June 2018 Regents meeting about her general experiences navigating Title IX as a graduate student — not relating to Kieffer — and was approached by someone following her comments.</p>\n<p>Ora said she had told the person about what had reportedly happened with Kieffer in 2014, when he let her know that he was a “responsible employee,” also known as a mandated reporter, which means he is required by UC Title IX Policy to report Ora’s story as an instance of “sexual violence, sexual harassment or other conduct prohibited by the policy to the Title IX officer or designee.”</p>\n<p>Ora was given a few options by the case’s mediator: pursue a case against Kieffer, or let it go. If she pursued a case, she would have to decide whether to go directly into an investigation against Kieffer or attempt to settle through the internal alternative resolution process, where a mediator would handle the case directly with the appointed Regents.</p>\n<p>“Even though I’ve been a student leader for so many years, it took me this horrendous conversation to realize like, ‘Oh, wow, I do need to follow this through,’ because it’s not a matter of whether I’m okay or not and how many meetings I have to step out of and avoid. It’s a matter of somebody with such lax judgment is determining the consequences of all of the perpetrators in the system,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>During public forum last week, Ora said she was encouraged at the time of reporting to “informally resolve the matter so as to avoid an investigation” and said in the interview that she felt pressured then by the case’s mediator to first handle the case internally.</p>\n<p>“I was given no direction and I had no idea what to choose, so I just chose the one that seemed the safer one.”</p>\n<p>But Ora said that earlier this year, the alternative resolution to handle the case internally failed. She described the Regents’ response to her allegation as “deeply disappointing.”</p>\n<p>“They were so invisible on any item that was clear to me that there was no use bothering to continue negotiation,” she said.</p>\n<p>Ora’s case will now move on to the outside investigation process.</p>\n<p>Ora told the Nexus she chose to speak during public forum due to frustration not only with the Regents’ system, but the entire University of California process for investigating sexual misconduct, which takes years and often re-traumatizes the person reporting sexual misconduct in the process.</p>\n<p>“We should have a system that doesn’t discourage and exhaust people who stand up for themselves and what’s right. And in order to protect other people, we should have a system that encourages them. This is not that system,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>At public forum, Ora discussed how the years-long investigation process has personally affected her, specifically her mental health and relationships.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been told not to bother trying to fix the world and told to let it go. I’ve been excluded from committees because of Kieffer’s presence, I experience regular panic attacks and have fallen behind in my academic progress. I’m afraid of being hacked and of being harassed and followed, as I’m aware other [people who reported sexual misconduct] have been. I had to move, I’ve lost friends and relationships,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Until now, I’ve tried to follow the appropriate process, but it has failed because it is fatally flawed,” Ora said during public forum.</p>\n<p>“I know that all the headlines have been about someone accuses someone of something. And I do think that is a problem, like yes, somebody did something to me … it did harm me. What I think is the larger and more long-term problem to fix is UC Regents wrote a policy for themselves that is unjust and inappropriate,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>“This all happening at this very moment that we have impeachment hearings going on in the government, we have to beg the question of what is oversight of power,” Ora said.</p>\n<p>“If the standards for them are lower than those for the rest of us, then we’re doing something horribly wrong.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

I feel that it is my duty to express my support for the impeachment of President Trump, as his actions affect my constituents lives.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution also discusses the whistleblower within the Trump Administration who </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/26/us/politics/whistle-blower-complaint.html?module=inline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">came forward</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in August with concerns about a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower accused Trump of pressuring Zelensky to gather damaging information on 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution calls Trump’s alleged actions “illegal” and writes that it is “Congress’s duty to impeach a President who commits high crimes and misdemeanors while in office.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It sets a bad precedent to allow a sitting President to commit crimes while in office and get away with it when the President of the United States is expected to abide by all of the laws of the United States of America,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ferguson emphasized in his email that he believes the Senate has a “moral responsibility” to pass the resolution and set a precedent for action on future national political decisions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With a school as politically engaged as UCSB, I think there is an importance of taking stances on major political issues like this,” Ferguson said. “I do believe the majority of the student body would support passing this resolution.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the passage of the resolution, Ferguson believes Senate will continue passing more resolutions around national political issues in the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do think we will feel more comfortable in the future as a Senate with taking stances on major political issues. I implore the Senate to consider discussing political issues further in the future as I believe all political actions should start at the grassroots level.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution can be viewed in full <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/A-Resolution-in-Support-of-Impeaching-and-Removing-President-Donald-J.-Trump-from-the-Office-of-President-of-the-United-States.pdf\">here</a>.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Bike Shop began its operations in 1974, working out of two corrugated steel shipping containers. The original facility had no running water or electricity, and structural decay posed threats to staff members and patrons, the report stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current building was created in 2008 to replace the shipping containers, adding plumbing and electricity and addressing the most shop’s critical needs. But what was meant to be a temporary solution has now been in place for over a decade. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building’s downfalls are especially felt during the beginning of fall quarter, senior mechanic and fourth-year earth science major Estefania Franco said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have tons of supplies and especially when it comes to fall quarter, we get extremely busy and it’s kind of hard to help others in maintaining their bikes because we can’t house that many bikes here, which we do in case people don’t have time to stay with us until their repair gets done or if it’s a little bit [of a] longer repair,” Franco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The community keeps growing, but the shop stays in this constant space that doesn’t allow us to help out the growing community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current attempt to find a permanent space for the bike shop is not the first. Previous A.S. presidents have incorporated plans for the space into redesigns of the University Center (UCen). Most recently, in spring 2018, President Hieu Le introduced a ballot measure to pay for the UCen redesign that would include a dedicated space for the bike shop, but when students voted not to move forward with renovations, the bike shop plans fell through.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until A.S. President Brooke Kopel, who served during the 2018-2019 academic year, took office that plans moved forward for a bike shop entirely separate from any other designs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel met last year with Mark Nocciolo, director of the Office of Budget and Planning, to discuss designs and locations. Nocciolo and Kopel intended to submit plans for the bike shop during spring of last year but were unable to when the last two campus planning committee meetings of the 2018-2019 year were cancelled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project has since moved forward into the current year, with current A.S. President Alison taking over for Kopel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They both have that sort of real conviction to get this done,” Nocciolo said. “And we’re doing all we can to make that happen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Campus Planning Committee approved plans to move forward with the bike shop during its Oct. 30 meeting and now plans to hire an architect to move forward with design and location plans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The committee for the bike shop’s permanent location is a collaboration with Sir, Nocciolo, others in the Campus Planning Committee, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and employees at the bike shop. The committee created a list of space needs for the building and new location, including bike path accessibility, a garage door, a safer location for test riders than the current parking lot, increased indoor space and bike-specific storage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Campus Planning Committee has opened the search to 11 sites, which may increase when an architect is hired, the bike shop identified four locations they would prefer: by the Thunderdome, by the Student Affairs Building, by the UCSB bus loop and in the Old Gymnasium Building. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of these four, Franco expressed that the Thunderdome is the preferred location of bike shop employees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It already has some good plumbing and electricity situations, which would make it really ideal, especially because since it is on campus, it would make a really easy kind of for everyone since it belongs to the school,” Franco said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the bike shop supports the Thunderdome location, Nocciolo has purposefully kept the location list open instead of recommending one for the Campus Planning Committee at this stage in the project. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our project proposal, we included all the sites that we looked at, and we did that so that the committee would recognize that this is a process that is going to have more than one set of eyes looking at it. We felt as if it made more sense for the committee to see the array of possible sites rather than saying it’s this site or that site or this other site,” Nocciolo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Nocciolo saw the immediate importance of a permanent shop location, he believes architects and the Campus Planning Committee must take into account the long-term growth of the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are instrumental in this activity; we will definitely want to have a committee involved, and students are always a part of these things. Student funds — they need to have a say. But we also need to have our eye on the long-term interests of the institution. We have a long range development plan that is going to live beyond us,” Nocciolo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want it to be in a place that makes sense for the long term so that it is indeed permanent and that we’re not asking to have it moved again. We don’t want to forego any future development that would be really important to the academic program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is also currently discussing master circulation of pathways, sidewalks, bike paths and roadways, according to the report, so Nocciolo doesn’t want any current bike shop plans to get in the way of other development projects in the works. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that an architect has been hired, Nocciolo says it is a “realistic goal” to have the project approved by the Campus Planning Committee by the end of the academic year, so construction can commence during the summer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For bike shop employees like Franco, the change can’t come soon enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The bike shop should grow as the community of biking grows. We see more and more students come in with bikes every year, but [our current location] is slowly limiting the amount of people we are able to help.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.
