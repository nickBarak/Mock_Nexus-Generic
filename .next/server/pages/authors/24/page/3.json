Based out of UC Davis, the program places an attorney at each UC campus who is available for legal assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the legal assistance, each UC has set aside resources for undocumented students, each with a program tailored to the needs of their respective campus. At UC Santa Barbara, this support comes from the Undocumented Student Services (USS). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, located on the second floor of the Student Resource Building,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was officially established in 2014 through funding from the Office of the President set aside specifically for undocumented student services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diana Valdivia, coordinator for Undocumented Student Services, works with seven student interns to help undocumented students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been working around undocumented students for five years, and prior to that I was organizing DACA legal clinics,” Valdivia said. “The passion of working with immigrant communities and having a masters in student affairs when these positions opened up were part of the reason for my interest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia has seen exponential growth in undocumented student services over the past three years in particular — both from overall growth of the new program as well as from heightened concerns from immigrant students when it was announced in 2017 that DACA would be rescinded, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When DACA was rescinded… we were seeing students [come in and] worry about, ‘What does that look like?’” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia’s goal with Undocumented Student Services is to provide a “different narrative” for the greater campus about what it means to be undocumented. Last year, USS hosted seven separate trainings for people to learn about laws and policies impacting immigrant communities, she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, each year during the third week of winter quarter, the center puts on an annual Immigration Awareness Week on campus, where it hosts a series of events to provide outreach about how to support the UCSB immigrant community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The services also offer a faculty mentorship program, which connects undocumented students to other students and faculty members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have socials for students, and then faculty also come to the socials, and then students get a chance to interact with them more in an informal mentor role,” Valdivia explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valdivia sees the connection between undocumented students and the greater UCSB population as beneficial to everyone, particularly as the Supreme Court goes through the DACA hearings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the times media might be focusing on the trauma, what it means to be undocumented and that’s totally valid,” Valvidia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[It’s important] for us to be able to provide a different narrative.”</span></p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-91085\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Aly Witmer and Hannah Appel / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case — Department of Homeland Security, et al. v. Regents of the University of California, et al. — has worked its way through the federal court system and is a combination of the University of California (UC) case as well as similar DACA cases in the District of Columbia and New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was created by an executive order under former President Barack Obama in 2012. The program provides two-year repeated deferments from deportation and a work permit to individuals who arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB74r7NE0A7btCgQX8od_5u0oogA\">website</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legal battle began in September 2017 when acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607871000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDw312g5cu8l9yoc1brbCBOrktxw\">announced</a> the Trump administration was ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just three days after the decision to end DACA was announced, the UC filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, becoming the “first university board to sue the government,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-filing-amicus-briefs-support-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607874000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcVJLBEAIOAKsdIDfspxkSgAjUuw\">press release</a> from the UC Office of the President (UCOP). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawsuit puts UC President Janet Napolitano in a unique position. As president, her office is leading the fight nationwide to protect DACA — the signature legislation she helped create in 2012 as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security for the Obama administration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Neither I, nor the University of California, take the step of suing the federal government lightly, especially not the very agency that I led,” Napolitano said. “To arbitrarily and capriciously end the DACA program, which benefits our country as a whole, is not only unlawful, it is contrary to our national values and bad policy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are nearly 700,000 DACA recipients currently in the program, which includes “approximately 1,700 UC students,” according to UCOP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC-DACA-Complaint.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607872000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbbp7en5OHiiYOlbelFwnekcqrXg\">lawsuit</a> alleges the Trump administration rescinded the program on “nothing more than unreasoned executive whim,” and that its removal is “unconstitutional, unjust, and unlawful.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal court granted an injunction to temporarily stop the Department of Homeland Security’s recission of DACA in January 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an unusual attempt, President Trump tried to bypass the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s hearing of the case, moving directly to the U.S. Supreme Court — but the justices denied his appeal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case went on as scheduled to the Ninth Circuit, and in November of 2018, the court ruled in favor of the UC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last June, the Supreme Court announced it would hear the DACA case in November 2019, beginning oral arguments this upcoming Tuesday, with expectations to have a decision in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case presents two specific questions: whether it is up to the courts to decide DACA’s fate, and if so, whether the decision to rescind the DACA program was “arbitrary and capricious.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is no dispute that this decision has life-changing implications for nearly 700,000 DACA participants and their families,” the Regent’s briefing <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/20190927151220415_18-587-Regents-Brief-for-Respondents.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607878000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEj-h4CmfaWS_4hT0IjEYZhwmfjMg\">reads</a>. “Yet the Acting Secretary provided only a single vague sentence of explanation for the decision that leaves basic questions unanswered.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-president-janet-napolitano-filing-supreme-court-brief-daca&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607876000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzPIBYHwjcOkR8r6nf7IsxddiKjQ\">statement</a> released in September, Napolitano argued that the Trump administration acted illegally because it offered no “valid justification” for ending the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Five federal courts have considered this issue and found that the administration’s decision was arbitrary and capricious, and therefore unlawful,” Napolitano said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The court briefing mentioned that the administration waited seven months to end the program and that Trump had previously indicated he “would allow DREAMers to stay.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Department of Homeland Security argued that DACA is illegal because it is a violation of immigration law and was enacted not through Congress, but as an executive order under former President Obama. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[DACA] was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,” said former acting Secretary of Homeland Security Duke in memorandum announcing DACA’s recission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the past month, UCOP began a system-wide campaign in support of DACA, including a social media campaign where prominent UC leaders and national politicians have given reasons for why they stand with DACA recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campaign also includes an online <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actnow.io/embed/widget/app/vwOv7u9?parentPage%3Dd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNpdHlvZmNhbGlmb3JuaWEuZWR1L2RhY2EtYnVpbGQ%253D%26frameId%3Dj1ild&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1573112607880000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKYXoHlNlEl8qhWsyHHYOGX-2YYA\">pledge</a>

Besides the court case, UC leaders are working with Congress to create bipartisan legislation providing long-term legal protections for DACA recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Supreme Court does not disclose dates for its decisions, but a ruling must be made before the end of its yearly term in June 2020. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Nov. 7, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

id=\"caption-attachment-90612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The exhibit uses photographs, articles and other items from the university archives. <em>Katherine Swartz/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Located on the third floor of the Davidson Library, the exhibit uses photographs, articles and other items from the university archives to show the changes in UCSB’s academic reputation in the 75 years since UCSB joined the UC system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Stahl, who became the first dedicated university archivist of UCSB in 2017, was in charge of designing and curating the exhibit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wanted to pay homage to some of the institutions before, but there have been a lot of exhibits already in the library about the Anna Blake school and other preceding institutions. So we didn’t want to get bogged down in the pre-history of the institution,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exhibit is sorted by decade from the 1940s onwards. Some of the earlier decades include digitized copies of old photographs and poster copies of the El Gaucho student newspaper, which was an early iteration of what is now known as the Daily Nexus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the other exhibits that we’ve done, they draw from … maybe one or two collections. For this one, I mean we have 130 different collections from just the university archives … Some of them are huge, some of them are just like one or two boxes, but I mean there was a lot more material to sift through,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We had to make sure that it stuck with the story of the exhibit. And the story of the exhibit is how did this little sleepy beachside college grow from being a small liberal arts college to a world-class research leader. So we had to make sure that all the things we wanted to put in the exhibit related to that transition.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key element to UCSB’s transformation was the dissolution of the home economics department and the creation of the Black studies, Chicana and Chicano studies and environmental studies departments in the late 1960s. The shift in curriculum during the period was the academic response to the broader cultural change in UCSB’s student body during the time period, according to Stahl.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl notes through the exhibit a “crisis” of declining enrollment throughout the 1970s following the Bank of America burning and Isla Vista riots of 1970. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if our reputation [was] suffering, I think you can look at it best as growing pains, that the university was really trying to find its new identity and struggle with what kind of institution it’s supposed to be,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the first half of the exhibit — up to the 1970s — uses photographs and documents from that time, Stahl found there were less archival documents from the 1980s to now. Because there was no university archivist until Stahl was hired in 2017, departments and organizations were responsible for archiving their own work — which often was not properly preserved, if archived at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We didn’t have enough material necessarily to have a case for each decade,” Stahl said. “So we from this point changed it to research focus, like what have we done well in the field of research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three displays for the 1980s to the present include a dedication to achievements in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">science, technology, engineering and mathematics (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S.T.E.M.), one for research in the social sciences and humanities and a third displaying photos of UCSB’s six Nobel Laureates, along with a bronze duplicate Nobel Prize provided by former physics professor Walter Kohn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the modern exhibit section focuses on research, Stahl hopes that the exhibit will help UCSB student and faculty leaders understand the importance of archiving their work for future years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing I would have liked to have more of, for example, would be student organization materials in the exhibit. But we don’t have a lot of materials from [Associated Students] clubs and so basically student organizations don’t always know the best way to preserve their materials,” Stahl said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Hopefully this will kind of generate awareness there that if you’re a student organization on campus and you have historical records, we are willing and able to preserve them for you here.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stahl and his team of curators — </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special Collections Librarians David Gartrell and Yolanda Blue and Processing Archivist Leland Riddlesperger </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> strived through Campus by the Sea to not only focus on UCSB’s previous evolution into a research institution but also what lies ahead in the university’s future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The curators incorporated this element through photographs of current students on a wall in the exhibit. Students answered questions about how their university experience has shaped them and their hopes for the future of UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yolanda Blue noticed that as UCSB’s population continued to grow since it first became a UC, so has its reputation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus started as a small liberal arts campus, very small in concept and focus. And now, 75 years later, we’re known worldwide as a world-class research university. The growth – how the campus has transitioned over the years in spite of all the different events that have taken place,” Blue said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve acquired so many different departments and Nobel Prize winners … it’s inspirational, as you can tell from the comments made by the students that we interviewed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening reception for Campus by the Sea will be held on Thursday from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Special Research Collections area of the library on the third floor mountain side. An open house will also be held on Nov. 1 from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exhibit will be open on the third floor in the Special Research Collections until July and can also be viewed digitally through the Campus by the Sea website.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Others began pointing fingers at specific fraternities on Twitter; although unconfirmed, some tweets went viral. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A timely warning from the university is a product of deliberation and consideration, according to Miles Ashlock, associate dean and director of the Office of Student Life (OSL). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university elicits a timely warning on a “case-by-case basis” based on factors surrounding the incident, which include “the nature of the crime, the serious or continuing threat to the campus community, and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to release the timely warning with undisclosed information stems from the Clery Act, a campus security law that aims to facilitate transparency in campus crimes and statistics, according to the Clery Act’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://clerycenter.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571898031086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHySLJ3MlOIp8a4Zzggc0tQ8AZzXw\">website</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, student leaders in registered campus organizations, such as a fraternities or sororities, are not mandated to report instances of sexual violence and sexual harassment and instead attend annual trainings “in interpersonal violence prevention strategies,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a crime occurs on “Clery geography,” which, according to the Clery Act’s website, includes non-campus buildings “owned or controlled by a student organization,” the university makes a judgment call to “evaluate if there is a serious or ongoing threat to the campus community,” Ashlock said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In our communications, we strive to be sensitive to the impact that the message may have on survivors and to be careful not to create the potentially false sense of security (by naming one location over another, particularly when we may not have sufficient information to like the offense to a particular residence),” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students President Alison Sir said she met with campus administrators following the release of the timely warning out of concern for survivors and those unaffiliated with Greek life who feel “uncomfortable” about the situation. In a meeting with Assistant Vice Chancellor &amp; Dean of Student Life Katya Armistead and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn, Sir said she learned the timely warning was not specific to one fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The timely warning is about multiple IFC frats and frats outside [of IFC] — like in [multi-cultural] groups. [The university] didn’t want to release the names because I know a lot of students are angry about that because they’re all under investigation,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also addressed the “victim-blaming” nature of the timely warning’s “safety tips,” which she said the university opted to include after learning of one allegation that claimed a fraternity had laced a bottle marked with an “X” on it and would choose “who would get [the bottle] or not.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was basically IFC frats and frats outside of IFC as well, nothing was finalized [and] they were still investigating, so they didn’t want to release any names of people involved.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Sir addressed Senate regarding the timely warning. She said she is working with Klawunn and Armistead to develop a “task force” of administration members, community leaders and students to review policies and practices addressing sexual violence in I.V.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir told senators that the task force will “encourage safer behavior and develop better response practices.” At this time, Sir was unsure who would be appointed to the task force, but said she will ensure that every “stakeholder” in the issue would be involved in the task force. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When further questioned by Senator Benjamin Chocron, Sir added that these stakeholders include IFC and Panhellenic members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir also advertised an upcoming Sexual Assault Town Hall, hosted by Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) – to be held on Nov. 14 at 6 p.m. in Corwin Pavilion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The news brought by the timely warning drew an immediate response of “abhorrence and disgust” in the eyes of SASA’s president, Alia Reynolds, a third-year global studies and philosophy double major. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We condemn any and all individuals or organizations which knowingly allow such actions to take place, or foster an environment which allows individuals to feel they can take such actions,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many students who spoke up on social media, Reynolds concluded that the university’s response was “not adequate” and that “[SASA] firmly advocate[s] for the university to release the name of the fraternity organization[s] associated with the incident.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reynolds said SASA has created a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sasa-ca.org/index.php/svsh-map/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571899623049000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3PY3zJdSKCobVCHpizGDfPV5mTg\">“Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Map”</a> which allows survivors to “anonymously submit the date, location and any details they wish to disclose about an instance” of sexual violence or sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The frequency of incidents similar to those described by the timely warning call for “a larger conversation regarding the prevalent cultural and social context within Isla Vista and many other communities,” Reynolds said. “We believe a larger cultural shift in accountability </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must take place within our community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, a message responding to the timely warning was chalked </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and quickly washed away </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a sidewalk adjacent to fraternity Sigma Pi, emboldened with the words “hold frats accountable.” The chalking belonged to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/catcallsofsantabarbara/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1571899698047000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNB-6PuIpmW2S0nHEJL271ArepsA\">@catcallsofsantabarbara</a>, an Instagram account that posts anonymously submitted stories of sexual harassment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two representatives of the account, who wish to remain anonym</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ous to avoid retaliation, told the Nexus they first heard about the timely warning after receiving multiple screenshots of the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After speaking with a “few members of the Greek community,” one representative of the account said they were under the impression that Sigma Pi was the fraternity mentioned in the timely warning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two days after making a post about an incident at Sigma Pi, the representatives received information that contradicted their original beliefs regarding the fraternity, subsequently leading them to retract any posts implicating the fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conflicting information, which came from a “very credible source,” made it clear to the representatives that the situation ran “a lot deeper than we expected” and was not limited to one specific fraternity, the two stated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday, the Instagram account announced a “boycott” against Sigma Pi, where they planned to march from Sea Lookout Park to the Sigma Pi house, but the march was cancelled “to give time for the victims to heal,” a post on the account’s page read. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many on social media, Spencer Brandt, board president for the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), said he was “horrified” by the timely warning and supports students’ calls for the university “to name the fraternit[ies]” where the incidents occurred.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD is partnering with Standing Together to End Sexual Assault, an organization dedicated to providing counseling and support services to survivors of sexual assault, Brandt added. The </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/csd-finalizes-contract-with-ucpd-for-interpersonal-violence-investigator/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interpersonal violence investigator program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a collaboration with the UC Police Department and I.V. CSD, has been in place since 2018 to investigate cases relating to sexual violence, according to Brandt. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The truth is that no one deserves to be made into a survivor. We all need to take a hard look at the I.V. culture and ask ourselves what about it enables so much sexual violence.” </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence and Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><i>Correction [Oct. 24, 1:26 a.m.]: A previous version of this article stated that President Alison Sir partnered with SASA for the Survivor Town Hall.

Not Pictured: ON-Campus Senator Ashley Davis. <em>Katherine Swartz / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These vacancies were created during the Spring Quarter 2019 Associated Student (A.S.) elections, after only three candidates ran for five on-campus seats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The appointment of a College of Creative Studies senator marks the first time this seat has been filled in two years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of the 70th Senate term in Spring Quarter of 2019, Internal Vice President Alli Adam created an ad-hoc committee to find and nominate students to fill the three vacancies. Instead of a general election, the three new senators were chosen through an application and interview process by the ad-hoc committee before being officially appointed this Wednesday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a huge accomplishment. Senates in the past have tried to fill seats to no avail, and the fact that you were able to fill the seats in week four </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marisela and I are very proud,” Adam said to senators during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Tianna White led the ad-hoc committee and announced in her report on Wednesday that the three senators have “fully met the standard” of legal code with eligibility. White took a “holistic approach” in the interview process for candidates, reviewing past leadership, involvement, project goals and what they plan to bring to Senate. </span></p>\n<p><b>On-Campus Senator Anvitha Aluri </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anvitha Aluri, a second-year biology major, was appointed for one of two vacant on-campus senator positions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wanted to just apply because I feel like there’s so many things on campus that I see my friends are talking about, what they wish could be better. And I feel like if I could kind of help bring some of their concerns forward too, that’s why [I applied].“</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her free time, Aluri volunteered at a local middle school students and at the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center. It was her volunteer experience there that showed Aluri the importance of resources for sexual assault survivors, something she plans to carry into her term by advocating for more resources for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.R.E.) and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C.A.P.S.). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like if there was a better way of … being easier for someone just to come in or even anonymously talk to someone. I think it would make people feel a lot more safe.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Aluri’s main concerns she finds with the university is the high price of on-campus housing. Aluri expressed that campus housing is more expensive than living off-campus, but for some students with scholarships, that is their only option. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One particular element of Aluri’s on-campus housing initiative is changing the meal plan requirement for students. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They shouldn’t make you get a meal plan. I guess I kind of understand how they need to make people have meal plans, but they can also change the system to Gaucho bucks or something like that where I feel like it would just be as easy to use it rather than [being] forced to get a meal plan.”</span></p>\n<p><b>On-Campus Senator Ashley Davis </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ashley Davis was first approached about running for senate by current off-campus senator Eric Moon during last year’s spring elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Davis, a second-year sociology major, felt her other commitments during her freshman year kept her from “doing a full election and campaigning.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis previously served as a desk attendant for San Nicolas residence hall, was a Real Talk facilitator for her residence hall last year, currently serves as a house manager for the Department of Theater and Dance, serves as the administrative vice president of the Residential Housing Association and is the external coordinator for the Queer Commission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I always had in the back of my mind as something that I’d be doing like my junior or senior year and not something that would happen this quickly,” Davis said. “But I really like the idea of being influential on campus, representing students that weren’t typically represented on this kind of scale.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Davis said she is still “getting [her] bearings and doing research” about what issues senators are already addressing, but she is “excited to get more information firsthand.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some issues she expressed an interest in are environmental justice and LGBTQ visibility and rights by working with the Trans Task Force and Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Personally, I hope that I can be an active member of the communities that I already participate in and an ally for those that I don’t.”</span></p>\n<p><b>College of Creative Studies Senator Daniel Mitchell</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Mitchell first considered running for an off-campus senate seat for the 2020-2021 term, until he heard from current on-campus senator Emma Swanson that a seat was currently open to represent the College of Creative Studies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Representing CCS seems like a lot cooler opportunity personally for me, especially to incorporate the artsy part of CCS into my A.S. work.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell, a second-year CCS music composition major, hopes to blend his passions for the arts and public policy to help CCS and Letters and Science artists collaborate on new projects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell says he has a “passion” for public service and told senators that he grew up volunteering for political campaigns with his family. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s this same element of teamwork that drew him towards being an A.S. Senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this is a good place to start because [UCSB] is a small community, but if I’m serious about running for other elected offices, I think this is a good way to start to get a sense of what legislating is like.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell hopes to run for Isla Vista Community Services District after he graduates and eventually State Assembly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was involved with Campus Democrats and Chamber Choir last year and currently serves with Lobby Corps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitchell’s two main goals for the year are expanding arts programming and environmental justice work.

Food Bank area. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></span></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Basic Needs Resource Center (BNRC) would place various Associated Students (A.S.) resource entities under the purview of the current A.S. Food Bank, which would be renamed to the “A.S. Food Bank and Basic Needs Resource Center” and include the A.S. Food Bank, Child Care Grant, A.S./Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) Emergency Grants, the Community Financial Fund Grant and the Graduate Student Association Food Pantry, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. President Alison Sir began working on the BNRC over the summer along with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So Marisela and I created a proposal this summer when we realized that this $1.2 million from UC Office of the President was going to be sent to each campus, and we decided this would be a great opportunity for A.S. Food Bank,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the opportunity to centralize A.S. basic needs resources, Sir hopes the center will eventually consolidate financial workshops and CalFresh advocates in one place for students to access. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BNRC would not be in a different location but would move into the current A.S. Food Bank area. One key element of the BNRC is a case management system, which would track what students are accessing in order to assess student needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution was authored by On-Campus Senator Adalis Rojas and seconded by Off-Campus Senator Kimia Hadidi and calls senators to “support its expansion and work to reach out to the UCSB community about these opportunities,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas’ resolution also addresses a separate A.S. project </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an A.S. book grant, which will provide funding for students to purchase textbooks.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas told her fellow senators during Wednesday’s meeting that this resolution is a way to “centralize what students’ needs are instead of everything being scattered about.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I spoke to Alison and Marisela and we did consider making it two separate resolutions, but they both advised for me to just include it under one, so that’s just how it came out to be,” Rojas said to the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said one of her key senate campaign platforms was textbook affordability, so when  Márquez approached Senate last week about authoring resolutions for the BNRC and the A.S. Book Bank, she decided to write both into one resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do know that food insecurity and textbook affordability is a huge, popular issue among the senators that we all want to solve,” Rojas said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution states that the current EOP Emergency Grant can be used for textbooks but only if a textbook has been lost, damaged or stolen </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not in the case of students who cannot afford textbooks at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has not yet announced how the new book grant funds will be allocated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Wednesday’s Senate meeting, Hadidi referenced last Friday’s Basic Needs Town Hall, held at Corwin Pavilion, where students addressed both campus and local leaders about accessibility to basic resources to combat food insecurity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many students have a lot of issues with what’s going on in their lives on campus. I think there’s a lot of concerns about housing and homelessness for students and right now we can’t address that, so I think supporting this resolution is really important,” Hadidi said to her fellow senators during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir has not unveiled a timeline for either the BNRC or the book grant to be set in motion. Currently, Márquez and Sir are working to source more contribution from financial boards for the BNRC and are trying to gain more student support for both of the measures. </span></p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence contributed reporting. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 10, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Once the volunteer arrived to the beach a few hours later, he confirmed to Rogers that the sea lion was suffering from domoic acid toxicosis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Domoic acid toxicosis starts at the bottom of the food chain, found among the phytoplankton called pseudo-nitzschia. Through biomagnification, the toxicity of this harmful algal bloom — a rapid growth of algae in a small area — becomes more concentrated in animals as it goes from krill to small fish and sardines to the California sea lion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The volunteer] was describing to me how it literally shrinks the size of the sea lion hippocampi … and for the rest of the hour I just listened to him off the edge of my seat with my mouth hanging open,” Rogers explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The way he was describing [the sea lion’s] mental state, he equated it to human dementia and was telling me she doesn’t know that she’s a sea lion and she doesn’t know where she is. She doesn’t know that she needs to hunt, she doesn’t know what fish are.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When CIMWI gets a call about domoic acid toxicosis in animals, a volunteer arrives at the scene to assess the animal, but they usually keep the animal in its immediate surroundings instead of relocating to the rehabilitation facility in order prevent further disorientation. The sea lion is left “in a safety perimeter” and volunteers regularly monitor the animal’s condition, according to signs CIMWI posted along I.V. beaches over the weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While domoic acid toxicosis seriously impacts the affected sea lion’s health, acute effects dissipate after 72 hours as the toxin works its way through the animal’s body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effects of domoic acid go beyond sea lion health on the Central Coast. Mussels and other shellfish feed on pseudo-nitzschia, which is potentially deadly to humans if they eat affected mussels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we were to say, eat mussels that have been filtering and feeding on pseudo-nitzschia that happen to be toxic … we would pick up those toxins as well,” said Mark Brzezinski, professor of biological oceanography and director of the Marine Science Institute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“That’s why when domoic acid levels are high, the shellfish harvesting is put on hold, because those could be poisonous.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While studies clearly indicate a rise in domoic acid due to climate and human-generated issues, there’s not a simple connection between a changing atmosphere and preventing outbreaks of domoic acid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Brzezinski explained, the pseudo-nitzschia phytoplankton does not always produce the toxin, so researchers find it nearly impossible to predict when and where algal blooms will be toxic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because it’s in the water doesn’t mean it’s producing the toxin </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that’s one of the frustrating things. We monitor the amounts of pseudo-nitzschia in the water every week; we take a sample on Monday, and by Tuesday we have the answer. But we also know that the relationship between the number of pseudo-nitzschia out there and toxicity is really poor. The numbers don’t predict toxicity. We can’t infer the toxic bloom just from the number of organisms out there, which is a little frustrating, but we have to be careful interpreting abundance data.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, the same species can be toxic one day and not the other. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not known in a well enough way that, ‘This group’s going to be toxic and that group over there’s not.’ We’re not at that point. It’s one of the areas that people who do this full time are really focused in on, to try and understand that, because it’s a major gap in our knowledge.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With any future sea lion sightings, CIMWI warns beachgoers to keep their distance even if the sea lion appears approachable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But from what Rogers witnessed on the beach, it will take a lot of diligence for students to keep their space from rare close encounters with marine wildlife.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think that we live in a very voyeuristic society, particularly with the rise of like heavy documentation of our lives and the things we see. I’d be remiss to say it wasn’t connected to social media,” Rogers said. “But I also do think there’s a kind of benign interest in natural phenomenon, like with a growing disconnect between us and the environment and I think that people are interested in kind of bridging that gap for themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rogers waited hours by the sea lion for CIMWI, telling students to keep their space. For her, the change from her daily routine was a reminder for her to remain active in the fight against climate change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had a moment of reckoning where I was on my second hour of waiting for CIMWI and I was kind of like, ‘Okay, this is taking a long time, I’m dedicating a lot of time to this.’ I was questioning myself, does my emotional response to these kinds of things hinder me or is it a strength? Because I was feeling very drained by the fact that I was watching the sea lion and I didn’t know her fate and I was having this reckoning with myself.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just hope that students hear this call-to-arms and remain helpful in order to be productive and when they feel this emotional hole to notice and bear witness to what’s happening in the environment. I hope that students follow the path of action rather than the path of denial and paralyzation and don’t let themselves be overwhelmed by what’s happening, but instead let themselves be motivated and kind of be sparked to action and to making change.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

But these national events weren’t just headlines to the students of UCSB; at the time, male college-aged students were being drafted in droves for the Vietnam War, the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill saw an outage that would later lead to the modern environmental movement and four college students had been killed by National Guard soldiers during an anti-war protest at Kent State in Ohio. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista quickly became a countercultural hub, in part because of the high student population and small-town nature that made the area a breeding ground for political activism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We just felt like the country was on the verge of a revolution. It was easier to feel that way when we’re all in a center of a refuge of like-minded people like here in Isla Vista,” Steve Byrd, who attended UCSB between 1965 and 1970, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The anti-war movement at UCSB and Isla Vista differentiated from movements at other universities during the period, Byrd said, in part because of the violent tensions that led to the burning of the local Bank of America building, the death of a student by the hands of police and the deployment of the national guard by then-governor Ronald Reagan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd, a senior at the time, had a front row seat for it all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He described the hippie movement in the area as “peaceful” — at least until January 1970. The rest of the 1969-1970 academic year was marked by three distinctive phases of rioting, culminating in June with the arrival of the National Guard and the arrest of 10% of Isla Vista’s population one week before final exams, Byrd said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event that sparked the violence of 1970 is arguably the most nationally well-known event in the university’s history: the burning of the Bank of America building in Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The government was continuing the same old way … they just wouldn’t change. They just kept on doing the same thing, kept on being involved in the same imperialistic overseas wars, no matter how much people protest it.

They broke windows, grabbed furniture out of the building and made a large pile, lighting it on fire. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediately, police from surrounding towns were brought in the area, and Byrd remembers their “aggressive” behavior toward all of Isla Vista. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They didn’t know Isla Vista at all, they just knew the stereotypes and they were pissed off. They were pissed off to be here and maybe fearful and scared and they became very aggressive with us, very, very aggressive with us.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After three days, students “ran [the police] out of town,” according to Byrd. But the violence of 1970 was far from over. Just a couple months later, in mid-April, police killed UCSB student Kevin Moran who went to help put out fires started by rioters. Moran shouted, “Don’t shoot at us — we’re putting the fire out!” according to El Gaucho, a former version of the Daily Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Byrd, police initially tried to blame Moran’s death on student snipers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They told all the students snipers had done it for the first several days and things like that. And then it only came out out over time that the police were the one who had actually done it. But then the thing was [the officer] was never indicted for it.

This stemmed from a deeper distrust he observed between the older and younger generations during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We used to get stopped by the police all the time, you know, just for being young, just for being counter-cultural looking a little bit. I really noticed the difference now that I get older, because I’m just not stopped for no reason like I was when I was young.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During an especially tumultuous period at the end of June, right before finals, over 1,000 people were arrested in Isla Vista for violating a temporary curfew, including Byrd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd recounted his own experience of being arrested for being out past curfew, describing the “aggressive” nature of policing at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The police would go and start ‘bam, bam, bam’ on your apartment door. They’d knocked down the door and to smithereens. And they’d bust in and people would be hiding underneath their beds and in the shower in the bathroom. They’d come and then they say you’re violating curfew after they yanked them outside of their own house and then take them away to jail.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd said he was held overnight with “40 people in a cell for four people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were just crammed in like sardines into a cell where you couldn’t even lay down or even hardly sit down,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were violating the Constitution. They were inflicting punishment before trial, before being found guilty, just inflicting their own revenge kind of punishment on arrest.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The perceptions of Byrd and students at the time weren’t reflected in the national media coverage over the course of the 1969-1970 year; a New York Times column published in August 1970 described Isla Vista as a “ghetto,” blaming students for the violence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The mere words ‘University of California’ on the ballot, in the current public mood, would probably doom a modest subsidy to cure cancer,” columnist Winthrop Griffith wrote at the time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Byrd believes the media focused solely on the violence, ignoring the peaceful protesting of students and deep political values against the war that motivated their actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was a stereotype that sold newspapers. It’s so media, you know, it’s the way the news media always is. They write up the sensationalistic thing to get readership up. And by stirring the pot, by making the young people into the troublemakers and everything, it’s just a stereotype that most older people had,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw the value of the counter cultural revolution, that peace and love and anti-militarism or values, that were worth pursuing, not just because we were young, but they were lifelong values that were worth pursuing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This five year-period of history of UCSB’s, and the nation’s country, may as well be a snapshot in history — a time when the country was at war and the culture was rapidly changing. Isla’s Vista’s student-dominant environment stood out against the landscape of Goleta and Santa Barbara, where adults looked down on the “hippie” look and lifestyle of UCSB students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All the young people clustered here and they feel like this was their safe space, in Isla Vista,” Byrd said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I first came to Isla Vista in 1965, it was a very different place, almost a 1950s preppy place. Then it changed just in a couple of years to this big hippie revolution and all the countercultural revolution.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

The deeply personal documentary follows Crosby along his latest solo music tour, while diving into his past in Crosby Stills Nash and Crosby Stills Nash and Young. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that Crosby is alive, let alone has maintained his clear harmonizing voice well after his glory days of the ‘70s and ‘80s, is a miracle noted by television interviews, individuals featured in the film and Crosby himself. He is of course known today for his memorable career as a singer-songwriter, but also for his heroin and cocaine addictions and famed run from the law. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released this summer about the ‘70s and ‘80s singer Linda Ronstadt </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> feels so different from “Remember My Name</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because of Ronstadt’s silence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s considerable intersection between the careers of Linda Ronstadt and David Crosby. Both came out of high school to the late-1960s Los Angeles music scene with a burning passion to share their voice, trying to carve their way into a path dominated by the British music invasion as well as the national tumult post-Vietnam. Singer-songwriter rock was king, and Crosby and Ronstadt frequented many of the same music clubs like the Troubadour and befriended icons like Mama Cass and Joni Mitchell, hoping to break their way in. Both artists quickly did — Ronstadt through her successful solo career including hits like “Blue Bayou” and “You’re No Good” and Crosby under The Byrds; Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (CSN); and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (CSNY). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Crosby and Ronstadt have a unique talent and voice. Both have bold, larger-than-life personalities, daring to take creative risks and to speak their mind about politics and overall not giving a damn. Both had a distaste for touring, or anything that distracted from the heart and soul of their passion —  making music. Both shared a deep loneliness throughout their career. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But looking at “Remember My Name”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and “The Sound of My Voice”, that’s where the similarities end. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the two performers may be from the same era, in 2019 they lead entirely different lives, and the two documentaries produced are stylized to reflect that difference; Crosby still louder than life, Ronstadt now silent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ronstadt’s lack of appearance throughout the documentary can be traced to the abrupt end of her career eight years ago due toParkinson’s disease. “The Sound of My Voice” is about looking back on the time Ronstadt had, a closing bow to her successful career and the legacy she’s left behind. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We see Ronstadt’s vivacious spirit not through her present but through her past, specifically in television interview clips and concert recordings. But the prime stylistic difference in the Ronstadt and Crosby documentaries is their physical presence in the film. We only actually see the current Ronstadt in the beginning and the end of the film. She’s been exceptionally private since her 2011 Parkinson’s diagnosis and didn’t allow an on-camera interview for the film. The sound of her voice is heard throughout the film (making the film’s title that much more fitting) through narration from one topic to the next, but the end result reflects the guarded nature of the subject. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Remember My Name”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the exact opposite. Crosby himself drives the film, and the result feels far more autobiographical than Ronstadt’s film. In one particularly exceptional section of the film, Crosby is in the back seat of a car, stopping at some of the most prolific spots in the Los Angeles and Laurel Canyon area that shaped his career. He’s never one to shy from intimacy, and some of the most touching and candid discussions of those he’s hurt in the past come outside a small country store, what he calls the “least cinematic” of places. There’s a spontaneity to having a quasi-unreliable narrator as your star, and Crosby never hides from his fall from grace. Director A.J. Eaton, along with executive producer Cameron Crowe, establish a close rapport with Crosby, making you feel like you truly understand Crosby’s story by the time the credits roll. Eaton told Melena Ryzik, New York Times culture reporter, that his relationship unfolded naturally with Crosby: “the music was fresh, he was trying new things, and we became friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Remember My Name”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is not Crosby’s final bow, but the opening of an entirely new second act. Crosby’s not done with his life; his solo career is proving what he can do with the time he has left. It’s the opposite of slowing down; he has produced four albums in the past four years and is currently working on his fifth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key stylistic difference between the two films is how their stories are told. Because Ronstadt wasn’t interviewed for the film, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman supplement partially with old footage of Ronstandt, but mainly through interviews of others, including former bandmates and collaborators. And not one has a bad thing to say about Linda. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Crosby stands alone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Remember My Name” features few and far between interviews of other people, and Eaton didn’t even ask the members of CSNY to be in the film. The film isn’t a reflection (like with Ronstadt’s film), but a way for Crosby to share his side of the story. Just like with every other topic he tackles, Crosby is candid about his estrangement from Neil Young, Graham Nash and Stephen Stills, as well as other big music names who he fought throughout his career and addictions. Crosby’s story is a fall from grace and a decades-in-the-making rise. Ronstadt never falters. She just sings until she tragically can’t. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When comparing the films, you can’t help but see the irony in where the two rock stars have landed based on where they’ve been. If the world was just, it would be Ronstadt still singing; she steered clear of the male-dominated rock scene fueled by hard drugs and rock star image in favor of keeping her voice clean. Instead, she is left silenced by Parkinson’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The rock and roll culture seems to be dominated by hostility against women. What happens is they lose the ability to focus on themselves as a person, rather than as an image,” Ronstandt says to a reporter in an old interview along the Malibu coast in her beachside home. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crosby in his prime rockstar era was the type of man Ronstadt references in that interview. He spent his prime years “smashed,” as he often describes in the film, and CSN and CSNY was built on an image that looked ideal from the outside but was actually filled with decades-long hostility culminating in their 2016 breakup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering Crosby’s rock star attitude, and especially his heavy drug usage, he should be the one silenced — not Ronstadt. Yet he still has time to sing, and the core of “Remember My Name” is how Crosby’s second act is a refusal to give up his voice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coincidentally, the films share a handful of producing credits: Gabriel Caste, Alex Exline, Michele Farinola and James Keach (both films were made by his production company, PCH Films). Editor Veronica Pinkham also worked on both films, as a co-editor on “Remember My Name” and additional editing on “The Sound of My Voice”. Cameron Crowe, a prominent music journalist and filmmaker from the 1970s, was interviewed for “The Sound of My Voice” and was a producer on “Remember My Name,” interviewing Crosby himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the two share behind the scenes in no way leads to a similar final products of the films. That’s the beauty of documentaries — that these two stories, which on the surface appear the same, about rock stars from the same era grappling with fame and all it entails, quickly blossom into completely different films that set out with completely different aims and ways of achieving them. Both do their subjects the justice they so deserve. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Correction [Oct. 2, 11:42 p.m.]: A previous version of this article did not include that Michele Farinola and Veronica Pinkham worked on both films, and stated Crowe was an executive producer for “Remember My Name”.

He also had “a dirty white beard, [was] wearing mussed clothing or dirty in appearance.” He may be driving an older, four-door gray car that looks “similar to a Chevy Volt.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first victim said her attacker “smelled heavily of alcohol”; the second said he smelled like marijuana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Tuesday evening, he has not been apprehended. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first assault occurred on Saturday afternoon around 12:30 p.m. along a creek near Phelps Road and Ocean Walk Lane, when the suspect grabbed a 22-year-old female jogger by the shoulder and arm “in an attempt to pull her closer to him,” according to an initial </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-08-10/timely-warning-issued-for-assault-on-campus-adjacent-property/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timely warning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent out by UCSB on Saturday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victim punched at the suspect in an attempt to break free, but the suspect then “grabbed the victim by her shoulders and punched her in the face,” according to the initial timely warning.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students in the Freshman Summer Start Program (FSSP) ⁠— a program that allows first-year UCSB students the chance to move in early and take one session of summer classes with the aim of easing them into UCSB ⁠— have historically lived in San Nicolas Hall, and in recent years, have stayed in that hall for their entire first year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this year, 100 slots in San Miguel Hall, San Nicholas’ neighbor, will be open to FSSP students who are interested in moving into another residence hall during the school year. Those 100 students will live in San Miguel during the summer and move into one of the other six residence halls ⁠— Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Manzanita Village, Santa Catalina, San Rafael or Santa Cruz ⁠—  once Fall Quarter 2019 begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change, said William Jankowski, associate director of UCSB’s Residential &amp; Community Living, was made so that students who wanted to live in other residence halls would still be able to participate in FSSP.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jankowski explained that every year, his department receives requests from FSSP students to live in residence halls other than San Nicholas for the academic year, particularly from students wanting to room with individuals who are not in FSSP and who are living in other residence halls. Non-FSSP students typically move into different residence halls the week before Fall Quarter 2019 begins. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the past, students have had to choose [between FSSP and their friends],” Jankowski said.  “We’re excited this year that we can allow students to move into a different residence hall after FSSP, and opening up FSSP to San Miguel allows us to do this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While students in FSSP are typically known for remaining together in San Nicolas for the entire year, this change is not unprecedented, according to Gallucci. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the program first began in 2002 with 210 students, most students moved out of San Nicolas for the following fall quarter. The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ultimate goal was to fill both San Nicolas and San Miguel with 800 to 1000 students for the summer, who would then move to different residence halls in the fall, he explained. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Gallucci said that “around six or seven years ago,” Housing &amp; Residential Services changed the program to keep students together in San Nicolas for the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They wanted to try a different system, thinking that perhaps living together for a whole year would consolidate those friendships,” he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the program has grown over the past 17 years, with a projected total of 540 students this year </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">number on par with last year’s cohort of 540, which was about 10% of the class of 2022 ⁠— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the UCSB Summer Sessions office and Housing &amp; Residential Services have worked together closely to accommodate the program’s growing popularity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s slow going, because it’s hard to convince all the students that this is such a good program, because a lot of students think it’s academic boot camp,” Gallucci said. “They don’t realize how fun it can be as well. Our students have the highest GPA of any group on campus, 3.57 this past summer … they graduate at triple, sometimes quadruple, the rate of non-FSSP cohorts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gallucci calls this year’s expansion to San Miguel a “test year.” Both Gallucci and UCSB’s Housing &amp; Residential Services hope that more FSSP students will be able to live in San Miguel as the program continues to grow in the coming years. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

Before that, it was the gangster and mob craze kicked off by “The Godfather.” And before that, audiences of the ‘40s were enticed by big-budget romantic epics like “Gone with the Wind” that have since gone out of style with modern audiences. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These blink-and-you-miss-them genres will always be a part of film.

At its best, it’s a flashy but fun story that relies on audience appeal. At its worst, it’s cheap filmmaking using songs as a crutch, fitting the lives of some of the most famous modern musicians into a simple three-act structure: the meteoric rise of the star, their eventual fall and the resolution that they have emotionally bettered themselves and risen to power once again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On first view, I loved the musical biopics of this past year. I remember walking out of the theater after each of these films with a huge smile on my face, exhilarated by the music and production. But the rush when I first left the theater didn’t last. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For obvious reasons, only the highlights of these musicians’ long and winding careers are capitalized in their films. “Bohemian Rhapsody”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">makes brief reference to Freddie Mercury’s less successful solo work, but for the most part, these films act like a cinematic translation of a greatest hits CD. In reality, there is complexity not only of the artists but of their actual music. The biopic genre reflects the trials and tribulations of the artists, but their work is always impeccable; filmmakers have no need to include backtracks and unpopular endeavors that a mainstream audience wouldn’t recognize. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Musical biopics often fail because instead of using music to make a more innovative story, they let the use of popular music hold them back. Am I watching a two hour jukebox karaoke stream, or is the film really using music to tell its story? The answer is far more the former than the latter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least “Yesterday”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and “Rocketman”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">take minimal risks, with “Yesterday” telling an original story through Beatles discography and “Rocketman”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">through bold risks in narrative structures. “Bohemian Rhapsody”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not, yet it has come away with numerous awards and accolades. Don’t ask me how. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89296\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"807287304\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89288\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89296\" data-attachment-id=\"89296\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/the-year-of-the-musical-biopic/bohemian-rhapsody/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"bohemian rhapsody\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89296\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bohemian-rhapsody.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89296\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of 20th Century Fox.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bohemian Rhapsody,” of the “big three” musical films of the past year, fell the hardest into the trap of cheap storytelling.

Most musical biopics attempt a pitch perfect recreation of songs, often using recordings from the original artists and every sound mixing technique. The goal is for the difference to be unrecognizable. “Rocketman” took liberties with speed and sound of the songs to fit what the John’s character was feeling in a particular scene. The songs are more thematic than chronological of his career. “The Bitch is Back,” one of John’s later pieces, is sung early in the film during John’s childhood. Conversely, “I’m Still Standing” was recorded before John went to rehab in 1990, yet the film uses the piece for John’s triumphant recovery.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These little nuances in song choice are a way the music is used to elevate the story instead of simply marking a scene. But overall, “Rocketman”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">simplifies the larger than life narrative of Elton John. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What many in Hollywood fail to see is the multitude of ways to pay homage to musical artists besides the biopic. “Yesterday,” currently playing in theaters, is turning a new tide in the current musical biopic renaissance. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_89298\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1781412502\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"89288\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-89298\" data-attachment-id=\"89298\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-10/the-year-of-the-musical-biopic/yesterday/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?fit=1000%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,550\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"yesterday\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?fit=888%2C488&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-89298\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?resize=888%2C488\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?resize=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yesterday.jpg?resize=768%2C422&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-89298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Universal Pictures.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yesterday”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tells a deeper and richer story that ultimately pays more respect to the Beatles by staying further from the Fab Four themselves and focusing on the music more than anything. Jack Malik awakens after an accident and realizes that he is the only person on Earth who remembers the Beatles, recreating their songs to become famous himself. The film is able to explore deeper themes of music preservation and the negative sides to the music industry through Jack’s rise to fame, rather than retelling the familiar story of how John, George, Paul and Ringo were all torn apart by it. The story behind many Beatles songs are so familiar that there’s no originality to explaining why John Lennon wrote “Help!” for example, but watching Jack’s cry for help near the end of the movie through that song in particular provides a fresh perspective to the song.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Yesterday,” in many places, still feels like a musical biopic because of how close Jack’s rise to power was to the Beatles. But by telling an original story in a universe without the Beatles, the film can show us exactly what the band had to sacrifice for their fame. Near the end of the film, as Jack is in the middle of a crisis about taking credit for the Beatles’ music, he gets to meet John Lennon, who without the Beatles is living peacefully in the countryside and has lived a long life of success – not through fame, but of happiness and love. This scene shows us from a different perspective just how much the Beatles, and Jack Malik, sacrificed for their stardom. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original storyline of “Yesterday” got right what so many musical biopics get wrong, but in no way is it a perfect film. It still limits itself to the same old formula of the three-act rise, fall and rise again of the star. It just so happens that star is a new character instead of the original artist. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it that other film genres become more daring and innovative year by year, while the musical biopic seems to be frozen in time? Perhaps maybe I am too harsh to expect more from the musical biopic than what they give time and time again. The summer blockbuster, for better and worse, is mainly a market for mainstream fun flicks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Freddie Mercury, Elton John and the Beatles shared was widespread popularity through constantly innovating and breaking new ground. What these films share today is the tendency to play it safe.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2105.jpg?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/katherine-swartz/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Katherine Swartz</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Katherine Swartz is the University News Editor for the 2020-2021 school year.

About 92% of the building’s total space will be devoted to classrooms and lecture halls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Finance and Capital Strategies Committee is comprised of UC Regents as well as other advisory members, including Governor Gavin Newsom, UC President Janet Napolitano and chancellors from some of the UC campuses. They approved UCSB’s new building </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> along with new building projects at the Riverside, Berkeley and San Diego campuses </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on May 16 at the UC Regents meeting at UC San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new building projects are part of <a href=\"https://www.facilities.ucsb.edu/departments/campus-planning-design/2010-long-range-development-plan-lrdp\">UC’s Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)</a>; the plan was implemented by the Regents in 2010, with the purpose of “shap[ing] how the campus will develop to the year 2025, including changes in our academic programs and the development of additional campus housing for students, faculty, and staff,” according to UCSB’s Design, Facilities, and Safety Services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, UCSB’s new Classroom Building will cost $97,133,000; 82% of funding is from state appropriations of $79,787,000, while 18% is from campus funds, which are non-state, non-tuition reserves from grants, investments and sponsored contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A portion of state appropriations will also come from state funding previously allocated for the Campbell Hall Replacement Building. Originally, the funding was allocated to tear down and replace Campbell Hall; however, concerns of the project’s financial feasibility, combined with immediate safety concerns, led UCSB to implement critical life-safety improvements and repairs in order to ensure safe, ongoing use of Campbell Hall, according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposal states the new building will also alleviate problems of over-enrollment which have contributed to lower four-year graduation rates. UCSB’s registrar cited “lack of classrooms and inappropriately sized classrooms as the primary cause of … increasing student waitlists that tend to affect the four-year graduation rate.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new Classroom Building will accommodate more than “twice the capacity and many more rooms than the previous Campbell Hall plans,” according to the proposal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other alternatives to the Classroom Building discussed in the proposal include leasing off-campus space or annexing existing academic and administrative building space, but these ideas were not deemed viable by the committee because all other existing facilities on campus are already fully occupied, and “logistical problems” prevented leasing buildings in Isla Vista for classroom use.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_88801\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-88801\" data-attachment-id=\"88801\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/regents-approve-new-classroom-building-to-alleviate-over-enrollment/screen-shot-2019-05-29-at-3-32-34-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=1200%2C772&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,772\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-29 at 3.32.34 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?fit=888%2C571&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-88801 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=888%2C571\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.32.34-PM.png?resize=1024%2C659&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-88801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Proposed design for the new Classroom Building, located between the Psychology building and Davidson Library. <em>Courtesy of UC Regents</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to substantially increasing the amount of classroom space on campus, the Classroom Building will also incorporate more modern classroom designs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current classrooms are “exclusively traditional in format … lack[ing] the flexibility, amenities, and technology needed to accommodate contemporary, project-based learning,” according to the proposal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three active learning classrooms in the Classroom Building are designed for project-based teaching and group and student participation, with flexibility to arrange furniture and digital and visual technology for each class’s specific needs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional discussion classrooms will include moveable furnishings and digital capability for project-based work, and lecture halls will be designed with rotating seats, allowing “turn-to-team” interaction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Classroom Building plan also requires the demolishing of Building 408, which holds the </span>McCauley Lab in EEMB (Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology) and the Passow Lab in MSI (Marine Science Institute), along with various graduate and faculty offices.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus bike path runs through the future construction site for the Classroom Building;

He will enter college in fall 2019 with the class of 2023. <em>Riley Esguerra / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on Feb. 14, 2018 in Parkland, Fla., Hogg has been in the national spotlight for the past year as a vocal advocate for gun control legislation and voter registration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hogg’s talk is part of a greater conversation on campus this week around gun violence in light of the fifth anniversary of the Isla Vista shooting, something Hogg briefly referenced in the beginning of his speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m not going to do a moment of silence because, to be frank, I fucking hate moments of silence,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I feel like we always hear in Congress, our politicians go, ‘Let’s just not talk about this. Let’s be quiet’… if we go out and speak about how to actually stop shootings from happening, that’s being too political because it stops the people in Congress that make money off of gun violence.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hogg’s speech centered on his background as an activist over the past year after being thrust into the national conversation around gun violence. He also spoke on a variety of political issues during his speech, including mass incarceration, immigration and U.S. foreign policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Hogg, guns were always a part of his life; his father, an FBI agent, instilled in him a “respect” for gun ownership. He clarified to the audience that he is not anti-Second Amendment but feels the National Rifle Association (NRA) does not look out for gun owners like Hogg’s father. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s almost like they don’t actually care about anyone’s safety, not even people they claim to protect,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hogg spoke in unexpectedly candid detail about his experience during the Parkland shooting, describing the confusion of himself and his fellow classmates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everybody’s freaking out. There’s people having panic attacks. There is an incredible amount of dread. It’s dark because we don’t want [the] shooter to see us. Everybody’s trying to be quiet while also telling all their parents everything that they want to say before they die,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even when speaking about the shooting, Hogg’s message was highly political. As he waited in a classroom, unaware of the shooter’s location, he said he pulled out his camera and interviewed students to send a message of gun reform to national politicians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many of them talked about the NRA … so that if we did die, they couldn’t say that ‘talking about gun violence is standing on the bodies of dead children’ if those dead children want you to be talking about gun violence,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we died in that classroom, hopefully our voices would carry on and create some kind of change in a place that clearly fucking needs it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the same day of the shooting after Hogg was cleared to evacuate the school, he began talking to media outlets at the scene and organizing what would become March for Our Lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I needed to speak for those that couldn’t speak at the time … [I wanted] what happened at our school to create some change. I wanted our school [to] not just be another name on a list of schools that have gone through school shootings, but a name that people remember. Not something where people feel pity for the school or anything like that, but feel empowered and know that those kids did something,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hogg began to realize the greater power of the March for Our Lives movement when over a million people marched around the world on March 24, 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One thing I will always remember as well is the mirage of heat that came off the crowd in Washington DC, on a pretty relatively cold March day,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I knew that that was the heat that could create change, that was the heat that had fueled movements previously and that was the heat that was going to fuel this movement as well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step for the March for Our Lives movement was Road to Change, a cross-country bus trip to speak with other activists and register young people to vote. The trip was inspired by the Freedom Riders of the civil rights movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What Parkland went through as a predominantly white community… we understood that we didn’t live through everyday acts of gun violence. If we actually do want to work [on] significantly reducing gun violence … we had to work with every community and not speak for anybody else and bring people on the bus with us from around the country,” Hogg said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When speaking with gun reform activists in East Oakland, Hogg realized the normalcy of gun violence in other communities when a shooting happened a few blocks away during the meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I hear a pop, and I looked at them, and they’re like, ‘Oh, that was a car backfiring,’ and then we hear several more, and it was a shooting right next to us at the same time. That doesn’t make it on the news because it’s not a mass shooting and doesn’t get treated nearly the same way, which is wrong and shouldn’t happen,” Hogg said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Road to Change, Hogg also encountered people across the country who are against gun control legislation and challenged the notion that gun ownership equates to freedom during his speech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is freedom if we’re dead? What is freedom if we can’t fucking survive high school because we get shot either on our way to school or we get shot in our classroom, [which is] supposed to be the safest place in America for every young person to learn and thrive? What is freedom if we were constantly going out there, and we don’t actually have our votes count because we are continuously disenfranchised?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back on his work in the past year as a leader of March for Our Lives, Hogg focused on voter registration in the 2018 elections and legislative victories across the country. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By one year after the shooting … we had gotten 67 gun laws passed at the state level, we had gone to competitive congressional districts around the country and met amazing young people around the country that had experienced gun violence and [used] that trauma not as a dividing factor as the people in power want us to use it, but as a uniting factor to make sure that nobody else has to live through it ever again in any zip code, in any community.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youth voter turnout in the 2018 midterm election was the highest in modern American history at 38%, but this is only the beginning for Hogg, who is aiming for 71% youth voter turnout in 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First-year biology major Lisa Liu, who attended Hogg’s talk on Tuesday, said she has a personal connection to the March for Our Lives movement that drew her to the talk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was a senior in high school, that’s when the shooting happened at Parkland, and me and a few students put on a march for our own school,” Liu said. “I just wanted to learn more about his story because it impacted our community, and I’m from Thousand Oaks, so there’s currently a history of gun violence,” referencing the recent Borderline Bar &amp; Grill shooting in Thousand Oaks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of his talk, Hogg challenged the audience to take his story and create political change in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What I ask is when you leave this room, go and talk to your friends about registering to vote. Go and bring your friends to the polls. Go out there and vote for morally just leaders that care about young people and whether or not we make it through the school day and whether or not we survive in our own communities; whether or not we have to think on a daily basis of whether or not we’re going to live or die, because that is not what freedom looks like,” Hogg said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If this conversation dies in this room, I have failed.”</span></p>\n<p><i>[Editor’s Note]: Before speaking to UC Santa Barbara in Campbell Hall, Hogg sat down with </i>Daily Nexus<i> Asst.
