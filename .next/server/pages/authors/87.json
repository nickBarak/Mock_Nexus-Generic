already been before several district courts, two circuit courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court on two occasions.”</p>\n<p>According to Bates, neither the DHS’s legal reasoning nor its assessment of litigation risk was adequate enough to support its rescindment of DACA.</p>\n<p>The order will not go into effect until 90 days from now, giving DHS the opportunity to “better explain its rescission decision.” If the department fails to do so, it “must accept and process new as well as renewal DACA applications,” Bates said in his decision.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President specified they will not only continue to fight for DACA in the courts, but they will also urge Congress to pass legislation “that will provide permanent statutory protection for DACA.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this

platforms during a forum on Monday. <em>Lianna Nakashima/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>With campaigning for Associated Students elections underway, candidates for A.S. Senate extended their platforms Monday at The Hub, pointing to their own experiences and calling for unity between the oft-divided campus parties.</p>\n<p>Students can vote for A.S. elected officials starting April 23. Official slates for the 2018-19 A.S. Senate can be found here.</p>\n<p>For the most part, candidates for both Campus United (CU) and the Isla Vista Party (IVP) converged on issues at the official forum, agreeing on topics like safety in I.V., keeping tuition and student fees at a minimum and voting for Measure R, which would fund the I.V. Community Services District.</p>\n<p>There were few points of tension, but the candidates did take different approaches when it came to discussing a fee initiative that would fund a controversial University Center renovation. While IVP candidates criticized the project’s proposed use of student fees, CU’s batch of A.S. hopefuls said students themselves should be the main deciders of whether the plan is best for them.</p>\n<p>Monday’s questions, written by both A.S. Elections Board and submitted anonymously by audience members during the forum, included topics about I.V. safety, the proposed NewCen project, I.V. governance and other off-campus issues.</p>\n<p>Candidates’ responses to these questions and overarching goals are summarized below:</p>\n<p>Ashley Ng, an IVP candidate, said equipping Community Service Officers with official school vehicles would be a good way to ensure safety for I.V. residents. To CU candidate Sydney Karmes-Wainer, an off-campus CU candidate, the most important changes needed are the most visible and tangible ones, which she said take shape in facilities that need better upkeep.</p>\n<p>CU’s Amy Zhou said redrawing inefficient parking lines would be first on her agenda, while her partymate Mordi Shadpour said his main goal was making the area “very safe for everyone and welcoming to students from all walks of life.” He cited his work with UC Santa Barbara Life of the Party in promoting safer alcohol and drug use in I.V.</p>\n<p>Salvadore Hernandez Arellano of IVP noted that ramping up the use of blue lighting and decreasing police presence in I.V. would help make the community safer.</p>\n<p>CU’s Adam Chohan didn’t mention a specific action, but rather said his first line of action would be to talk to the people he’d be working to represent.</p>\n<p>Jasmine Palmerin of IVP said her main focus is to create a safer I.V. by lighting up dimmer areas and installing emergency blue lights throughout I.V. that have call buttons to contact local law enforcement. With her experience as a volunteer for the Women’s Center, she believes sexual assault hasn’t been acknowledged in I.V. and is something she will focus on as senator.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Christian Ornelas said he wants to work toward addressing the mold problem in I.V. housing. He said he will work toward getting units better ventilation by talking to landlords and opening up tenant-to-landlord communication. Ornelas supports Measure R, which would fund the CSD, in order to address tenant and landlord mediation.</p>\n<p>Dallin Mello of IVP said he will create a commission that bridges connections for student workers and the City of Santa Barbara. Mello said student workers have different needs than most students, and he hopes to build opportunities for them. In response to a question about differences in political beliefs, Mello said, “just because we don’t see eye to eye, doesn’t mean we can’t work together.”</p>\n<p>CU’s Nicole Estess hopes to work with the CSD and I.V. Foot Patrol to integrate more lighting in I.V. and work as a mediator with local law enforcement. Estess currently works in with the EVPSA office lobbying for UC funding.</p>\n<p>Alexander “Alex” Young of CU, said he will focus on I.V. and UCSB sustainability as well as opening up communication with his constituents. He said he is also in support of Measure R to fund the CSD. In response to his support for the NewCen project, Young said, “it’s up to the student themselves if their fees should be used for the UCen.”</p>\n<p>CU’s Andrew Nguyen said that creating online forums for A.S. committees will build communication between A.S. and the student body. In response to the question about the NewCen project, Nguyen said he sees that “it might be a long-term investment.”</p>\n<p>Yara Khamis of CU will strive to open up more means of communication to build “a stronger community,” especially between permanent residents of I.V. and students. She wants to improve the way sexual assault is addressed in I.V. and is a supporter of Measure R.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Ryan Clark said he wants to make Gaucho Care more inclusive and help improve the quality of parks in I.V. Clark wants to work toward making sure that sexual assault cases reach the appropriate authorities and have more students involved in community based policing.</p>\n<p>Jalia “Jolly” Carlton-Carew of IVP said she will strive to create a web-series show about Isla Vista “to craft our own narrative to tell our own story.” She believes the NewCen should not come from student fees, but that the university should allocate that funding and “we shouldn’t have to pay for things that we should already be provided.”</p>\n<p>Carla Cernat of CU wants to create more community based policing and implement restorative justice-based programs for students. She hopes to extend C.A.R.E. workshops and sexual assault training to all students, not just fraternities and sororities. Cernat also wants to increase safety in I.V. and believes she has done so already in helping create the Sun Fest, an alternative Deltopia activity for students.</p>\n<p>CU’s Zachary Zeising, sustainability chair of his fraternity, said he wants to push for safety and environmentally friendly systems in I.V. He specifically wants to install an emergency blue light system in I.V. to help create faster responses to sexual assault incidents.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

class=\"wp-caption-text\">As previously <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/historic-el-centro-building-set-to-reopen/\">reported</a> in Jan. 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day eviction notice for the demolition of the building due to structural issues, including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.<em> Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Last Saturday — after nearly a year of fighting against the demolition of the building — students, community members and UCSB staff and faculty came together for the reopening of the renovated El Centro Arnulfo Casillas building.</p>\n<p>The open house celebration started with a ceremonial song and blessing by Chumash elder Marcus Lopez.</p>\n<p>“This center is to celebrate the new vision of the world that we are going to live in,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>He said the reopening shows that “tradition can break the master narrative” of historical colonial power over people of color and that the students, community and everyone involved in El Centro will redefine what the new narrative is.</p>\n<p>“I’m happy to see and to be here and to give you that message through these ancient songs,” Lopez said.</p>\n<p>In commemorating the students for their work in saving El Centro, Lopez said “this is your strong hold, make it wise, make your connections with what you need to connect.”</p>\n<p>As previously <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/historic-el-centro-building-set-to-reopen/\">reported</a> in Jan. 2017, occupants of the building received a 45-day eviction notice for the demolition of the building due to structural issues, including insect infestation, poor ventilation and structural damage that made the building highly unstable in the event of an earthquake.</p>\n<p>After the eviction notice, students and alumni voiced their frustration toward the administration and continually fought for the permanency and improvement of the building, according to Shahryar Mooraj, a member of the El Centro committee and fourth-year mathematical science and physics double major.</p>\n<p>“As students, we came together to stop that and to fight for the history and the culture that has been built in that space over time and to ensure that El Centro has a permanent physical space on campus,” Mooraj said.</p>\n<p>“Keeping the doors open for those yet to come,” is written on the sign hanging over the front door entrance.</p>\n<p>The reopening ceremony commemorated past and present students and faculty that have fought for the fruition and continuation of El Centro through decades of social justice work, community resistance and grassroots organizing so future students of color can feel they

they were served the eviction which “essentially condemned” and made “immediate evacuation” necessary on Jan. 9, 2017, feels like “decades ago [rather] than just last year.” But it was last year when we as students were told that the temporary building 406 was essentially condemned and our immediate evacuation was necessary,” Adame said.</p>\n<p>According to Adame, they were asked to “remove the art, the decades of posters, murals and designs” that mark student protests and struggles that were born and grew out of El Centro, but they were also asked to abandon “the safety [they] had created within these four walls.”</p>\n<p>Adame said that the students El Centro carry with them, the Chicanx movement of MEChA, the hunger strikes of 1988 and 1994, and more movements uplifted them.</p>\n<p>Congressman and UCSB alumnus Salud Carbajal and Chancellor Henry T. Yang were present at the ceremony along with Ozzie Vargas, director of the Educational Opportunity Program and representatives from Counseling and Psychological Services. Many Chicano/a studies department faculty and Associated Students (A.S.) officials were also present.</p>\n<p>Event organizer, Yaneli Gutierrez, distinguished A.S. executive director, Marisela Marquez as a staff member that has been a supporter of El Centro since her time as a graduate student on campus.</p>\n<p>Marquez told the story of the day she first visited El Centro in 1988. She said “it was the first time I had exhaled in three years.”</p>\n<p>“In the early years, I watched [students] negotiate and sell M&amp;M’s to actually create the first La Raza college day,” Marquez said, referring to when El Congreso, one of El Centro’s organizations, brings high school and middle school students of color to campus to introduce them to how higher education works.</p>\n<p>Marquez said the Chicanx and Latinx student population has gone from approximately 12 percent to over 25 percent and credited El Centro as a main reason for UCSB’s effectiveness as a Hispanic Serving Institution.</p>\n<p>Marquez emphasized that past and present generations of students have created a space where future students will retain what El Centro has to offer.</p>\n<p>“Without [the students’ work] we wouldn’t be standing here. Its known that the next generation of students are right behind you and they’re taking it to heart,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the April 19 print edition

recital and art exhibition on Thursday. <em>Courtesy of Osiris Gómez </em></p></div>\n<p>For the first time at UC Santa Barbara, indigenous writers, poets and scholars gathered for “A Verbal Kaleidoscope,” a conference aiming to challenge how indigenous literature and practices are studied in Western academia by presenting modern-day indigenous literary movements.</p>\n<p>Throughout eight sessions across two days, the Spanish and Portuguese department brought together Juan Gregorio Regino, director of Mexico’s National Institute of Indigenous Languages, native Zapotec and Mazatec writers and local community members to discuss contemporary and ancestral indigenous peoples’ literary perspectives.</p>\n<p>The conference, which ran through April 4 and 5, started with a singing ceremony by local Chumash tribal members acknowledging and respecting the tribe’s history and life in their land in the nearby area.</p>\n<p>A majority of the discussions were held in Spanish and the poetry recital held at the Art, Design and Architecture Museum was translated from the native languages such as Irma Pineda Santiago’s poems in Zapotec.</p>\n<p>“We were very surprised by the caliber of the presentations,” Osiris Gómez, Ph.D. candidate in Hispanic Literature and conference organizer said.</p>\n<p>Gómez previously said organizers wanted to break traditional conference dynamics by creating a more fluid conversation and feels they were able to accomplish that goal, but believes there is still room to grow when exploring indigenous literature in academia.</p>\n<p>“It was an amazing experience to be able to bring together writers and scholars in this level, especially people from all over the country and abroad,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>Gómez was impressed with the speakers’ keynote presentations and said they opened up the conversation for other speakers to participate and break out of the one-way conversation that presentations often create.</p>\n<p>He appreciated the speakers’ creativity in using their own literary work for their responses, such as when Juan Gregorio Regino started reading from his poetry to answer the questions from the moderator.</p>\n<p>“That’s when we really went into the poetic act to explore [the conversation],” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>At a later panel during the conference, Regino spoke about “revolutionizing modern literature,” claiming that what indigenous scholars are doing with their work is of the most contemporary literature in the world today.</p>\n<p>“La poesía lingüísticamente es una reconstrucción de la propia lengua,” Regino said, meaning “poetry linguistically reconstructs language.”</p>\n<p>He continued by saying that creating poetry with native languages indigenous people can get them involved in the world of creating literature.</p>\n<p>Another element of poetry that Regino finds useful for indigenous people is “la afirmación de decir ‘aquí estamos, aqui esta nuestras lenguas, aquí están nuestras escrituras y estamos vivos,’” Regino said, meaning “the affirmation in saying ‘we are here, here are our tongues, here is our literature and we are alive.”</p>\n<p>Regino said the indigenous literary movement is in a transition and that the conference itself has explored ways to see from the outside how the movement is progressing.</p>\n<p>The movement “tiene que transcender el mundo indígena, y solamente así es como cambiamos y vamos a sentir entendidos. Solamente así este movimiento va tener presencia y fuerza,” Regino said, meaning “[the movement] has to transcend outside of the indigenous world and only then will we feel understood and have presence and strength.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82342\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82342\" data-attachment-id=\"82342\"

professor, spoke during the first session titled “Beyond Aztlan: New Nahua Perspectives.” Her talk, “Throwing Shade to the West,” presented a Xicana indigena point of view within literature and academia.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Moraga pointed out the long history of colonization of indigenous people and how traditional language departments were “generated from a very eurocentric perspective.”</p>\n<p>Moraga applauded the Spanish department for hosting a conference on subjects typically only covered in the field of anthropology.</p>\n<p>“To think that a Spanish department was actually hosting a conference on indigenous languages is an incredible breakthrough,” Moraga said.</p>\n<p>“[The conference] speaks to this evolution of consciousness beginning to happen even among sites that traditionally held indigenous thinking and people in disregard,” Moraga said.</p>\n<p>Moraga was particularly impressed with the Chumash women who spoke about recovering their own languages through working with non-indigenous anthropologists who have done research and have access to the languages.</p>\n<p>She said she admired them because “having to learn it through them, but then having to make it their own again,” is a challenge.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82341\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img

Cabranes-Grant, chair of the Spanish and Portuguese department, asked “Qué tipo de conocimiento nos ofrece la poesía y qué instrumento epistemológico es la poesía?” meaning “What knowledge does poetry offer us and what epistemological instruments does it have?”</p>\n<p>Zapotec poet Irma Pineda Santiago responded by saying that poetry has a broad social function beyond communication and the various genres of the ancestral Zapotec language can particularly allow poetry to go beyond its traditional elements.</p>\n<p>“People were speaking from their creative process and to me, that was amazing, you can only get that type of conversation when you interview an author,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>In the future, Gómez said, if a second version of the conference is possible, they will grow from this one and come up with new conference dynamics. “I think this conference was a great step in bringing a different type of conversation,” he said.</p>\n<p>Gómez noted that in bringing these poets to the conference, one can assume that they are representatives and can speak for their whole community or nation, but Gómez said they were very humble when presenting themselves.</p>\n<p>“They told us ‘this is what I do and this is how I represent my community,’ It was far more nourishing than just having a set of questions and their keynote address,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>“The intent of this conference is to create consciousness and not just about the political aspects of the literature, but I want it to become an invitation for people to actually become acquainted and curious,” Gómez said.</p><div

Azulejos, Mexico City. <em>Courtesy of Osiris Gómez</em></p></div>\n<p>In an interview with the Nexus, Gómez said he hopes the event will challenge traditional conference dynamics of “subject and observer.”</p>\n<p>Gómez said he hopes to break these boundaries by removing the limitations of a traditional conference by creating a bridge between western academia to alternative cultural knowledge.</p>\n<p>He said this can reshape the assumptions of oral indigenous traditions and the way literary scholars currently perceive collective knowledge and oral histories.</p>\n<p>According to Gómez, transcending traditional conference settings will connect western academia to the non-academic work that indigenous people do in everyday sacred practices.</p>\n<p>A year after sending out a “Call for Papers,” which invited indigenous and native scholars to submit literary work and art to be shared at the conference, Gómez hoped to catch the attention of community leaders, artists and activists from different universities both here and abroad.</p>\n<p>He now hopes the conference will explore how minority cultures are “revising their knowledges and epistemological sources through poetic art.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, Gómez conducted research in Mexico for a dissertation about native languages and the sociopolitical movements for their revival.</p>\n<p>After meditating on his research results, Gómez said he realized this was the start of conceptualizing this first indigenous writers conference.</p>\n<p>“Quiero crear conciencia,” Gómez said, meaning “I want to create consciousness.” Gomez hopes to create a “conscious dialogue” that places value in each authors’ respective native cultures and languages.</p>\n<p>The conference will also challenge the terminology surrounding indigenous cultures, including the word “indigenous” itself, when analyzed and studied within western academia.</p>\n<p>“It’s important to include people that live what we’re trying to understand here… We’re here to learn from everyone and to learn from experience,” Gómez said.</p>\n<p>According to the conference’s mission statement, Verbal Kaleidoscope will explore the resistance that “lies in the throats of these literary voices that proclaim cultural self-determination.”</p>\n<p>These literary voices “will echo a worldwide literary and social movement” that is fighting for the survival of indigenous territories and peoples.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

id=\"caption-attachment-81854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sartuche said that the I.V. census tract is currently exceeding allowances, but that will not prevent the department from issuing a new alcohol license. <em>Harrison Feerst/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>I.V. business owners hang in the balance on the issue, as many believe having an alcohol license can be vital for a successful restaurant in I.V., while others believe it doesn’t make any difference at all.</p>\n<p>There are currently 14 active onsite alcohol licenses in I.V., but only 11 on-site licenses are allowed, according to Nick Sartuche, the supervising agent of the Alcohol Beverage Control Department (ABC) for the Ventura District Office.</p>\n<p>There are also six active offsite alcohol licenses, but only five are allowed for the I.V. census tract.</p>\n<p>Offsite licenses include liquor store sales where consumption occurs off the site of the business, such as Keg-n-Bottle and SOS Liquor.</p>\n<p>According to Sartuche, local officials use the I.V. census tract to determine if new licenses will be issued based off the population and existing licenses in the area.</p>\n<p>The census tract is a small mapped geographical location, usually a subdivision of a county.</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista is a location that is looked at more closely,” Sartuche said. “Because of the high concentration of college students in Isla Vista, it is a factor that is taken into consideration.”</p>\n<p>For the past 13 years, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and the ABC department have been “very cautious” with additional alcohol licensing applications in I.V., said Gina Fischer, spokesperson for Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann’s office.</p>\n<p>Local entities such as the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office, the planning department and other local officials give input to the ABC department when determining the offsite alcohol licensing allowances in I.V.</p>\n<p>The ABC department overlooks the allowances for on-site sales of alcohol at restaurants and bars by investigating the business’s finances and location.</p>\n<p>Sartuche said that the I.V. census tract is currently exceeding allowances, but that will not prevent the department from issuing a new license.</p>\n<p>“We can still issue a license even if it’s over-concentrated, but we look at that during the application process and determine if there is a public convenience or necessity to exceed the allowable number,” Sartuche said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Fischer, the Third District Supervisor’s Office believes “alcohol consumption is in oversupply in Isla Vista, [and] no new licenses for on-site consumption or off-site sales have been issued during this time.”</span></p>\n<p>“A couple of Isla Vista stakeholders have engaged in conversations aiming to change the status quo with the belief that if more I.V. businesses could serve beer and wine onsite, that would improve the quality of life in I.V. and improve the bottom line for restaurants,” Fischer said.</p>\n<p>Former 25-year restaurateur and 40-year Isla Vista resident Rodney Gould said that having an alcohol license is an important revenue source for many restaurants, but not all.</p>\n<p>“To me, it is simply an unfair business practice, especially in situations where your competitor down the block has the ability to serve beer and wine and you do not,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>Gould says that acquiring an alcohol license is not the only obstacle for many owners; even after acquiring a license, some licenses limit the hours that businesses are allowed to sell alcohol.</p>\n<p>Ben Quagliani, shift manager at Pizza My Heart, told the <em>Nexus</em> that the restaurant acquired their alcohol license about six years ago when the restaurant first opened and it has been an important contribution to their sales.</p>\n<p>“To be honest, if we didn’t have beer, our business would not be doing very well or surviving at all in Isla Vista because the majority of our sales do come from beer. I mean, this is a sports bar above anything else at this point,” Quagliani said.</p>\n<p>According to Frankie Somayoni, general manager and owner of Sam’s to Go in I.V., the sandwich shop has been serving draft beer since the 1980s.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely a part of our sales, but if you were to take the beer license away we shouldn’t have that much of a drop in sales,” Somayoni said.</p>\n<p>According to Somayoni, Sam’s to Go which has three other locations throughout the county, would be interested in expanding their alcohol license, “but given the situation right now, I.V. is not issuing any more licenses. It’s really hard to add on — whatever it is, wine or hard alcohol.”</p>\n<p>Other I.V. restaurants like Hana Kitchen, Rosarito’s and Pho Bistro told the <em>Nexus </em>they do not feel the need to acquire an alcohol license because their sales are doing fine without it.</p>\n<p>Hartmann’s office is currently asking for concerned stakeholders to do further research on the issue of alcohol licensing and present creative solutions to change the culture of over consumption of alcohol in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>In efforts to improve public safety, Fischer said in an email that the district office is trying to  “compel” businesses to voluntarily switch from off-site to on-site consumption licensure, looking to secure more grants for “effective compliance operations and provide more server training to prevent “over-serving.”</p>\n<p>Gould believes that a “healthy, thriving downtown business district” in I.V. that could stay open late to compete with businesses in Santa Barbara and Goleta could provide entertainment and may eliminate some of the need for people to party in the residential areas of I.V. since “the majority of alcohol-related crime occurs in the residential areas.”</p>\n<p><em>Anyi Cheng and Ruth Sanchez contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

to bypass the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the second level of the federal court process, by having the Supreme Court review an order made in January.</p>\n<p>The January court order by Federal Judge William Alsup, which temporarily blocked Trump’s attempt to end DACA, also involved the UC’s lawsuit against the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in September, claiming the repeal of DACA violated the rights of people who benefit from the program.</p>\n<p>The UC announced in a statement on Monday that they are pleased the Supreme Court has denied the government’s appeal.</p>\n<p>“Now that the administration’s extraordinary maneuver has been rightfully rejected, we look forward to defending U.S. District Judge Alsup’s injunction in the Court of Appeals,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez in Calif. ruled on Monday that Trump cannot rescind DACA protection without giving its recipients notice in order to legally defend themselves. This allows the Obama-era program more time to protect young undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>Gutierrez’s preliminary injunction states that the administration cannot take away recipients’ individual protection under DACA.</p>\n<p>After declining Trump’s request, the Department of Homeland Security will continue to accept DACA renewal applications for existing recipients, while the DACA court case will continue through the regular federal court processes.</p>\n<p>Trump announced in September that he would end DACA by March 5. With less than a week to go until that date, Monday’s ruling is seen as a win for the nearly 700,000 young immigrants that are protected from deportation under DACA.</p>\n<p>March 5 was seen as a deadline for Congress to take bipartisan action on immigration reform, which resulted in a three-day government shutdown last month. That deadline is now void, since the ruling gives Congress more time to make a decision on a long-term bill.</p>\n<p>The court process is expected to take months, which may allow Congress time to pass a long-term spending bill for DACA and immigration reform. However, it may also delay action due to a lack of urgency, since the federal court process will likely pick up in October during the Supreme Court’s new term.</p>\n<p>Monday’s ruling is the third time a lower court has ruled against Trump’s rescindment of DACA, which essentially deems his efforts illegal and allows the program to continue past March 5.</p>\n<p>The first was in January, an action Trump attempted to appeal on Monday. It allowed recipients to continue renewing their work permits and DACA status.</p>\n<p>The second attempt on Feb. 13 stated that the terms by which the Trump administration ended DACA were unaccountable and arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Both rulings allowed only current DACA recipients to renew their status, but do not allow those who never applied before the rescindment to apply for the program.</p>\n<p>Monday’s ruling once again blocks Trump’s attempts to end DACA, but focuses more on individual protection rather than work permit status renewal.</p>\n<p>The UC said in their statement Monday that it was “inappropriate for the Trump administration to short circuit standard appellate procedure and attempt to skip the U.S. Court of Appeals.”</p>\n<p>They claim it was “a precipitous approach that echoes the government’s procedurally improper rescission of DACA at the heart of this case.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the March 1, 2018 issue

part of a series of 12 demands that would increase comunity safety regarding sexual assault. The center would provide legal assistance for survivors of sexual assault and would recieve support from A.S. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The demand calls for a survivor resource center that will “lead programming efforts to spread awareness among the student body and throughout the off campus Isla Vista community.”</p>\n<p>The center will also require a full-time director and staff, as well as legal service for sexual assault survivors.</p>\n<p>Students at the Tuesday’s meeting asked that the center be effective for underrepresented communities, which they said should help in creating and managing the center.</p>\n<p>The university requested $56,000 to secure the help of the Alliance for HOPE, a nonprofit agency that develops family justice centers to protect and heal sexual assault survivors and their families.</p>\n<p>The university submitted the funding request in December, but the status will not be known until “spring time” of this year, said C.A.R.E. Director Briana Conway during the meeting.</p>\n<p>An additional assessment proposal provides a “blueprint” for all constituents involved in planning the creation of a survivor resource center, Conway added.</p>\n<p>Students expressed concern that collaborating with outside entities might not be effective in authentically representing the marginalized communities that the center aims to support.</p>\n<p>Third-year communications major Jasmine Lee said a more concrete timeline of the two-year assessment proposal and the university funding request status would help student organizers search for alternate sources of funding.</p>\n<p>She said the university needs to communicate with students about the financing process so they can take action as the funding comes through.</p>\n<p>Katya Armistead, Dean of Student Life, said during the meeting that it can be “helpful to bring in an outsider to facilitate” the creation of the center.</p>\n<p>Armistead also said the university must apply for grants in order to build the center. But the university already has other grants lined up, which might delay the approval of a grant for the center, she said.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major Justice Dumlao requested that the center be part of the Associated Students Boards, Commissions and Units so the center can work closely and partner with student organizations and campus departments.</p>\n<p>“This is not going to be C.A.R.E. out in I.V.,” Conway said, referring to the Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education program. “This is a separate, distinct resource.” Conway also explained that the center will be its own entity, independent from existing UCSB sexual assault survivor resources.</p>\n<p>C.A.R.E. will still be a “strong partner” moving forward with the center, Conway added.</p>\n<p>“This needs to be bigger than just C.A.R.E.,” she said.</p>\n<p>There will be a follow-up meeting to further discuss the demand on March 6 at the Student Resource Building.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared

there was a 50 percent increase in attendance for weekly Students for Recovery 12-step open meetings, according to Angie Bryan, the GFR Recovery Program Manager.</p>\n<p>In response, GFR ​announced three new support groups for students and community members recovering from addiction. The new S.M.A.R.T. Recovery meeting and Graduate/Non-Traditional Student 12-step meeting diversify the organization’s approach, allowing for students with different paths and a more cognitive method of addressing addiction.</p>\n<p>GFR also began hosting an Alanon meeting for family members and loved ones affected by people with substance use disorders, who are either working or not working toward recovery.</p>\n<p>Bryan founded GFR in the fall of 2012 after working in the UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program as a marriage and family therapist.</p>\n<p>After researching other campus-based collegiate recovery programs, Bryan found a similar program at Texas Tech University, which provided grants through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for replication programs on other campuses.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been in long-term recovery for 13 years so this is something that I was really interested in,” Bryan said. “So [SAMHSA] paid for me to go out there and see their program and see how we might start it here.”</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Behavioral Wellness Department agreed to contribute start-up funding for GFR after Bryan met someone within the department who “happened to be in long-term recovery also.”</p>\n<p>According to Bryan, UCSB is the only UC that has an Alcohol and Drug Program. The program has been around for nearly 10 years, which Bryan said shows that the university already recognizes that support is needed. She believes recovery fit naturally into the campus services.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been very lucky here because UCSB administration has always been really supportive of this program,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>“The 18-25 age group is the fastest growing number of people going for treatment for alcohol and drug abuse. So we’re seeing a lot more students coming to college already in recovery or students getting into recovery while in college,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>At the start of the program, there were less than 10 people in attendance, and now at least a few dozen show up for meetings, according to fourth-year physics major and peer-intern Noah Shachar.</p>\n<p>“So nationally it’s a huge trend that we’re seeing, which is why there’s over 100 schools across the country that have some form of collegiate recovery support,” Bryan said. “We’re definitely one of the leaders in the country in development and what we have to offer here in our program.”</p>\n<p>GFR also hosts “sober events” for students to get out of I.V., including two camping trips a year, as well as “unity events,” Shachar said.<br>\nThe camping trips are organized in Spring Quarter around Deltopia and in Fall Quarter around Halloween. Bryan said these trips provide students alternative spaces when Isla Vista “isn’t a recovery-friendly environment.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody is mandated to come to our program; it’s all people that want our support on a voluntary basis,” Bryan said.</p>\n<p>Advocacy work helps change campus culture and reduce the stigma that a person in recovery is a “stereotypical addict,” Shachar and Bryan agreed.</p>\n<p>“When we use the term ‘person in recovery’ it sounds like someone that is trying to make some changes and are goal-oriented toward recovery… Someone in recovery is constantly in recovery and constantly improving upon themselves,” Shachar said. “We’re here to show people that you can start doing that at any time, at any age, in any situation — if that’s what you want.”</p>\n<p>GFR just ended its last year in contract with the county Behavioral and Wellness department because of policy changes. It is uncertain where funding will come from next year. However, Bryan said she is not worried because of support from the university and acquired grants.</p>\n<p>“I’m trying to trust that things will happen because so far in developmental programs that’s just how things work,” Bryan said. “Right when we think something isn’t going to work, something always comes out of the work, and we go from there.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

The board will advise the Title IX office on how to implement Title IX policies and procedures. <em>Maura Fox / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The advisory board met for the first time on Monday in Oakland, and attendees discussed prevention education, communication and outreach on campuses and what these policies look like now on all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Selvidge, a materials engineering graduate student was present at the meeting, but Tanaka, a fourth-year philosophy and sociology double major, was unable to attend.</p>\n<p>The board will advise the Title IX office on how to implement Title IX policies and procedures and will have “less input” on legal interpretation of the federal statute, according to Salvaty.</p>\n<p>System-wide Title IX Coordinator Kathleen Salvaty told the <em>Nexus</em> that the<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\"> creation of the board</a> was proposed when she took office in Feb. 2017.</p>\n<p>“I know there’s been a lot going on at the UCSB campus, but what I want to make sure is that we have some sort of healthy and open line of communication to the people who actually control the policy, if it’s a system-wide policy issue,” Salvaty said.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Hieu Le, who was on the selection committee for the formation of the board, said the board looked for applicants who were actively working on sexual assault and sexual violence issues.</p>\n<p>“We were looking for candidates who … had the experience and also had the relationships already built in to be able to interface with these groups on the campus-based level and to be able to relay what our campus concerns are to the system wide efforts,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The board was asked to connect with their campus Title IX and Campus Advocacy, Resources &amp; Education (C.A.R.E.) offices prior to the meeting. They were also told to solicit feedback from students on direct Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>According to Selvidge, she has been the head graduate student for nowUCSB, which is a sexual violence organization that’s entirely student-run and independent of the university.</p>\n<p>Selvidge said she spent a lot of time working on increasing awareness of domestic violence and dating, an issue which especially affects graduate students, many of whom are in long-term relationships.</p>\n<p>While at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate student, Selvidge said she was assaulted by a student and also harassed by a professor.</p>\n<p>“S.T.E.M. has a lot of sexual harassment and sexual assault that sort of gets swept under the rug, in part because it’s such a heavily male-dominated field,” she added. “I would like to see the expansion of the definitions of sexual assault and sexual harassment and especially dating violence and domestic violence because they’re currently exclusively related to force or threat of force.”</p>\n<p>Selvidge also hopes the board can talk to campus faculty and get them to understand that the concept of statute of limitations is concerning, especially when the state of California does not legally have a statute of limitations for sexual assault.</p>\n<p>As a queer-identifying individual, Selvidge believes the queer community has higher barriers in relation to assault reporting similar to the undocumented community, who may not feel safe reporting to the police, as “there’s all these nuanced issues with different communities,” she said.</p>\n<p>Selvidge is optimistic about the future of the board.</p>\n<p>“I definitely think we’ll get something out of it,” she said. “How big, how broad-reaching, how many ‘somethings,’ I don’t know yet.”</p>\n<p>Tanaka said that as an undergraduate, she hopes the Student Advisory Board will be a way for other undergraduates who have concerns about how the Title IX Office handles cases feel comfortable approaching the board with their concerns and feel heard.</p>\n<p>“My freshman year, I had a friend who confided in me about an assault, and I really didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know how to help her,” Tanaka said. “I went and talked to some people at C.A.P.S. asking, ‘What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to help her?’”</p>\n<p>Tanaka went on to do training with the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center and worked as an advocate for their crisis hotline, directly advising survivors.</p>\n<p>Last Winter Quarter, Tanaka interned with C.A.R.E. through the Violence Intervention and Prevention Program.</p>\n<p>“We set up a campaign in I.V. to help educate people who worked at alcohol-serving establishments to spread the right kind of ways to intervene in a situation that could be potentially dangerous, as far as sexual violence goes because we figured a lot of the times out here, alcohol is involved,” Tanaka said.</p>\n<p>The advisory board will be meeting again in April and will be holding a series of phone calls in between regarding specific policy issues.</p>\n<p>“I think in terms of system-wide policy issues, students at UCSB should use their student advisory board representatives as a way to communicate those concerns,” Salvaty said. “If it’s a campus-specific issue, I hope they bring those up, too because I think it might be more helpful to raise issues at a system-wide level and see if we can solve it as a system.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Feb. 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80915\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80915\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-title-ix-student-advisory-board-selected-attends-first-meeting/","id":2324,"author":{"id":87,"name":"Stephany Rubio"},"related":[2323,2322,2321],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Naloxone Used in 9 Overdose Cases in SB County, 5 in I.V.

One incident resulted in a death and the second subject did not die, but also did not fully recover.</p>\n<p>SBSO worked with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and its Emergency Medical Services Agency last year to develop the Naloxone Program to combat the increasing number of overdoses in the county.</p>\n<p>Naloxone hydrochloride is the active ingredient in the prescription drug Narcan, a nasal spray that stops the effects of opioids, including extreme drowsiness, slowed breathing and loss of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Between 2011 and 2016, the Sheriff’s Coroner Unit observed a marked increase in overdose deaths. Opioids were present in approximately 65 percent of the overdose deaths that occurred in Santa Barbara County in 2016, according to the program press release.</p>\n<p>“Sheriff Brown, in conjunction with Dr. Gleghorn from SB County Behavioral Wellness recognized that opioid deaths were increasing throughout the country and that overall overdose deaths were increasing in SB County,” Bonner said in an email.</p>\n<p>SB County experienced 30 deaths due to all opioid-related overdoses in 2016, according to the most recent calendar year of data available.</p>\n<p>“At this point a number of initial first responder naloxone programs throughout the United States were showing significant promise in decreasing the number of people that die from opioid overdoses,” Bonner said.</p>\n<p>In October 2017, a 19-year-old male UC Santa Barbara student who was suffering from an apparent overdose in I.V. was administered naloxone and then transported to the hospital, the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/ucsb-student-hospitalized-after-apparent-overdose-police-administer-naloxone/\">reported</a>. Police found the student unconscious, but he survived the incident and woke up soon after the spray was administered.</p>\n<p>Police then administered naloxone to two other victims in I.V. in December, the <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-29/two-apparent-overdoses-in-isla-vista-within-24-hours-victims-receive-doses-of-naloxone/\">reported</a>. The first victim was a 23-year-old male and the second was a 20-year-old man. In both cases, the victims were found struggling to breathe before police administered naloxone.</p>\n<p>In 2015, there were 7.7 opioid overdose deaths per 100,000 residents in SB County and 193 incidents of 911-emergency calls where Narcan was administered by first responders.</p>\n<p>The number of 911-emergency calls where a first responder used Narcan increased in 2016 to 260.</p>\n<p>According to an SBSO press release about the Naloxone Program, sheriff patrol personnel were trained to know when to give Naloxone to block the effects of opioids.</p>\n<p>According to the Narcan <a href=\"https://www.narcan.com/faqs\">website</a>, naloxone reverses the effects of opioid overdose in two to three minutes, which gives the opioid-poisoned person time for emergency medical help to arrive.</p>\n<p>According to Michelle Wehmer, the SB County Public Health Department epidemiologist, Narcan can be administered for several reasons, including when a first responder sees a subject not breathing and decides to administer the drug, during an accidental drug overdose due to confusion of being on several medications and recreational narcotics use such as snorting and ingestion.</p>\n<p>The amount of training an agency or staff person has received can affect the likelihood of a responder to administer Narcan. Naloxone is only effective for opioid drug overdoses.</p>\n<p>First responders do not always know which drugs the patient might have ingested, which makes training more helpful for deputies who are now administering the drug on duty.</p>\n<p>According to the Narcan<a href=\"https://www.narcan.com/faqs\"> website</a>, the nasal spray should be administered immediately and does not take the place of emergency medical care.</p>\n<p>It is advised that emergency medical help is sought right away after giving the first dose of Narcan even if the person wakes up because they may relapse into breathing difficulty.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Feb. 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

government without coming to a resolution for the children of undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump formally ended DACA on Sept. 5, 2017 and expects to fully end the program by March 5.</p>\n<p>It is uncertain where DACA will leave its 800,000 recipients at a federal level, but California legislators and the University of California (UC) have stated they will continue to provide support for undocumented students.</p>\n<p>“If there’s a federal restriction, then there will be a restriction for federal resources for undocumented students in accessing them; however, for most resources they don’t need DACA to access, for example, The California Dream Act,” said Diana Valdivia, coordinator of Dream Scholars/Undocumented Students Services at UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Valdivia said the California Dream Act, which allows undocumented individuals who have AB 540 status to apply for financial aid at the state and institutional level, will not be affected by DACA ending. Educational aid in California will not be affected regardless of DACA status.</p>\n<p>The UC Immigrant Legal Services Center will continue to provide legal services to undocumented students with or without DACA, according to Valdivia.</p>\n<p>In 2013, the UC Office of the President allocated $5 million across the 10 UC campuses for undocumented student support and later earmarked $8.4 million a year through the 2018-19 academic year to be divided among the UC’s DREAM Loan Program, Undocumented Legal Services and targeted undergraduate and graduate fellowships.</p>\n<p>UC President Janet Napolitano also released a <a href=\"http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/UC-Community-DACA-FINAL.pdf\">statement</a> on Sept. 12, 2017, expressing support for undocumented students and prohibited UC campus police from contacting, detaining and arresting individuals based on suspected undocumented status.</p>\n<p>In September, Gov. Brown <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">signed</a> Senate Bill 54, which declared California a sanctuary state, prohibiting local and state law enforcement agencies from collaborating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal received local <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/no-daca-no-deal-dont-take-your-students-for-granted/\">backlash</a> on his decision to vote for H.R. 195, since the government shutdown was later seen as a Democratic tactic to demand legal protection for undocumented students. His campaign platform was largely based on supporting undocumented students.</p>\n<p>At an open forum, Carbajal representative Elijah Ettenger said that Carbajal voted for H.R. 195 to maintain private assistance for mudslide victims in Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>According to a Congressional Affairs Advisory document, certain requests for individual disaster assistance will no longer be possible during a government shutdown. These include requests for case management and crisis counseling, which would require review or approval from a furloughed employee.</p>\n<p>Trump has expressed openness to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/24/white-house-promises-new-immigration-framework-amid-stalled-negotiations-on-dreamers/?utm_term=.de1df0750fa9\">deal</a> that would create a path to citizenship for DACA recipients in exchange for funding of his promised wall at the border of the United States and Mexico. Valdivia did not offer an opinion on the possibility.</p>\n<p>“If you were to ask me and then you ask someone else, then their notion would be different,” she said. “It would be a political guess.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

id=\"caption-attachment-80581\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The sediment is made up of mostly sand and small rock mixed with debris, said Santa Barbara County Parks Department representative Daniel Gira. The debris comes from roadways, Montecito creeks and other affected areas in the Montecito mountains. A county permit calls for the disposal of some 300,000 cubic yards, which is the equivalent of 30,000 dump truck loads.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident that the vast majority of the material is just sand and sediment from the mountains and creeks,” said Santa Barbara Channelkeeper (SBCK) Watershed and Marine Program Director Ben Pitterle. “In Montecito, certainly there was structural debris and some hazardous waste that was mixed into that.”</p>\n<p>The mud disposed of at Goleta Beach is currently being analyzed in a local laboratory for heavy metals, organic compounds that are byproducts of wildfires and aquatic toxicity that can harm ecology.  Results of those tests will not be available until later this week.</p>\n<p>“In terms of the impacts, obviously if it wasn’t for retention basins, bridges, creeks, etc., much of the sediment would’ve found its way to the beach in Montecito, under natural circumstances,” Gira said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Flood Control conducted an initial screening of the debris and the contaminated soil is being bypassed by the central landfills.</p>\n<p>Gira said local beaches were heavily eroded by the 2015-2016 El Niño season, so the sediment can be seen as a “real treasure,” because white sand beaches are naturally formed from catastrophic flows, floods and fires, along with the sediments they produce.</p>\n<p>This is a chance for a counterpoint the mud effects, Gira said, since the sediment offsets the ongoing erosion.</p>\n<p>“The county is doing its best to get as much of the sediment as possible into a littoral cell,” he continued. “And when put on Goleta Beach, it’ll work its way down the coast, feeding all the beaches from Santa Barbara to Ventura.”</p>\n<p>Littoral cells are natural compartments on a coastline that complete cycles of sedimentation. These cycles sort through finer material like ash, which is carried away and deposited at the bottom of the ocean, while sand is retained on the beach.</p>\n<p>“So, it’s a tradeoff,” Gira said. “So far, we don’t know about any obvious water quality impacts. Every measure in an emergency has been taken to prevent them. My understanding is that S.B. County Flood Control is also going to implement sediment quality monitoring of some type.”</p>\n<p>The SBCK has done daily tests for fecal indicators of waters in disposal sites as well as local beaches like Campus Point at UCSB and Rincon Beach in Carpinteria. Santa Barbara County has conducted its own testing as well.</p>\n<p>Pitterle said that as of last week, the county was no longer testing for contaminants. The testing was limited to visual monitoring for larger debris like wood or structural material, which is then deposited at different locations, including Ventura County.</p>\n<p>Wildfires can affect the soil and water chemistry by decreasing nutrient concentrations, such as nitrogen.</p>\n<p>“So you can end up with algae blooms in subsequent years and we may see some of that,” said Pitterle, referring to how the recent Thomas Fire triggered the mudslides by altering the landscape.</p>\n<p>“I think what people are really worried about right now is the mud and toxicity — we just don’t have any answers yet,” Pitterle said, “Certainly, there are bacteria tests showing positive results for contamination, so we [SBCK] and county city officials are recommending that people stay out of the water at those beaches.”</p>\n<p>Pitterle said the bacteria results are improving near Campus Point and the water quality has met standards in the last couple of days.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking now for officials to address the muds being deposited on shore in other watersheds along roads or on other properties,” said Pitterle. “We definitely want to make sure that agencies are implementing what they call ‘best-management practices.’”</p>\n<p>The SBCK is ensuring containment of mud runoff. That way, during the next storm, new creeks and waterways will not be contaminated with that material.</p>\n<p>“A lot of it’s getting transported — I’ve heard as far west as Buellton. It’s in new areas that weren’t even impacted by the fire. We want to make sure those areas stay unimpacted,” Pitterle said.</p>\n<p>Limited resources and testing expenses have been obstacles for SBCK when sampling beach disposal sites. Road closures have also made certain areas inaccessible.</p>\n<p>“We are trying our best to balance our environmental concerns, many of which are valid with also the status of rescue efforts and emergency response that were necessary at the time,”  Pitterle said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article was corrected to clarify that heavy metals are not organic compounds, as the article previously stated due to an editing error.

restricting access to Isla Vista for product distributors based in southern California.</p>\n<p>The I.V. Food Cooperative, Hana Kitchen, Woodstock’s Pizza and other restaurants in I.V. are making menu changes as products are arriving late or not at all due to distributors using an alternate route on Interstate 5. This route involves circling back south toward I.V. from northern Santa Barbara County and takes hours longer than usual.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had produce delivered six hours late because they had to go all the way around,” Woodstock’s manager Cristy Wiebelhaus said.</p>\n<p>Sam’s To Go was forced to source produce from local vendors, and the restaurant’s meat distributors are using the longer route to make their deliveries.</p>\n<p>Representatives from Naan Stop, Pizza My Heart and Hana Kitchen told the <em>Nexus</em> they are also experiencing late deliveries.</p>\n<p>Hana Kitchen is currently not serving vegan bowls due to limited deliveries of ingredients. The restaurant only recently received their beef shipment. In addition, only mini bowls will be available until the restaurant receives a shipment of regular-sized boxes, allowing them to resume selling regular bowls.</p>\n<p>Lao Wang, which recently relocated from Goleta to Isla Vista in early 2017, is experiencing a beer shortage because certain vendors halted distribution after the highway closure.</p>\n<p>Caje, which sources its bagels from Jack’s Bagels in Carpinteria, has also encountered its own shortage.</p>\n<p>Caje general manager Troy Yamasaki told the <em>Nexus</em> that the restaurant has stopped selling bagels, as the cafe currently has a shortage of at least one-third of its bakery items.</p>\n<p>Caje will also temporarily not serve orange juice or use it as an ingredient, since their southern-California-based orange distributor is unable to make deliveries.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying, and we’re adjusting.” said Yamasaki. “More people are ordering our avocado toast, so we might see more permanent changes to our menu.”</p>\n<p>The I.V.
