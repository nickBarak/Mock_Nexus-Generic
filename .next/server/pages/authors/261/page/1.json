During the demonstration, approximately 25 students dressed in all black laid down in the plaza — representing an oil spill — while speakers around them read poems and spoke about the dangers of oil drilling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In her speech, Prufer referenced two Santa Barbara oil spills — the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-05-20/pipe-spills-21000-gallons-of-oil/\">2015 Plains pipeline spill at Refugio State Beach</a> and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, the latter of which launched the modern environmental movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early March demonstration was organized by CALPIRG to draw attention to the damage oil spills can cause. Governor Gavin Newsom </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/781040252/california-governor-cracks-down-on-fracking-requires-audits-and-scientific-revie\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">introduced a moratorium</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2019 that prohibits new high-pressure cyclic steaming extraction wells, requires permits that will be closely examined for adherence to new environmental regulations and introduces new rules for public safety, according to Chloe Kerr-Stein, a first-year writing &amp; literature major who works with CALPIRG. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the organization hopes to convince Newsom to ban oil drilling completely; the group met with him at the beginning of winter quarter with the hope of convincing him to do just that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Newsom] wanted to see overwhelming student support for the issue. So that’s what we’re showing him with these emails, with the people who came out today,” Kerr-Stein said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Jagger, the organizer for CALPIRG’s 100% renewable energy campaign, said she believes now is the time to divest from fossil fuels and do away with oil and gas drilling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “In the time of climate catastrophe, it doesn’t make sense to further the issue by drilling for a resource that we know isn’t renewable and that is actively harming our planet,” she said. “We already have momentum towards a renewable energy future, and we should be continuing to shift towards greener energy.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During her speech, Prufer also expressed concern that ExxonMobil </span><a href=\"https://keyt.com/news/local-politics/2019/11/13/santa-barbara-county-voters-oppose-exxonmobil-drilling-plan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aims</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to restart three oil rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They want to revive the threat of another catastrophic oil spill on our coast and in order to restart these platforms, they want to truck up to 70 truckloads of oil per day on California’s coast,” she said. “They want to do this for several years while they wait for Plains, the company that spilled in the first place, to rebuild that dirty pipeline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to California’s position as one of the leading states in environmentalism, Kerr-Stein stressed the importance of Californians taking action for environmental justice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“California is a really big player in just what other states do,” Kerr-Stein said. “One state tries something out, everyone sees that and they’re like, ‘Oh, it works for them.’ And then more states adopt it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prufer said she encouraged students to spread the word on social media, reach out to Gov. Newsom and urge the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to prevent offshore oil drilling in Santa Barbara. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jagger added that she believes students “need to act quickly” to help prevent any further damage from climate change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re already seeing the effects of climate change in fires raging across the Amazon, the Arctic, central Africa and Australia. We’re seeing continually shrinking sea ice and we’re also seeing intensifying weather events like Hurricane Dorian, which was the most powerful hurricane to ever hit the Bahamas,” Jagger said. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The buildings that have now fallen below UC standards are in a level VI category, which is labeled by the UCSB Design, Facilities &amp; Safety Services website as a high priority for correction. These buildings are the Chemistry and Biochemistry Building, Ellison Hall, Music Building, Phelps Hall, San Miguel Towers and San Nicolas Towers, according to the campus-wide email sent out by Garry Mac Pherson, vice chancellor for administrative administrative services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, 99 campus buildings or portions of those buildings have a rating of V, meaning they will require a “second, more thorough evaluation, and any confirmed seismic deficiencies will be addressed.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Mac Pherson’s email, engineers have been reevaluating the UCSB campus since 2018 based on new guidelines. The retrofitting and upgrading of buildings is expected to be completed by 2030, according to the email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As new science and technology become available, building codes are modified to incorporate advances in best practices and continually enhance building safety,” Mac Pherson said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since the 1970s, the University of California has been a leader both in seismic-structure research and in developing seismic policies and standards to address the risks that earthquakes pose,” Mac Pherson said in the email. “UC has set its standards for seismic safety higher than those associated with state and local building codes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even with the extra precautions taken by the University of California, earthquakes still pose a risk. According to the California Earthquake Authority, there is a </span><a href=\"https://www.earthquakeauthority.com/California-Earthquake-Risk/Faults-By-County?c=santa-barbara\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">75% chance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of at least one earthquake occurring in Southern California with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus will begin undergoing building upgrades in summer 2021, according to university spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Campus leadership is actively working on developing the schedule and sequencing of our seismic retrofit program to align with UC seismic safety policy. Currently for our housing facilities, the goal is to schedule the seismic retrofit projects over the summer months, when they are least likely to impact our student residents and occupancy rates,” Estrada said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plans for the upgrades are not yet complete, so it is not known what aspects of UCSB life will be affected yet. Estrada also expressed that it is unclear what will need to be repaired in order to maintain the high building rating.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92482\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92482\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-03/ucsb-to-undergo-building-upgrades-to-meet-earthquake-safety-standards/","id":3379,"author":{"id":261,"name":"Megan Ramsey"},"related":[3378,3377,3376],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/261"}},"__N_SSG":true}
