","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It is finally that time of the year again, folks. Spring Break has sadly come to an end, so we see ourselves fenced in for the first weekend back; however, in an effort to outweigh a multitude of rules and regulations comes the treat of a “welcome back” concert, with this year’s guests being RL Grime and Destructo. The third installment of this Gauchos-only event will commence Saturday in the Thunderdome at 8:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>Destructo has dutifully engineered his own approach to the EDM genre, with his music tending to interface with darker, more melodic sounds. This includes crossing over into genres EDM music typically contrasts with (similar to that of hip hop), creating a blend fans of either genre can approve of. His apparent hip hop influence becomes clear in features/videos with well-known hip hop artists like Warren G, YG and Ty Dolla $ign. Rather than just being a contributing factor to his songs, each individual artist he enlists serves as a critical ingredient to the vision he has mastered. It goes without saying that the West Coast EP would indeed not have been as equally compelling without the aid of highly established West Coast figures in the music industry.</p>\n<p>For those of us who are not too keen on the EDM genre, Destructo’s set is sure to be hip-hop-infused, making it a bit more palatable. Known for his generous utilization of colorful visuals and gas effects, you can guarantee this set will be one of “show” rather than “tell.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Los Angeles native Henry Steinway (also known as RL Grime), made his debut with the release of his first EP, Grapes, in 2012. Like Destructo, RL Grime has dappled in the combination of the hip hop and EDM genres through not only his numerous remixes of well-known hits, such as Chris Brown’s “Look at Me Now” and Rihanna’s “Pour it Up,” but in the production of music for hip hop artists Tory Lanez and Big Sean. He has caught the attention of publications like The Fader,and charted on both Billboard and iTunes.</p>\n<p>Although they certainly did not invent the traverse between EDM and hip hop music, each artist has undoubtedly added their own perspective on it. As a listener, there are certain details about production that go unnoticed/unappreciated in a piece, so this show may very well be an opportunity to make note of those details because they will assuredly be brought by both RL Grime and Destructo.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76661\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76661\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/program-boards-annual-warm-up-to-return/","id":6542,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6541,6540,6539],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Local Favorites Clean Spill Come to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12717810_936935369729500_887328006303710947_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12717810_936935369729500_887328006303710947_n.jpg?resize=960%2C639&ssl=1","description":"As Santa Barbara natives, the amount of feedback they received from the crowd was not only expected, but well-deserved.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I watched members from both Clean Spill and The Buttertones pace back and forth throughout the room, faces gleamed at the sight of their existence, and I, too, was overcome by the emotion that caused us all to gape in unison. The crowd was filled with seemingly familiar bodies all bent on making the most of their post-adolescence. From the grunge attire to the wavering course of conversation that struck the air, it was evident that this show attracted a particular scene. SOhO is home to an array of sounds, yet it often sees bands like Clean Spill leaving the comfort of Isla Vista and making a home on stage at their venue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clean Spill took the stage with lead vocalist Pat Curren capturing the center of the room in a bright red turtleneck, exhibiting the sort of confidence heard in his voice. He was visibly calm and collected, projecting any amount of anxiety he could have on to the crowd through a baffling amount of talent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Santa Barbara natives, the amount of feedback they received from the crowd was not only expected, but well-deserved. As someone who has seen the band numerous times, I have yet to hear them perform an identifiably similar setlist. Aside from songs like “Sid” and “Come Around,” their music can be exceptionally challenging to find via most music streaming platforms, so it is common for people to only know those particular songs. While one may come to hear a particular song, they may not only hear it but also experience something better. The band performed a song that I had yet to hear, knocking the crowd off of their feet and into something dressed to sound a little bit like love. After closing my eyes to make the most of this feeling, I opened them to see several people in the room doing the same.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Clean Spill ended, The Buttertones began an alternative journey through the soundtrack of an aching romance for their first-ever show in Santa Barbara. Each member took the stage decked in their own twist to their stylish attire, spouting sounds of angst and words of love. Watching them perform, drenched in the colors of the disco ball that orbited the space above them, aided to the art of their melodic, hopelessly romantic appeal, which caused the couples in the room to slow dance as if their hearts were on fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They brought a bit of everything to their set with old-school harmonies, saxophone and a combination of everything in between. Although furthest from the crowd, drummer Modesto “Cobi” Cobiån was perhaps the most enjoyable to watch as he drummed like there was a world inside of him. The visible vibrations off of the drumset and his head full of hair, which looked like it was trying to get a piece of the action, were by far too captivating to not take notice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With each progressing song, The Buttertones professedly became better and better.

Instead, his inimitable talent is masked by our perception of what genre(s) music should be categorized into. However, it has yet to alter the outcome of the electric melodies he continues to make.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marc E.

While we are fixated on the idea of genres, true artists separate themselves from musicians in the way that their crafts break the rules outlined for a variety of musical barriers. This is something that young minds like that of 21 Savage has accomplished, crowning him with the label of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">artist</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the world of hip-hop, we have been faced with an inexhaustible amount of “SoundCloud rappers” that make it difficult to distinguish what it is that sets true hip-hop artists apart from their kind. 21 Savage makes the distinction apparent in the way that he is able to flow in and out of this new wave of music by making songs that people enjoy, but not forgetting to stay true to his sound. He has made his mark in such a way that when a person hears something of his, they can easily say, “Yeah, this definitely a 21 Savage song,” or, “I bet 21 is on this track,” without having to check. It is a tough phenomenon to explain, but is incredibly apparent after both listening to his music and watching him take the stage. Lucky for Santa Barbarans, they will have the opportunity to experience 21 Savage’s infectious wave this Thursday at Velvet Jones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Atlanta  native is best known for his work with producer Metro Boomin along with his recent release, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savage Mode</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

This did not discourage 21 Savage but, rather, it pushed him to put more effort into his craft.

But, it will be easy for the entire audience to understand why this night has the potential to be one his best performances. He has shared larger stages with people like Young Thug, but it is the fact that we are able to see him solo and before he reaches his peak that makes this night special. 21 Savage is young, charismatic and will not filter himself for anyone. If you did not think he was a big deal, he will have you rethinking that by the end of his show.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74496\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74496\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-30/21-savage-to-hit-velvet-jones/","id":6759,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6758,6757,6756],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"SB Bowl Upcoming Picks","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footer_bowl-e1474527001793.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footer_bowl-e1474527001793.jpg?resize=800%2C387&ssl=1","description":"Artsweek writers preview their most anticipated shows at Nexus voters' favorite venue.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_72558\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footer_bowl-e1474527001793.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1799553855\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72557\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72558\" data-attachment-id=\"72558\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/footer_bowl/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footer_bowl-e1474527001793.jpg?fit=800%2C387&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,387\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"footer_bowl\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footer_bowl-e1474527001793.jpg?fit=250%2C121&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footer_bowl-e1474527001793.jpg?fit=888%2C429&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72558\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/footer_bowl-e1474527001793.jpg?resize=800%2C387\" alt=\"Courtesy of SB Bowl\" width=\"800\" height=\"387\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72558\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of SB Bowl</p></div>\n<p>In our youth, we find ourselves constantly attacked by a powerful adversary: our emotions. As we age, the number of obstacles we face increases (as does our frustration), so we cope through any outlet we see fit. There are a variety of ways to go about this, but most people choose to turn to music. The alluring comfort that comes with being able to find yourself in a song and letting it wash your troubles away is the reason I listen to music, and is a feeling bands like Blink-182 have mastered the art of creating.</p>\n<p>Blink-182 initially formed in Poway, California in 1992, but went into hiatus in 2005 after the departure of guitarist Tom DeLonge. The band rejoined forces in 2009, releasing their sixth album <em>Neighborhoods</em> two years later. However, DeLonge quit once again and was replaced by the band’s current guitarist/vocalist, Matt Skiba. With the recent release of their newest album <em>California</em>, Blink-182 embarked on a long-awaited tour across the country and will be bringing their adolescence-inspired pop-punk anthems to Santa Barbara Bowl Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>One would expect the band to have shifted their sound completely after making music for so long and going through several changes, but it is evident how much effort has gone into staying true to the core of their signature sound. <em>California</em> is nearly flawless when it comes to embodying the evolution of Blink-182’s sound, yet highlights the band’s fingerprint in each track, signaling “we’re still the same old band.” It includes angst-filled tales and anthems like “Bored to Death” and “Sober” that parallel with classic songs like “First Date” and “All the Small Things.” However, Blink does not neglect to appeal to the heart in a soulful ode to their home state, titled “California.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Pop-punk mainstays A Day to Remember and All-American Rejects will both be sharing the stage with Blink-182. All three acts have been in the genre for quite some time, so it is seemingly inevitable to come across one of their songs. If you grew up in the mid-2000s like me, then songs like “I Miss You” and “It Ends Tonight” are included in the soundtrack of your childhood. It goes without saying that if you’re punk and you’re proud, this is a show you will not want to miss.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>From its inception in 2012, Día de los Muertos at the Santa Barbara Bowl has been a jubilant and exciting celebration of local culture. Featuring theatre performances, art installations, dance groups, altars to remember our loved ones lost and live music (like last year’s incredible sets by Bomba Esteréo and Chicano Batman), the Day of the Dead celebration seemed perfectly whole, in need of no further improvement.</p>\n<p>And then they booked Morrissey.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 4, Moz himself will be performing at the Bowl, with support by the Mexican Institute of Sound and Rubén Albarrán. Pay attention on that Friday night, because chances are the streets of Santa Barbara are about to get both a lot more sincere and a little more sexually ambiguous. Here, Morrissey will be kicking off an international tour, immediately following his headlining appearance at Chicago’s Riot Fest.  He most recently released the <em>World Peace is None of Your Business</em> LP on Harvest Records, receiving a solid reception from critics and charting highly in both the U.K. and U.S.</p>\n<p>The Irish-English indie rock crooner has always had an incredibly strong fan base within the Chicano community, but is that really so strange? Morrissey’s songwriting style in many ways parallels traditional Mexican music genres such as <em>ranchero</em>; both are often intensely personal expressions about love, and they tackle issues of national identity as well. The notion of otherness, of continuously feeling like an outsider, also pervades Morrissey’s work in a way many Mexican-Americans find highly relatable. The sense of split cultural identity is a familiar one, as some immigrants to areas like Southern California may feel like they completely belong neither here nor back in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Morrissey’s parents migrated to Manchester from Dublin a year before his birth, and many of his lyrics deal with his sense of identity as an immigrant as well as an Englishman.  In the first half of his career, Moz fought against the appropriation and twisting of British identity by Margaret Thatcher and the neoliberal administration in the U.K. of the 1980s. During this time he was the lead singer of indie rock band The Smiths, which some have praised as being the most influential rock group of all time. In his time with The Smiths, Morrissey acted as an anti-pop icon, creating a bookish, quiet persona in stark contrast to the pageantry and glam of other contemporary pop groups. He dressed in cardigans and National Health Service glasses, and wore his celibacy like a badge of honor. He was so uncool that cool stopped looking appealing.</p>\n<p>In addition to dozens of other accolades, Morrissey is also regarded as one of the best British lyricists of all time. “I am human and I need to be loved,” “You can pin and mount me like a butterfly,” “Why do I smile at people who I’d much rather kick in the eye?” I could literally do this all day. The crippling sincerity of his words is still unmatched in the musical canon (although Yo La Tengo, Cat Power and others have come close).</p>\n<p>Having attended last year, I can attest that Santa Barbara’s Dia de los Muertos celebration is a wild and freakish ride, and sure to be made all the more so by the appearance of the sweet and tender hooligan himself. Do you think about life and death and find that neither of them particularly appeals to you? Well, think about seeing the most morbid man on Earth at a death-themed holiday celebration. It just might.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72557\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72557\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-09-22/sb-bowl-upcoming-picks/","id":6663,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6662,6661,6660],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Shut Up and Dance with Walk The Moon at SB Bowl","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rectangle.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rectangle.jpg?resize=624%2C420&ssl=1","description":"Walk The Moon is giving fans the chance to relive summer memories and obtain several more Friday, May 27 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, supported by MisterWives.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_70844\" style=\"width: 634px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rectangle.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1361532282\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70839\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70844\" data-attachment-id=\"70844\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-10/shut-up-and-dance-with-walk-the-moon-at-sb-bowl/rectangle/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rectangle.jpg?fit=624%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"624,420\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"rectangle\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rectangle.jpg?fit=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rectangle.jpg?fit=624%2C420&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70844\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rectangle.jpg?resize=624%2C420\" alt=\"Courtesy of rollingstone.com\" width=\"624\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rectangle.jpg?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rectangle.jpg?resize=250%2C168&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of <em>rollingstone.com</em></p></div>\n<p>As most summers are, the summer of 2011 was filled with sporadic twists, turns and adventures in the life of the average person. Regardless of what the details consisted of, if one were to compile a soundtrack for that summer it would include Walk The Moon’s youthful tune, “Anna Sun,” crafted as if it were made for that summer. Not just because it was named song of the summer by various publications, but because it is difficult to not associate it with breathless, unscathed memories accompanied by the feeling of lightning running wild through the heart. Walk The Moon is giving fans the chance to relive those memories and obtain several more Friday, May 27 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, supported by MisterWives.</p>\n<p>Walk The Moon is the type of band to release a song that will send your emotions spiraling, yet one tends to forget to take the time to get close with their music. There are numerous releases of good music day by day, so it makes it difficult to accomplish such a task. However, when it comes to Walk The Moon, it is rewarding to be more than merely familiar with their music; those that actually take the time to immerse themselves in their sounds might just discover their new favorite song.</p>\n<p>Similar to the love they received for “Anna Sun,” Walk The Moon received overwhelming attention for “Shut Up and Dance,” an upbeat, electric single from their latest album, <em>Talking is Hard</em>. In comparison to a number of their other tracks, the song proves difficult to sit through without singing or dancing from the heart. Out of all of their songs, both “Anna Sun” and “Shut Up and Dance” are the two that the band is commonly associated with, so one could expect to experience the joy flowing off of the stage and into the crowd as people sing in unison with every ounce of love spilling from their lungs.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

embarked on the musical journey of what would become their latest album, <em>Wiped Out. </em>Since the release of the album, the band has restlessly toured numerous cities across several countries. Sweater weather may be over for Santa Barbara natives, but as of this Tuesday, The Neighbourhood will be bringing it back in full force to the Majestic Ventura Theater. The show was originally booked at the Santa Barbara Bowl but made a move to the Majestic Ventura Theater, where all tickets will be honored.</p>\n<p>The two EPs <em>I’m</em> <em>Sorry </em>and <em>Thank You </em>and debut album <em>I Love You</em> respectively were the building blocks for the success of the band we as they are today. They became known for their black and white aesthetic, as seen in their scenic rotating clips for songs like “Flawless” and “WDYWFM,” along with their overall social media presence. With their appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” The Neighbourhood performed a stylish live television debut in black and white. Even after the departure of their original drummer Bryan Sammis, their status as the band to be on the lookout for remained, as did their loyal fanbase dedicated to decoding their cryptic melodies. In 2014 The Neighbourhood dropped a mixtape titled <em>#000000 &amp; #FFFFFF</em>. The mixtape consisted of several singles the band had previously released along with a few new ones featuring artists like YG, Raury and French Montana.</p>\n<p>After the release of the mixtape, however, the band went off the radar for a span of time to recover from the constant shows and festivals they had booked as well as to get to the root of what their next work of art would be. Out of this brief hiatus bloomed their sophomore album<em> Wiped Out!,</em> a fiery, complex treasure that would take all of their fans and critics by surprise. Listening to the album by its lonesome is a journey, so seeing The Neighbourhood bring it to life will be a vivid experience. There is no doubt that this band aims to please, and it would be an honor for anyone to say they were in attendance when the Majestic Ventura Theater got “wiped out.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The mind behind the music, Amber Bain, quickly surfaced within the music scene after numerous forms of recognition from The 1975 band members and after their thriving fan base sought answers to who exactly The Japanese House was and what about her music made her so infatuating. Bain’s melancholic melodies are mysteriously tranquilizing, and they served as an ideal preparation for a long night to come.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In addition to being the only opener for The 1975 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, The Japanese House proved to be a matchless candidate to complete such a task.

Bain’s music, like a fingerprint, is unique and complex to the extent that it would be nearly impossible to stick her with any label. Her music alone is numbing, yet it only intensified the experience that the audience was about to receive when the band that they all came to see took the stage.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70342\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-70342\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1918220204\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70462\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70342\" data-attachment-id=\"70342\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/the-1975-shake-it-up-at-sb-bowl/the1975-by-jenny-luo-online-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"THE1975 4/21\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-70342\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-9.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70342\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>A familiar ringing pierced the air, and the crowd grew silent as they recognized the tone as the cue for the beginning of what may become the best night of their lives. Rather than just gracing the stage, frontman Matty Healy went the extra mile and rode a bike onto the stage, which Santa Barbara—a bike-friendly community—definitely appreciated. As someone who has attended several of its shows, I can say that the band’s overall aesthetic is overwhelmingly alluring and timeless with each passing show. This aesthetic breathes into their stage presence and produces a combination their visuals and their sound.</p>\n<p>Like in most of their shows, there was a period of time in which the band performed their song “Me,” and Healy challenged everyone in attendance to live in the moment rather than trying to capture it with their phones. Although it proved difficult for some people, most obliged and could agree that it was one of the most memorable moments of the show. As the saxophone reigned in midway through the song, there was a moment when Healy lay against one of the visual boards, almost as if he were either drowning in colors or drowning in sadness. Whether the former or the latter, he sat there for a moment just being and bringing the entire crowd into existence. If the performance of the song alone was not enough to break down the metaphorical barriers between a band and a crowd, the following performance of their brilliantly lucid song, “fallingforyou,” tore down any feeling other than bliss in its wake.</p>\n<p>The show as a whole consisted of songs off of both their self-titled debut album and their sophomore album, <em>I Like It When You Sleep for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It. </em>With this, the crowd was able to get a better understanding of just how essential each band member is to the success of the band and how influential they are to The 1975’s sound as a whole. In songs like “You” and “Menswear,” the performance made evident the mastery lying within bassist Ross McDonald, the fact that Adam Hann is indeed a menace on the guitar and the reality that someone like George Daniel can have hands that appear to be crafted for his intense drumming, yet a mind that produces immensely beautiful sounds. There is also Healy, who gives his all into a performance and makes being bare seem so easy. There was a moment in “Loving Someone” when Healy gazed into the crowd as if he were pleading with them to understand something he could not quite put into words, yet hoping they would take from both the song and the performance, which was something I am certain that a lot of people missed. But for those who did not, it will resonate with them for many years to follow.</p>\n<p>The 1975 is a band that can say something with a combination of sounds that words can’t describe</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70340\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-70340\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1503712531\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"70462\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70340\" data-attachment-id=\"70340\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-28/the-1975-shake-it-up-at-sb-bowl/the1975-by-jenny-luo-online-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"THE1975 4/21\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-70340\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/THE1975-by-Jenny-Luo-ONLINE-7.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-70340\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>accurately alone.

Fans prepared themselves for what they thought might be the end of a beautiful era as well as a band they had come to not only know, but grow with. Various theories rose out of this act of disappearance, but most souls were put at ease when the band account, along with its members, resurfaced in a new color based on an entirely new mindset. The 1975 is the band that was able to pull off this reincarnation and emerge in a new light that no one ever saw coming.</p>\n<p>When people first heard The 1975, they envisioned a typical boyband surrounded by hormonal teenage girls in pursuit of a love that may never be. Admittedly, the band’s fan base is heavily weighted on the female end. This is not what it aimed to be identified with, and it is not what it envisioned people viewing them as. By deleting all forms of social media and essentially reinventing themselves, the members of the band have given people the opportunity to reject social norms and view them first for who they are as a band, along with the music they put forth, rather than labeling them in regards to their fan base.</p>\n<p>The music in itself speaks clearly about their ideas about society and even challenges the way that people view them, whether or not they think they know who The 1975 is. Before the release of their latest album, <em>I Like it When You Sleep for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It</em>, fans and media were granted the opportunity to get to know the band and the vision behind the album through numerous pop-up shops, interviews and listening parties. This humble, generous effort has allowed people to get a better sense of what the new era is all about.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It goes without saying that The 1975 is phenomenal when it comes to their artistry and their hunger to remain themselves despite the criticism they face. This sets them apart from other artists in the media. Their constant effort to enhance their aesthetic is evident in their performance, and it is exactly what makes them an absolute joy to watch live. There are many bands that rise in fame and fall behind the scenes never to be heard from again, but The 1975 is a band that could rise and fall with people still willing to move mountains to hear from them again. The beauty in their performance is so innocent and pure that it will change a person’s outlook on the world for days to follow. Santa Barbara natives have the chance to witness this beauty first-hand Thursday, April 21 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, and because the band is in demand in numerous parts of the world, there is no question that missing this show is a decision you’ll regret.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

artists that typically would not think to stop in the city. Thanks to the large capacity of the venue, SB is advancing on the charts as a concert city next to places like Los Angeles and San Diego and has even sparked the interest of arising hip hop legend G-Eazy. G-Eazy will be making a stop in Santa Barbara on the second leg of his “When It’s Dark Out” tour Tuesday, April 19 and, as per usual, will not make his exit without leaving his mark on the beautiful city.</p>\n<p>Young Gerald, aka G-Eazy, knew from the beginning that he was going to make it big, yet he remained humble and let other people find out for themselves just how good he is. His lyrics are often misinterpreted as being filled with the typical tangents of cockiness that rappers rant about in the midst of their fame; however, G-Eazy’s perception of himself and what he is capable of has remained constant throughout his music even as he evolves as an artist. When this is attributed to his character, it is easy to decode the messages in his music in a negative light and dislike him as a person. On the contrary, his love for his fans is monumental, and it is evident that he will not rest until he puts the Bay Area on the map. As well as repping the Bay, he is known for collaborating with a number of well-known artists like Mod Sun, Blackbear, Kehlani and Marc E. Bassy.</p>\n<p>Even with the restless back-to-back shows on his lengthy tours, G-Eazy found the time to open another leg of “When It’s Dark Out” shows after the release of the album. The album itself received an overwhelming amount of reviews from astounded critics on various social media outlets and music blogs. The first leg of the tour featured surprise guest appearances from artists like Chris Brown, YG, ASAP Ferg and Diddy, leading fans to describe his shows as something directly out of a movie. That being said, when G-Eazy books a show, he brings a show. Fans at the Santa Barbara Bowl will be in for a treat and will get to discover exactly what things happen when it’s dark out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The spacious events center transformed into a large venue, providing both standing room and seating accommodations, yet most of the crowd were without a doubt drawn to the stage. Despite doors opening at 8:00 p.m., nearly two hours went by before the opening act, Tor Miller, took the stage. In most cases this would call for an uproar of anger from the crowd, but there were no hints of angst threatening to taint the atmosphere. Whether it was the feeling of being surrounded by peers who understood or the number of impaired people in the crowd, the night was too mystic to let impatience get in the way.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69614\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69614\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1497867743\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69608\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69614\" data-attachment-id=\"69614\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/grouplove-warms-it-up-at-deltopia-show/grouplove-by-lorenzo-basilio-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?fit=350%2C233&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"350,233\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Grouplove by Lorenzo Basilio 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69614\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Grouplove-by-Lorenzo-Basilio-3-e1460016857753.jpg?resize=350%2C233\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69614\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Just as the crowd seemed to be losing an ounce of hope, Tor Miller and band took the stage and set the tone for a night that would send everyone present through a spiral of emotions. He may have been a New York native, but the students at UCSB welcomed him with open arms. Although most people were not aware of who he was, he was captivating enough to keep their attention. His stage presence — along with the band members that surrounded him — allowed him to do so. Much to the crowd’s dismay, a portion of his set was a bit on the slower side, yet it enhanced the vitality of songs to follow when the songs did pick up the pace.</p>\n<p>Tor Miller was particularly enjoyable because of his ability to shift between various styles of sound. It is evident in his performance alone that he takes the risk of toying around with various genres instead of finding one that works and sticking with it. Every soulful, alluring song aided to the feeling of wanting to stay inside that room just a little longer.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The room erupted in the weight of a thousand lights intensifying with every scream. It was apparent that the band was happy to be there, and the crowd only reciprocated the feeling. The connection between the band and the crowd was dynamic, and the rapport among the students alone was fascinating. The sublime unison could only be explained through the music that played in the background, and while getting lost in the moment, the realization came that this performance was something that only UCSB students had experienced. Rather than just simply seeing Grouplove do what they do best and calling it a night to remember, it became a night to remember because we were able to experience together.</p>\n<p>Grouplove’s energy, along with their artistry, is unequivocal. There is no questioning the fact that they brought a much needed revival to the campus after a long break. It was an extravagant night that one just had to be there to experience, especially with the performance of their hit single, “Tongue Tied.” Every bit of apprehension evaporated the further they went down the set list, and it would be an understatement to say that the school will miss them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Program Board</em></p></div>\n<p>When people hear the name Grouplove, they envision an endless loop of paint-splattered, angst-filled teens singing “Tongue Tied” as loudly as humanly possible. While this idea may seem appealing to some people, it diminishes the reality of what the band is actually capable of. No matter what Grouplove is depicted to be, they have a song for everyone, and this Saturday at the Thunderdome they will grace each UCSB student with the immense artistry that lies in every one of their songs.</p>\n<p>Grouplove formed with its five members in 2009 purely out of passion, and these friends were unaware of just how big they were going to become. After playing their first show mid-2010, they proceeded to go on tour with bands like Foster the People, The Joy Formidable, and Florence + the Machine. After just two short years of being together, the name Grouplove was on everyone’s radar, and before they knew it they were performing explosive sets at large festivals like Glastonbury, Coachella, Outside Lands and Lollapalooza to name a few.</p>\n<p>In the midst of these defining performances, the band managed to release both their self-titled EP, <em>Grouplove</em>, and their debut album, <em>Never Trust a Happy Song</em>, all in the same year. <em>Never Trust a Happy Song</em> features their hit single, “Tongue Tied,” and if that song alone is not reason enough to see them live, both the debut album and EP feature blissful, captivating sounds. The melodies tend to be contradictory in the way they appear when compared to the meaning behind the songs, but that is what separates Grouplove from other, more ordinary acts. There is no attempt to sound like anyone else, nor is there an attempt to market happiness by pretending to be happy. The concept that someone can listen to them and battle a multitude of feelings that have nothing to do with happiness but still feel overwhelmed by the forthcoming perception of joy is what makes this band so alluring. Their live set only amps up this joyousness, with the band members playfully and energetically hopping around to hype up their ecstatic audience.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although this is not the way that many people pictured spending their first weekend back from Spring Break, this alternative makes other options seem inferior.

Gnash as an artist is particularly unique because he is able to create his own genre with such subtlety that there is no room for comparison. Many have debated the idea, but he neither identifies as a singer nor rapper, nor solely a DJ, but just as an artist. Attempting to label his creativity would be difficult, so if, for whatever reason, necessity called for a label, it would simply be “Gnash.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gnash, along with Goody Grace and Julius, is a Los Angeles local, and he is certainly not a stranger to the scene. Performing at shows with artists like Kehlani, Mod Sun and Blackbear, his fan base has expanded enormously over the last several years. He has been friends with these artists for some time, so it is not accurate to say that this is where his fan base originated from, but rather it helped him to become known to the people who had looked past him for some time. His first EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is crafted as a vivid representation of someone who has loved and lost, yet refuses to let it tear them down completely. This is a common theme throughout his early music, giving people an inside look at his heart and mind while also letting people know that is okay to feel something even when it feels like it can destroy you. Gnash’s latest EP, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Me</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, includes this similar truth, but it is much more lively. As he stated in an Instagram post immediately following the release of the EP, it includes many of the life lessons he has learned about moving on and being content with being alone, a healing that is completely evident between the lines of every track. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gnash’s music is all about his journey, and it makes it easier to get to know him as a person. If his sounds are ever too difficult to follow (which is nearly impossible), then it is a joy to get to know his personality through the updates he provides for his “dreamers” via Twitter and Snapchat. His love for his fans shows through his constant hard work and interactions, and there is never a time in which you would second guess supporting him. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opportunity to experience Gnash’s music live comes around often, but it increases with intensity with each performance. His energy on stage is overwhelming, and his ability to adapt to any stage or fan base is what makes his performances so enjoyable. If someone is not familiar with his music, they will be sure to check him out after the show. For someone who has seen Gnash a number of times, I know for a fact that he will bring everything he has to the stage. Everything he does, he does it for the people that support him, and he is never quick to forget that his fans are the backbone of his success in addition to his worth ethic. Velvet Jones is a very intimate venue, so it will only enhance the Gnash experience. Getting to see Goody Grace and Julius (who are featured on several songs with Gnash) alongside him is going to make this show go down history. Santa Barbara will be raving about these Los Angeles natives for days, and the lucky ones will be able to say they were there to experience it.</span></p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/gnash/ihateuiloveu</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68934\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68934\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-08/gnash-to-bring-me-my-friends-to-velvet-jones/","id":6773,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6772,6771,6770],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Olés Return to Isla Vista","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-3-2-ole.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-3-2-ole.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Finals season is fast approaching, and what better way to end a grim Winter Quarter than with an astounding show from Isla Vista’s very own The Olés.

The recently graduated Olés have acquired their own enticing twist on reggae and hip hop supplemented with some classic rock. The combination is typically hard to pull off, but it proves to not be a great challenge for this band. The Olés are not only verified on Spotify, but they have an overwhelming amount of supporters across the state of California. Aside from their numerous fan base, their music speaks for itself in a very humble form of musical complexity. Their California roots run deep; it is apparent in their sound, and it is what gives them the edge that most bands seek: a mixture of soft vocals and electric melodies that no other band could match. This is what drove a number of I.V. natives to jump at the chance to see them in action.<br>\nAfter recently embarking on their Southern California tour, members Matt Tweed, Cole Leksan, Daniel Kearney, Eric Lordan, Nicholas Marks, Dominick Burham and Westin Byerly made their return to the town of I.V. and were welcomed back with open arms. A Facebook invite created for the event went out before the show, and its attendees totaled nearly 1,000 people for this long-awaited concert. The buzz surrounding the show via word of mouth was immense compared to the typical talk of an Isla Vista concert or party. It is not rare for people to just come across a band they had not been anticipating in Isla Vista, but for The Olés, there was little promotion that had to be done because all of their fans were doing it for them. In the days approaching the show, it was not uncommon to be asked, “Hey, are you seeing The Olés this weekend?” or, “Yes, I saw the Facebook invite; I am definitely going!” The closer it came to the day of the show, the more the anticipation increased to finally see the band that everyone and their mother could not stop talking about.<br>\nThe show lineup included sets from Atomic Walrus, Zeek Beats &amp; Caleto and, finally, The Olés. Sueno, and of course Isla Vista in its entirety, filled with the upbeat, radiant sounds of the band that we all came to see. Like any other Saturday night, you saw drunk people flinging their limbs in rhythms they hoped came off as dancing. Everyone was in sync with each other, and while their love for The Olés poured out of their hearts and lungs, the band reciprocated the feelings by giving their all to their performance. Whether it was the fact that the guys were incredibly in tune with each other or the fact that they were playing in the heart of the town they had a great amount of love for, it was one of the most emotional performances that an Isla Vistan could experience and the band would have the opportunity to play. Sober or not, there is no forgetting the union of the glowing lights with the gray smoke in the cold night that enhanced every chord and every vocal melody. Although nothing could beat seeing them where it all began, The Olés are stopping by Velvet Jones and a few other local venues, and it would be an understatement to say that they are worth checking out. Do yourself a favor and catch them while you can.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68840\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68840\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-03/the-oles-return-to-isla-vista/","id":6808,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6807,6806,6805],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"XYLØ and FMLYBND Take Over Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/png-355x230.","mobile_thumbnail":"https://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/png-980x647.","description":"It took me by surprise when I read about XYLØ’s upcoming show dates and I did not see one for Los Angeles, but dates for both San Francisco and Santa Barbara.

XYLØ is a duo based out of L.A., but their fan base has already spread across the world in a very short amount of time. I had the opportunity to speak with David (last name declined), a local longtime hard rock aficionado, before the show began, and he emphasized that “… it took me a while to get into other forms of music … XYLØ is just someone you cannot help but let draw you in.” He was indeed correct with this statement, because XYLØ (along with FMLYBND, Blues and Greys and another local opening act) drew in a full house at Velvet Jones on a frosty Saturday night.</p>\n<p>Velvet Jones as a venue is pretty small and intimate, but this often is an advantage for artists because it makes it easier to interact with the crowd. It also gives the fans an opportunity to engage with their favorite bands or artists. However, if you are under the age of 21, you will on occasion be required to watch the show from the upstairs balcony. This being my first time at the venue, it felt slightly like the “walk of shame,” and it also made it difficult to interact with other fans and possibly network with the performers. Besides this minor problem, Velvet Jones is a decent-sized venue with quality sound, and some of the best macaroni and cheese you have ever tasted.</p>\n<p>The Blues and Greys were an opener for the night, and in contrast to their music style, they played a fairly mellow set. The crowd was in tune with their performance, but oddly, I found them almost easy to ignore. Their lead vocalist has a lot of potential, but I felt the performance would have been a lot better if she would have focused on her vocals rather than her stage presence. I found her movements distracting, and awkward at times, but when I really zeroed in on their sound, I actually enjoyed it. The Blues and Greys possess a sound similar to the earlier days of Paramore, but they nailed the task of taking that sound and making it their own.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Up next would be XYLØ, and from the moment they took the stage, I felt like I was back in a Los Angeles venue myself. Lead vocalist Paige Duddy has a way of taking your gaze and running with it from the second she begins performing to the time she leaves the stage. XYLØ is comprised of brother and sister Paige and Chase Duddy, along with Leonard Newell and Nick Truhan, with a chemistry that makes it an absolute masterpiece. I firmly believe that if anyone different were placed in any of their positions, the band would not possess the soaring energy it does. If one were to attempt to label their stage presence, it would only undermine what it actually is. Every bit of magic poured all throughout the venue, and I could not help but praise as if I were in a church on a delightful Sunday morning. XYLØ will not be playing on small stages for long, so I would advise seeing them while one still has the luxury of watching them at a small, yet intimate venue.</p>\n<p>FMLYBND took the stage last, and as they are Santa Barbara locals, the crowd was all too excited to see them perform. After touring with names like Milky Chance, playing huge festivals and even having a song featured on FIFA 15, it is a homecoming gift to see them play again at such an intimate venue. They were alive, electrifying even, and their grunge take on electronic music is unlike anything I have ever heard before. In every song they performed, there was a clear representation of the use of multiple instruments. Personally, I like to think of FMLYBND as a mixture between MGMT and M83, but when you factor in the rosy vocals and the mystical instruments, there is no way to place them in between anything. Their performance was the revitalization I needed after a very long night.</p>\n<p>Overall, the show was one worth giving up a Saturday night for. Each band had something more to contribute to the previous set, and they did so in a timely fashion. Although it was a pain not being able to talk to any of the bands after, I would do it all again and I would not change a thing if I could hear all of these great bands play together again.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BR74ZadqjNA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-28/xylo-and-fmlybnd-take-over-velvet-jones/","id":6821,"author":{"id":700,"name":"Tracy Smith"},"related":[6820,6819,6818],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/700"}},"__N_SSG":true}
