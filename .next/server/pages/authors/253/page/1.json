The park is now mid-project, and access to the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road remains limited.</p>\n<p>According to Liz Buda, vice chair of the IVRPD, the organization initiated the project late last month.</p>\n<p>“We had our general meeting on February 23, and that was when we decided to spend the money, so [construction began] probably around the end of the month,” Buda said.</p>\n<p>Buda said the organization is funding the project with revenue from state grants for the Anisq’Oyo’ Bridge renovation.</p>\n<p>“Basically our general manager really understands the permit process, so we ended up with more money for projects besides the bridge,” Buda said. “One is to expand the Frisbee golf course to regulation size, as well as [add] some new benches.”</p>\n<p>Buda said the project is scheduled for completion at the end of the month, in compliance with state funding guidelines.</p>\n<p>“The construction will be done at the end of March. The thing with these grants is you have to spend all the money by March 31.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-34719\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-12/iv-park-receive-renovations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-34719\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-12/iv-park-receive-renovations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-12/iv-park-receive-renovations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-12/iv-park-receive-renovations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-03-12/iv-park-receive-renovations/","id":4807,"author":{"id":253,"name":"Garik Hauer"},"related":[4806,4805,4804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Who’s Who in the County","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Whether you are a first year student or fifth year veteran, it is essential to recognize the movers and shakers within the county.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Whether you are a first year student or fifth year veteran, it is essential to recognize the movers and shakers within the county.

The victim was rushed to the hospital after brief questioning.</p>\n<p>“The victim said he was knocked out cold, and deputies saw blood was on his mouth,” Padilla said. “The officers noted that the victim appeared highly intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>An hour later, deputies responded to another fight that began when an intoxicated man was attacked while sleeping on his couch at home.</p>\n<p>“The victim was passed out on the living room couch,” Padilla said. “An unknown male attacked him while he was on the couch and hit him multiple times in the face.”</p>\n<p>According to Padilla, the fight was instigated earlier in the evening when the victim of the fight assaulted the attacker’s girlfriend.</p>\n<p>“She was at a party and was kneed in the abdomen by the male victim,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>Padilla said because the suspect fled the scene after the attack, authorities have been unable to identify him.</p>\n<p>Officers also responded to two residential thefts over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Burglars stole a laptop computer from a residence on the 6600 block of Sueno Road at 4 a.m. Saturday morning. Later during the weekend, thieves took a camera, two camera lenses and a watch from a residence on the 6700 block of Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>In both cases, thieves entered through unlocked windows or doors. Padilla said these thefts might have been avoided if residents had taken precautions prior to leaving their homes.</p>\n<p>“It is really unfortunate that this happens so frequently,” Padilla said. “For whatever reason they leave their places unlocked or their windows open, and people are able to come inside and take their belongings.”</p>\n<p>Deputies also encountered a case of vandalism Saturday night when a Foot Patrol officer spotted a woman defacing a vehicle on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. The officer stopped the vandal and questioned her, but chose not to make an arrest.</p>\n<p>“The female suspect was detained by the officer, but for whatever reason he decided not to arrest her. Maybe she was being cooperative,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>Authorities took the woman’s contact information and plan to ask the owner of the vehicle if they want to press charges at a later date.</p>\n<p>Officers handled a typical number of alcohol-related crimes over the weekend. Eight individuals were arrested for public intoxication and nine were issued minor in possession citations. Deputies also issued 10 citations for possession of open containers.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-23848\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-23848\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-05-24/weekend-crime-wrapup/","id":3839,"author":{"id":253,"name":"Garik Hauer"},"related":[3838,3837,3836],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/253"}},"__N_SSG":true}
