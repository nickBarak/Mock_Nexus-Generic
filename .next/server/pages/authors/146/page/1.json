AAAC is organizing the event with the United States Student Association, the Associated Students (A.S.) Office of the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA), the A.S. Office of the Student Advocate and UCSB-4-Bernie.</p>\n<p>Event organizer and second-year mathematics major Kyle Butts said the UC Board of Regents treats the University as more of a corporate entity than an academic institution, beginning when Ronald Reagan became governor of California.</p>\n<p>“Reagan ushered in an era of neoliberal thinking in California while he was governor,” Butts said. “That coupled with 17 Regents being business men who serve 12 year terms and only one student Regent, it is pretty clear that the UC is a business now to them.”</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the march will partially address how the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education, which reaffirmed California’s prior commitment to the principle of tuition-free education, has been abandoned.</p>\n<p>“This is evident in when Governor Schwarzenegger and the UC Regents met in 2004 for the Compact for Higher Education,” Butts said. “There they made clear that students and donations would be the primary sources of funding instead of state funding.”</p>\n<p>Butts said tuition-free college is attainable.</p>\n<p>“If we decide that it is time for our school to return to a true public university, we can make it happen,” Butts said.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference.<br>\n–<em> Josephine Ampaw</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Event organizer and third-year political science and feminist studies double major Josephine Ampaw said she hopes the Teach In AAAC hosted last week succeeded in educating students on tuition and debt and inspired attendees to affect change.</p>\n<p>“I hope this course of action will first off be taken seriously by our city, state and national leaders, who will execute a plan in order to make free higher education a reality after bringing the demands to the center stage,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Ampaw, accessible higher education is an investment in the future of the country.</p>\n<p>“I believe students have to fight for free tuition because education is a right, not a privilege,” Ampaw said. “Every person who lives in the state of California, in the United States and across the globe deserves the right to not only a elementary and secondary education, but to a higher education as well.”</p>\n<p>Ampaw said California has had tuition-free public higher education in the past.</p>\n<p>“Residents of California did not have to pay to go to a university like UC Santa Barbara fifty years ago, so I ask what makes us different from the students 50 years ago. I say there is no difference,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, the demand for a $15 minimum wage for all UC workers aims to facilitate the “American Dream.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a whole class of people who aren’t given the same opportunity as middle and upper middle-status people. With expensive public education and a $9 minimum wage, they as a collective are not able to overcome poor conditions with hard work,” Butts said. “Instead, the Million Student March is trying to level the playing field and create accessible forms of social mobility.”</p>\n<p>Butts said UCSB is a hub for student political engagement.</p>\n<p>“Looking at the history of UCSB and the UC system as a whole, I think we’re the heart of the student movement,” Butts said. “By hosting the march here at UCSB, we’re simply entering the long history we’ve had in activism.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major Hannah Houska said the “the fight is now” against tuition hikes, because UC’s tuition freeze will end at the 2017-18 academic year.</p>\n<p>“Our goal is not to continue the cycle of tuition hike and tuition freeze, but rather our goal is to lower tuition,” Houska said.</p>\n<p>According to Butts, #MillionStudentMarch will encourage students to be more politically active.</p>\n<p>“Come Thursday, it will be clear that frustration will bring students out,” Butts said. “It would be so easy to not come, but a million students across this country are going to have this issue be talked about, so activism is alive and well here at UCSB.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Companies which provide services to the UC through contracting will also be required to comply with the new minimum wage policies. According to a UCOP press release, the cost of the wage increases will be covered by “non-core funds” such as bookstores and food services, which are separate from “core fund” revenue sources, which include tuition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fifth-year sociology major Alberto Perez said the plan benefits full-time UC and UC contract workers, but excludes student workers who typically only work 20 hours per week at most while attempting to provide for tuition and living costs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For student workers, the UC has had this kind of unspoken rule that suggests students don’t work over 20 hours because it might cut into their schoolwork and education, which makes sense in most cases,” Perez said. “However, you have … students that need to work at least 20 hours to be in school in the first place.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Perez, the limitations of the new minimum wage hike and exclusion of certain employees have been overlooked in favor of “positive press” for the UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So their motivation is trying to be the beacon of light,” Perez said. “The one minor detail that nobody really covered is that many employees are left out.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President of the UC Student-Workers Union (UAW 2865) and graduate student at UC Santa Cruz Robert Cavooris said the UC has good intentions with the minimum wage increase, but the exclusion of many part-time workers is questionable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC trying to encourage workers with this increase is laudable, but the way they are doing it doesn’t really seem to show that they care about all of their workers,” Cavooris said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Cavooris, the limitations of the plan are difficult to amend because UC Office of the President (UCOP) is directly in charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t know that there are any specific union actions planned, however, we know that when people are together and working together, workers are in a better position to have more power,” Cavooris said. “So this is the best thing we can do to ensure that people get a fair wage and we have power as workers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cavooris said unionization will be critical to ensuring worker benefits for all UC employees as the plan develops further. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a totally top-down initiative on one level … it also is related to a more general climate of work connectivity across the country which includes the fight for $15 an hour in many industries,” Cavooris said. “We’re organizing ourselves to make sure we can continue to push for things like this in the future, while making sure this doesn’t just apply to a few workers again.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second-year electrical engineering major Himangshu Chowdhury said he thinks the announcement is a step in the right direction, and he hopes more wage increases will follow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just don’t think UC has the budget to universally increase wages for every worker at the moment,” Chowdhury said. “Hopefully, as they revise their budget, student workers will see more benefits follow in the near future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Perez, the UC would rather hire more workers with fewer hours than take on the costs of an increased minimum wage for part-time employees. Perez also said the wage increase affects him as a part-time employee at Portola dining commons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The students never will see the $13 hours, and on top of that students will have less to work with, so that’s the concern that I have … a lot students like myself that have to work at least 20 hours to get by,” Perez said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perez said if the UC aims to cut costs and students lose the freedom to increase hours, productivity and morale will decrease. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Things come up for students, and they will want to have the flexibility to work more … if they can’t, they might quit, causing management to hire more people which we have to train, and thus productivity goes down in general,” Perez said. “Ultimately, I just feel the UCOP put this policy out there without thinking what it means for certain people.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64879\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64879\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-28/uc-wage-increase-excludes-student-workers-part-time-employees/","id":2700,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2699,2698,2697],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sexual Assault Bill Allowing Punishment for Off-Campus Offenses Passes Unanimously","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HBJ.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HBJ.jpg?resize=378%2C567&ssl=1","description":"Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s Senate Bill 186 (SB 186) passed the senate floor with a unanimous 63-0 bipartisan vote on Monday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><b></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s Senate Bill 186 (SB 186) passed the senate floor with a unanimous 63-0 bipartisan vote on Monday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SB 186, introduced by Jackson in February, would allow California community colleges to discipline students for off-campus sexual assault and sexual exploitation violations. The bill successfully passed through the senate and currently awaits approval by Governor Jerry Brown, who can sign it into law. University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) campuses currently have jurisdiction to expel, suspend or enact disciplinary action on students who commit sexual assault, but not the authority to punish students for incidents that happen off campus grounds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson said the bill’s success was backed by the common understanding that all college students from UCs, CSUs and community colleges should be held accountable for crimes such as sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think, clearly, if everyone has to meet to the same standards, there won’t be the sense that someone can get away with something that another can’t,” Jackson said. “So there’s going to be accountability, and hopefully there will be disciplinary action in both circumstances.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Jackson, the bill mandates punishments such as expulsion and suspension for students found guilty of sexual assault regardless of whether or not the incident happened within or outside of campus boundaries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will be monitoring this to make sure that disciplinary proceedings are effective and are pursued when there are allegations of rape and sexual assault,” Jackson said. “It is my expectation that I have discussed with the universities that they will follow this law and abide by it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) President Lori Gaskin said the unanimous passage of the bill gives the administration jurisdiction to punish crimes that happen outside of campus to ensure the safety of the student body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our first priority is for student safety,” Gaskin said. “We do not tolerate violations of our college student code of conduct on any of our three campuses, and this measure would extend that authority for sexual assault and other serious student misconduct outside our campus boundaries.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaskin said she hopes the concerns of students and administration will continue to be heard regarding issues concerning safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We thank Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who proposed this specific bill, and will continue to work with our local elected officials to ensure safety on all our local college campuses,” Gaskin said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Gaucho Consent coordinator and alumna major Lexi Weyrick said if community colleges have procedures in place to properly adjudicate accused students, then the bill is a “no-brainer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Students are agreeing to a code of conduct when they attend school, just like at UCSB, and if students violate that code, it is absolutely within the school’s rights to take action as they see fit,” Weyrick said. “This bill simply gives community colleges the ability to act within those rights in regard to sexual violence, which makes sense.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Weyrick, the bill will ensure both UCSB and SBCC students who live in Isla Vista are on the same page regarding discipline for sexual assault.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think SB 186 opens the door for greater communication between UCSB and SBCC regarding sexual violence that occurs in Isla Vista which has been very inconsistent in the past,” Weyrick said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson said it is important to inform students of tolerable behavior, and SB 186 would hold students accountable for sexual assault just as they would be held accountable for academic issues such as plagiarism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Part of the whole issue here is empowering victims and educating students both male and female about what is acceptable and not-acceptable behavior,” Jackson said. “Colleges can expel students for things like plagiarism, so if they have the tools and procedures in place to deal with that kind of behavior, then they should certainly have the tools to discipline students for behavior as serious as rape or sexual assault.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

id=\"caption-attachment-63892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The ability to hold a memorial in this way for those lost last May is unique and deeply personal to the UCSB and Isla Vista community. Last year’s Paddle Out was hugely successful in helping many to find solace on the water and to recognize the hope and strength that comes from community. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Hundreds of UC Santa Barbara students and Isla Vista residents attended the second annual I.V. Memorial Paddle Out Wednesday evening at the beach north of Campus Point to commemorate the lives of the six students lost in the tragedy of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>UCSB Surf Team hosted the event with help from lifeguards and safety personnel who led attendees with boards and floatation devices into high tide. Onlookers who did not enter the water watched from the beach and surrounding cliffs as participants in the ocean formed a circle to symbolize solidarity, similar to the one formed a year ago.</p>\n<p>Associated Students (A.S.) Assistant Director for Community Affairs Aaron Jones said the Paddle Out represents healing and is the “perfect ending” to the series of memorial events paying homage to the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>“In my humble opinion, doing it in the ocean is, in itself, a healing and a cleansing act,” Jones said. “I think many community members that participated this evening intrinsically recognized the event.”</p>\n<p>Fifth-year philosophy major and UCSB Surf Team member Alex Banks said the event was unique way to pay condolences to the students lost last year due to I.V.’s close proximity to the beach.</p>\n<p>“We have this beautiful ocean, and paddling out and surfing is a great way to pay respect to people that have passed away, regardless of the circumstances,” Banks said. “The fact that we have this resource is cool, and I think it’s a very inviting and serene atmosphere.”</p>\n<p>First-year biology major Anne Trinh said she was not present during the events of May 23 last year, but still felt the Paddle Out strengthened the sense of community.</p>\n<p>“Being able to come out makes everyone feel like they are part of the community,” Trinh said. “So taking part in remembering those we lost, and recognizing what happened really allows us to come together, no matter how long you’ve been here.”</p>\n<p>Jones said the Paddle Out took on a “jubilant” atmosphere when people on the shore cheered for a couple’s pitbull wearing a life jacket struggling to stay on the surfboard while the couple tried to Paddle Out.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63894\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63894\" data-attachment-id=\"63894\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-28/gauchos-paddle-out-as-one/paddle-out-2015_by-lorenzo-basilio-web-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=2000%2C1125&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1125\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D610\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1432751953\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"160\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Paddle Out/Sunset 2015\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-63894\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=600%2C338\" alt=\"Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Paddle-Out-2015_by-Lorenzo-Basilio-Web-4.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-63894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“It was after everyone had started paddling out and they were trying to catch up,” Jones said. “But the waves started to kick up and they just couldn’t get the dog out there on the board. A wave would come over and knock him off the board and people would be like, ‘Oh no, oh no,’ and it was that kind of fun community vibe.”</p>\n<p>According to Banks, the presence of lifeguards, water patrol and emergency responders contributed to the sense of community for those participating in the event, because it showed solidarity between the county and local residents.</p>\n<p>“The fact that we got all these different agencies like the fire department and police to come out and watch over this event just promotes what we’re trying to do here even more,” Banks said.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year political science major and Humans of UCSB Photographer Alex Nguyen said the event felt more optimistic and celebratory compared to last year’s Paddle Out, which focused on the community’s strength dealing with tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Last year’s Paddle Out was a reflection of what it means to be a Gaucho in the wake of a tragedy,” Nguyen said. “This year’s is more of a celebration of knowing what it means to be a Gaucho and the strength this community has gained over the last year.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the Paddle Out is symbolic of UCSB’s dedication to serving the environment and overcoming difficulties in light of the recent oil spill near Refugio.</p>\n<p>“There was discussion about whether or not it would affect the Paddle Out, which was planned months ago,” Jones said. “I think there’s also a consciousness about our environment, about the beauty of environment, about protecting our environment that is symbolized in the Paddle Out itself.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, May 28, 2015 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Clinic building are currently underway, and new tenants providing mental health reseources for I.V. residents are set to move in in July. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors approved a renovation budget of approximately $335,000 for the Isla Vista Clinic building on Tuesday to refurbish and lease currently vacant office spaces.</p>\n<p>The planned renovations will allow for additional tenants to lease office spaces in the building, one-third of which is currently used by I.V. Clinic. Of the nine organizations who applied for a lease, Santa Barbara County general services staff chose the Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, Regents of the University of California and Isla Vista Youth Projects Inc. for the clinic. All three are slated to sign five-year leases and to agree to a three percent annual rent increase.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Assistant Director for General Services Greg Chanis said the county assumed ownership of the building last summer and chose these three specific nonprofit organizations to best serve community needs.</p>\n<p>­“There was a lot of community support for the county to retain ownership of the building,” Chanis said. “Based on that, the county is really working on having the building be a community asset.”</p>\n<p>According to the Board of Supervisors’ proposal for the clinic renovations, the Regents will lease space to set up offices for a variety of campus mental health services available to students and I.V. residents. Resources will include Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.), Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) and Student Mental Health Coordination Services (SMHCS).</p>\n<p>Third-year literature and sociology major and former C.A.R.E. student staff member Emily Potter said expanding C.A.R.E.’s services in I.V. will be beneficial to non-students seeking support.</p>\n<p>“I think it will be excellent for the community to have a space like CARE in Isla Vista,” Potter said in an email. “CARE’s services are not just limited to UCSB students so I’m really excited at the possibility that the additional location will let students from SBCC and other community members with a need for advocacy resources to feel they have better access to them.”</p>\n<p>Potter said the community will benefit greatly from the renovation of these spaces, as this means there will be room for the expansion of mental health services in I.V.</p>\n<p>“It will allow services like CARE to expand because of the additional space and I think there is a great need for that, so the opportunity for the growth of the program is great too,” Potter said in email.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Youth Projects Inc. Fiscal Manager and Board Member Arthur Kennedy said the leased office space will be used for the organization’s administrative needs, though they are also considering incorporating other services such as a weekly family resource center.</p>\n<p>“We need the space, because we only have about four office workers in our Goleta office,” Kennedy said. “But we are considering having a weekly family resource center availability within these offices as well as other services.”</p>\n<p>According to Chanis, renovations are underway and tenants are expected to move into the office spaces in July.</p>\n<p>“We’re finishing up the exterior stairwell, and are nearly completed with the roof,” Chanis said. “So the interior and exterior are undergoing renovations that should open up the space for the tenants.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said while the I.V. Clinic renovations will provide necessary services, she plans to develop a community center in the building adjacent to the clinic that formerly housed the Saint Athanasius church.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the space that we want as a community center — we are still looking for the moment to do that at the rehabilitation of a former church building,” Farr said. “The tenants should be meeting this summer at the new fiscal year and then I’m turning my attention to rehabilitating the church to turn into a community center.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of teh Thursday May 14, 2015

conditions given California Governor Jerry Brown’s state-mandated water restrictions issued earlier this month.</p>\n<p>State regulators discussed Brown’s water reduction rules this past Saturday, which cut urban potable water use by 25 percent statewide. According to a California State Water Boards press release, on March 17 the State Water Resources Control Board adopted emergency regulations that apply to all California residents, prohibiting runoff irrigation to non-irrigated areas, driveway and sidewalk washing and hose use without shutoff nozzles to wash vehicles. In addition, restaurants and other food service establishments have been mandated to only serve water to customers on request.</p>\n<p>UCSB Sustainability Recycling and Water Efficiency manager Matthew O’Carroll said the Goleta Water District has robust water conservation programs and relatively low per-capita water use in comparison to other water districts. According to O’Carroll, further water reductions at the university will require higher expenditures.</p>\n<p>“UCSB’s biggest challenge is achieving further potable water reductions,” O’Carroll said in an email. “Just last year, we reduced our potable water consumption 21% compared to the previous year and we are at a point now where we have picked a lot of the ‘low-hanging fruit.’ So future strategies that yield significant potable water savings will also have large upfront costs.”</p>\n<p>According to O’Carroll, while reduction in potable water consumption is a top priority, water conservation for landscape maintenance is less of a priority due to the university’s use of recycled water.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is fortunate enough to have recycled water, a source of water that is of lesser quality than potable/drinking water, but which can be used for certain applications such as irrigation,” O’Carroll said. “Ninety percent of our campus is irrigated with recycled water, and to be honest, if we didn’t have this source, landscape and irrigation could possibly be our largest area of potable water consumption.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks Department (IVRPD) general manager Rodney Gould said that while recycled water is beneficial to the university in water conservation, it is inaccessible in Isla Vista due to lack of funds.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately the distribution lines for recycled water stop at UCSB and don’t reach Isla Vista,” Gould said. “We asked Goleta Water District if they would extend the pipes but they indicated they don’t have the funds to do so. If we can find the funding for the infrastructure, they would provide the water.”</p>\n<p>According to Gould, while IVRPD has made significant cuts in water consumption in the past few years, more conservation efforts will be necessary with potentially increasing rates based on a Stage 3 surcharge.</p>\n<p>“With proposed changes in Goleta Water District’s billing structure, the District could potentially experience a $38,000 annual rate increase,” Gould said. “We’ve been watching our water usage very carefully and on average have cut back by 25 percent as compared to the 2012-2013 fiscal year. We’re also in the process of auditing the irrigation in all of our parks looking for leaks, and calculating usage in specific areas.”</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Food Co-op produce manager Rebekah Miles said local produce suppliers have been hit the hardest, while the Co-op itself has not been greatly affected by the water shortages.<br>\n“For example, we usually have a constant supply of local avocados, but this is the first time in the four-and-a-half years I’ve been here that we’ve had a three month gap in avocado supply,” Miles said.</p>\n<p>Miles also said in addition to water shortage, farmers have been dealing with various pests that are especially prevalent during droughts, such as the bagrada bug that feasts on brassica, a certain leafy green produce.</p>\n<p>“Brassicas include cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower and various other leafy greens, all of which we carry at the Co-op,” Miles said. “Organics do not use pesticides, so these bugs are really causing problems especially in dry conditions.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said members of the UCSB Bren School formed the Water Action Plan in 2013 after the university surpassed the 20 percent potable water use reduction goal by 2020 mandated by UC Office of the President. According to O’Carroll, developing the Water Action Plan helped identify the major consumers of potable water on campus, which are bathrooms and labs, primarily in academic buildings and residence halls.</p>\n<p>“The majority of our potable water consumption is in academic buildings and in residential housing,” O’Carroll said. “In academic buildings we are looking at more efficient water fixtures in both bathrooms and the lab setting.”</p>\n<p>O’Carroll said in addition to short-term modifications to conserve water, such as bathroom retrofitting, educational campaigns are also a part of Housing and Residential Services water conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>“Housing and Residential Services has continued their commitment to conserving water and has continued to outfit the residence halls with efficient fixtures and also have a very robust education and outreach program,” O’Carroll said.</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) co-chairs third-year biology major Heather Vest and third-year environmental studies major Jennifer Suh said in a joint statement that changing personal eating habits is one of the most difficult parts about conserving water.</p>\n<p>“One method to reduce is cutting down on water-intensive food choices such as almonds, meat and walnuts, which use a hearty supply of water to produce,” Vest and Suh said in an email. “So much of California’s water usage is agricultural, so it’s important to consume less.”</p>\n<p>According to Vest and Suh, water conservation is most significant at the individual level.</p>\n<p>“As students at UCSB, we often find it difficult to see any effects on our lives personally because with the ways we live, we don’t pay for our water sources within campus and/or Isla Vista housing, so many students do not see the need to decrease our water usage,” Vest and Suh said. “But we need to make choices every day that show we are conscious of the situation.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

his involvement in the 2011 Egyptian Revolution and the organization of social protests that led up to it in 3824 Ellison Hall today at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p>The lecture, entitled “The Inside Story of the Egypt Revolution,” will be hosted by the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center Research Focus Group and sponsored by the Center for Middle East Studies and the Department of Political Science. Shehata is currently the Vice Chairman and Programs Director of the Sadat Association for Development and Social Welfare, and specializes in research on youth mobilization through social media, Al-Qaeda ideology and conflict lines between Christianity and Islam.</p>\n<p>Political Science professor Cynthia Kaplan said she met Shehata in Berlin during the fall of the Berlin Wall and at that time invited him to speak. Shehata holds a first-hand account of what it was like to be on the ground during the Egyptian protests during 2011, according to Kaplan.</p>\n<p>“He is a rather remarkable informant on those events and consequences,” Kaplan said. “It is a wonderful opportunity to hear a perspective from below from someone who was a participant.”</p>\n<p>According to a brief biography written by Shehata for the lecture, he is currently working on human rights issues in Egypt, including “peaceful demonstrations, freedom of opinion, expression and information, and housing rights.”</p>\n<p>Kaplan said aspects of Shehata’s lecture that will be particularly appealing to student audiences involve his extensive involvement in youth mobilization during the revolution.</p>\n<p>“He was essential in organizing youth participation during the events of the Egyptian Revolution and still is,” Kaplan said. “So this idea of social mobilization is very interesting for those who are interested in social movements in general.”</p>\n<p>According to Kaplan, Shehata participated in key negotiations between activists and members of the military and can offer additional unique perspectives to conventional academic studies on the revolution.</p>\n<p>“He took part in roundtables with elites and military members, so his perspective is rather refreshing in that he provides insights that a more academic, distanced study cannot,” Kaplan said.</p>\n<p>First-year communications major Ruben Rodriguez said he is interested in the fall of governments and ruling elites, and looks forward to attending the talk.</p>\n<p>“A lot of governments recently have been overthrown through civil protest, so it’ll be interesting to see [Shehata’s] account of protests in Cairo during 2011,” Rodriguez said.</p>\n<p>According to first-year economics and accounting major Nicholas Lynch, his Middle Eastern Studies class this past Fall Quarter peaked his interest in the Egyptian Revolution.</p>\n<p>“The Middle East is still in flux and it would be interesting to not only hear his accounts of the revolution in 2011, but also hear what he has to say about the future state of many other countries in turmoil,” Lynch said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of the Thursday, April 9 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The task force also released a list of demands on Wednesday, calling for “the demilitarization of police at major events such as Halloween and Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Anonymous members of the Task Force said in an email the protest and list of demands were aimed at resisting the increase of over-policing, militant practices and profit-based ticketing in I.V. and on campus.</p>\n<p>“We came across the page ‘Keep Isla Vista Safe.’ This page proclaims to operate as a community effort to maintain order and safety throughout the streets of Isla Vista,”<br>\nthe members said in an email. “Instead, this campaign boastingly intimidates students with memes regarding the increase of profitable restrictions and police presence.”</p>\n<p>According to Task Force members, student demonstrations and demands have been presented to university administration in order to bring attention to the relationship between increased police presence and tension between students, I.V. residents and authority figures.</p>\n<p>“When students see so many police officers swarming the streets of Isla Vista, walking around with their hands on their guns, it creates a hostile environment that makes students feel unsafe and defensive, as though they have already been profiled as criminals,” members said in an email. “This atmosphere is what produces unfortunate events like the riot that occurred during Deltopia last year.”</p>\n<p>The Task Force’s demands call for “redirection of funds from tickets into restorative programs and educational safety courses” and insist “all law enforcement officers participate in a required cultural competency and diversity training,” aimed to educate officers “on the emotional, social and psychological effects of police presence experienced by students of color and other marginalized groups.”</p>\n<p>Demonstrators in the Arbor wore black and placed duct tape over their mouths, asking passing students to sign a “stop over-policing” petition directed toward Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Members also called for students to participate in a photo project called “300+,” in which students wrote one descriptive word about their reaction to the planned presence of over 300 police officers in I.V. for Deltopia weekend.</p>\n<p>“Students have expressed that Isla Vista policing makes them feel threatened, triggered, targeted, criminalized, nervous, unsafe, uncomfortable, and exploited,” the members said in an email. “We believe that the photos and expressions from the community highlight the general consensus from students and I.V. residents that large numbers of police do not make them feel protected or safe, but rather the opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to first-year global studies major Ogui González Vilá, the increase of ordinances and restrictions during Deltopia weekend alienate students from police.</p>\n<p>“I wish that there was just more collaboration between students and police in events like these,” Vilá said. “I know there are other alternatives to discourage people from attending Deltopia other than using police scare tactics.”</p>\n<p>The Task Force on Police Brutality finally stated that their demands be “implemented within the next 3-6 months,” with Yang’s official response expected “no later than 5 p.m. on April 8th 2015.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 the Thursday, April 2, 2015 print edition.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The research has taken place in several academic subjects including sociology and communication over the course of 11 total lectures.</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year electrical engineering major and A.S. controller Amir Khazaieli, research is still in its experimental stage but the goal of A.S. is to eventually offer a medium that would allow one to become more engaged with their lectures.</p>\n<p>“This is a very, very extensive project that has been in the works for over a year,” Khazaieli said. “Half of it is just providing new tools in lecture to gather information. The other half of it is to provide an interface for students to be able to collaboratively edit and review this information.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said while the Google Doc program is still in its “inception” phase, the program offers a wide variety of benefits to students.</p>\n<p>“The notes that come out of this kind of situation have proven to be a lot more complete, in the sense that a lot more thought-driven analysis goes into what they’re [students are] hearing rather than trying to frantically copy and paste everything that’s said,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>However, classics professor Helen Morales said she prohibits A.S. from passing out flyers promoting the program outside her Greek Mythology lecture because the program allegedly violates UC policy on lecture material distribution.</p>\n<p>“In a nutshell, the A.S. shared note-taking initiative breaks UC Policy 102.23 which expressly forbids students from recording lectures or discussions and from distributing or selling lecture notes and all other course materials without the prior written permission of the instructor,” Morales said in an email.</p>\n<p>Morales said the initiative seemed a lot like <em>studysoup.com</em> and other online initiatives which sell lecture notes to students.</p>\n<p>“The bottom line for me is that students who use them don’t do as well as students who don’t use them,” Morales said. “It’s important to realize that the process of taking notes during lectures is as important as the notes themselves. … So I think that this initiative encourages students not to take their own notes.”</p>\n<p>According to Khazaieli however, the research A.S. is doing is legal and unlike other online note-sharing programs Morales mentioned.</p>\n<p>“I think some people are equating what we are doing with other services that get students to upload lecture slides, content and notes, which they sell to other people to make money,” Khazaieli said. “This is not what is being done at all.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli said the note-taking program would only allow access codes within the course to access the document if the program is introduced as an option for lecture attendees.“In order to access the Google Doc you need to get the unique link that we would pass out as you’re walking into class, so it ensures you have to be in class to first access the Google Doc, and then it’s taken down afterwards,” Khazaieli said. “It would also be moderated, so anybody who is not actively participating will be kicked off. So it’s not like you can access it and not take notes.”</p>\n<p>Khazaieli also said the note-taking program’s collaborative nature is not breaking UC policy because it will give all students an equal opportunity to contribute to the Google Doc.</p>\n<p>“We would not be taking lecture content and lecture slides,” Khazaieli said. “Its student’s interpretations and what they’ve heard. The only difference between this and taking paper notes is that this is online.”</p>\n<p>According to Khazaieli, the A.S. Office of the Controller is in the process of finding the best way to implement the program to make it as easily accessible and function as possible.</p>\n<p>“It’s been about doing more controlled research tests to figure out how to tune the cogs and the wheels so that when the final product comes out it’s something that everybody loves and can use effectively,” Khazaieli said.</p>\n<p>First-year economics major Brian Lee said he would be open to any type of effort by A.S. to make information gathering in classrooms more collaborative, but said he would not use the technology himself.</p>\n<p>“I think something like this would be useful for studying because other people could clarify ideas from lecture,” Lee said. “I don’t think I would use it because I feel like I get a better understanding of material by putting it in my own words.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61385\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/new-note-taking-tool-in-the-works/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61385\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/new-note-taking-tool-in-the-works/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/new-note-taking-tool-in-the-works/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/new-note-taking-tool-in-the-works/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-26/new-note-taking-tool-in-the-works/","id":2854,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2853,2852,2851],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

First Friday planners were initially organizing a larger-than-average version of the event with multiple stages but ran into issues once Santa Barbara County approved noise ordinances during the first two weekends of April in order to prevent this year’s Deltopia from becoming disorderly. I.V. First Friday is coordinated by I.V. Open Lab, a project-based course offered by the university’s Interdisciplinary Humanities Center and sponsored by the I.V. Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) and the I.V. Food Co-Op. The event is hosted as a late-night alternative to what many students call the “I.V. party scene,” and is held the first Friday of every month at Perfect Park, featuring live local music, artwork, improvisation and dance performances and more.</p>\n<p>According to IVRPD General Manager Rodney Gould, the original plan for the First Friday on April 3 was to have a number of groups and organizations co-host a block party that would have been larger than most First Fridays to date.</p>\n<p>“We were actually considering fencing off the entire end of the loop and having multiple stages with varying forms of entertainment operating simultaneously,” Gould said in an email. “Before we got very far into the planning, we realized we couldn’t proceed due to the festival ordinance that was put into place for Deltopia.”</p>\n<p>Gould said the original proposal for I.V. First Friday was suggested in anticipation of the influx of people expected to come to I.V. during Deltopia weekend, which attracted an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 partygoers in last April. </p>\n<p>“We figured that there would be a lot of people in town that night,” Gould said in an email. “The University has planned a lot of things Saturday as alternatives, but there was nothing on Friday, so we thought this might take some of the burden off the Del Playa partying.”</p>\n<p>Gould said I.V. Open Lab is now exploring the possibility of having an art show in the early evening of April 3 at the I.V. Clinic building that would feature I.V.’s “hidden art community.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot of resident artists in Isla Vista that people just don’t know about that have been here for years, so we thought it would be kind of fun to showcase that,” Gould said.</p>\n<p>I.V. Open Lab instructor and spatial art professor Kim Yasuda said the students of I.V. Open Lab are also discussing organizing a silent movie series and a silent disco, though the plans for the First Friday to be held on April 3 are still dependent on approval from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to figure out a mellow, outdoor lounge-like event for that Friday,” Yasuda said. “We also want it to be local, so that’s why we’re showcasing the resident artists’ artwork. The visual display is quiet, the disco is quiet and then we thought about silent movies.”</p>\n<p>Second-year English major and I.V. Open Lab student Itxy Quintanilla said it was disappointing to learn the initial plans for the First Friday on April 3 could not be executed.</p>\n<p>“We are saving those plans for a future month,” Quintanilla said in an email. “We understand the reason for the implementation of these ordinances, but it has been difficult to work around them.”</p>\n<p>Quintanilla said she is hopeful the newly proposed events will be approved by Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.</p>\n<p>“After throwing around several ideas and discussing the ordinances, we hope that our movie in the park proposal will meet the guidelines and provide a safe and engaging community gathering,” Quintanilla said in an email. “Hopefully our plans are approved in order to create another successful event.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda said the collaboration between students, faculty, residents and local businesses is what makes First Fridays special, and she hopes the First Friday scheduled for the night of April 3 can still take place.</p>\n<p>“We want it to happen and we think it’s going to be great and attract the right kind of people,” Yasuda said. “We feel it is really important to have programming that is creative, safe and alternative, because if you have nothing, then that’s when the trouble starts.” Yasuda said.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61272\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61272\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-23/i-v-first-friday-planners-attempt-to-work-around-noise-ordinance/","id":4739,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[4738,4737,4736],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dept. of Sociology To Celebrate 50 Years of Grad Program","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sociology_Stephen-Manga.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sociology_Stephen-Manga.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Department of Sociology will host a research conference this Friday and Saturday to celebrate the graduate program’s 50th anniversary.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Department of Sociology will host a research conference this Friday and Saturday to celebrate the graduate program’s 50th anniversary.</p>\n<p>The two-day conference will be held in the Corwin Pavilion on Friday and at the Mosher Alumni House on Saturday and will feature a number of speakers and research presentations from universities across the country, including an introduction by Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The department was recently ranked number one in the country by the online database College Factual ranking last month.</p>\n<p>Sociology Department chair and professor Maria Charles said the conference is aimed at celebrating the milestone while also reflecting upon the department’s work in the field.</p>\n<p>“Our Ph.D. program was founded in the 1964-65 academic year, so one reason is to celebrate the major milestone, and the other reason is to consider UCSB’s Department of Sociology’s intellectual contributions, particularly looking at fields in which we have had [an] intellectual role in over the years,” Charles said.</p>\n<p>According to the conference’s program, topics that will be presented include but are not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, culture, globalization, ethnography, conversation analysis and social movements. Charles said she is excited to see the presentations on issues that have significant implications for society.</p>\n<p>“The speakers will be reflecting on the development of certain sociological subfields over the past 50 years,” Charles said. “We’re also looking at the impact of the department in terms of contributions to broader social good, because our faculty is very interested in doing research that is socially relevant and that address important social problems of today.”</p>\n<p>According to Charles, 10 former department chairs will be attending the event in addition to current sociology professors. Sociology graduate student Corrie Ellis said she decided to help coordinate the event and bring back former faculty for the opportunity to meet past faculty and department chairs and reflect on the history of the department.</p>\n<p>“I really got to know and interview some of the sociology faculty that has made UCSB sociology what it is today,” Ellis said. “It’s a special opportunity for all of us and especially graduate students to learn about the history of UCSB sociology, which I think is a very radical history and I’m very proud to be part of it.”</p>\n<p>According to Ellis, after talking to former faculty and chairs, she and another graduate student developed a timeline of faculty and chairs that will be displayed at the conference.</p>\n<p>UCLA sociology professor Steven Clayman, who received his Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology, said he is excited for the graduate program and looks forward to commemorating his alma mater.</p>\n<p>“I’m very proud to have come from that world-class program and it’s really great that they are now reaching their 50th anniversary,” Clayman said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Community Relations Committee. <em>Daily Nexus File Photo.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Isla Vista Community Relations Committee (IVCRC) will host its first-ever Isla Vista Week from Monday through Friday to educate students and community members about I.V.’s history and issues involving I.V. environment, housing, community and more.</p>\n<p>The event series will begin Monday afternoon with an on-foot tour of I.V. led by IVCRC and will end Friday night with I.V. First Friday, an entertainment event typically held on the first Friday of each month of the academic year. Other events include an environment and sustainability presentation by A.S. Recycling on Tuesday, a family craft and community art project on Wednesday and a student housing forum hosted by the Isla Vista Housing Coalition on Thursday.</p>\n<p>IVCRC external chair and fourth-year political science major Daniela Bayon said the events are aimed at building a community that cares about prominent issues currently surrounding I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to bring students, families and community members together through a variety of different relationships, events, and programs,” Bayon said.</p>\n<p>According to Bayon, IVCRC wants to expand their community involvement beyond their annual Pardall Carnival and Chilla Vista events, which are held annually in Fall and Spring quarters respectively.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I do believe there is a housing crisis in Isla Vista. I was one of the many students who had to couch surf this past fall, and unfortunately, this is not new to Isla Vista. It has been going on for many years where students are desperate for housing, families get evicted, and rent prices skyrocket. – Alejandra Melgoza, Isla Vista Housing Coalition organizer and second-year Chicana/o studies and history of public policy major</p></blockquote>\n<p>“It became our goal as a committee to do more, and to really focus on issue-based activism,” Bayon said. “It’s really come out of this concept to bring awareness to issues in Isla Vista and address them with community members who are already working on things.”</p>\n<p>Bayon said the housing forum is the start of IVCRC’s plan to eventually create a press release to be presented to university administration with a list of demands concerning what organizers call the current housing crisis in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We want to hear from the average student at UCSB that struggles with housing,” Bayon said. “A lot of the advisers on the Chancellor’s Housing Committee don’t grasp the idea that there is a housing crisis, so our goal is to raise awareness through this forum and the stories of some of these students to UCSB administration.”</p>\n<p>Alejandra Melgoza, Isla Vista Housing Coalition organizer and a second-year Chicana/o studies and history of public policy major, said the alleged housing crisis in I.V. is a prevalent issue facing all students living off-campus.</p>\n<p>“I do believe there is a housing crisis in Isla Vista,” Melgoza said in an email. “I was one of the many students who had to couch surf this past fall, and unfortunately, this is not new to Isla Vista. It has been going on for many years where students are desperate for housing, families get evicted, and rent prices skyrocket.”</p>\n<p>Melgoza said she hopes the Thursday forum at the Pardall Center will allow students to share their personal experiences with housing in I.V. and prompt collective action toward addressing housing issues.</p>\n<p>“It will be an open dialogue in which any issues may be brought up,” Melgoza said in an email. “I hope that with our collected efforts we can find a solution to give students and families affordable housing, knowledge on their rights as tenants, and put a stop to evictions.”</p>\n<p>Second-year English major Julia Swensen, who will be attending I.V. Week, said she is confident IVCRC will succeed in improving the I.V. community through this week’s series of events.</p>\n<p>“I’ve really liked the past events that IVCRC has put on, and they’ve done a good job of educating the community about the things we don’t know about Isla Vista,” Swensen said.</p>\n<p>Bayon said that she hopes this is the first of many such events to continue the process of building community relationships in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We just really want to build the sense of community that cares about each other through these resources and networks, especially in light of what happened last spring on May 23rd, I think the community is looking for a healing project … something new we can build together to contribute to Isla Vista,” Bayon said.</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly named Daniela Bayon IVCRC special events coordinator.

The week will conclude with the Afrikan Black Coalition Conference at UC Irvine, an annual gathering black students from across the state aiming to build leadership skills among students over the weekend.</p>\n<p>According to BSU outreach chair and third-year sociology and black studies major Jamelia Harris, the week not only aims to educate students about prevalent issues related to police brutality and racism, but is also meant to encourage students to take action through strategy building and development.</p>\n<p>“Our main goals are to raise community consciousness, develop strategies to enforce police accountability, develop a task force on police brutality, and create productive spaces where we can continue this dialogue and share ideas and visions with one another,” Harris said in an email. “It’s about inspiring developing leaders to emerge.”</p>\n<p>The week began on Monday with English professor Felice Blake facilitating a workshop on individual rights and was followed by a lecture on Tuesday by black studies and sociology professor George Lipsitz, who spoke about “education as a tool for dismantling systems of oppression.”</p>\n<p>According to Lipsitz, BSU’s week of education and action is an illustration of students’ desire to instigate change in the local and national political climate.</p>\n<p>“It shows that intelligent young people don’t want to be passive spectators to what is happening in this world,” Lipsitz said. “It is extremely encouraging for me to see these students engaging in self-education and activism that is designed to know about the world but also to change it.”</p>\n<p>Lipsitz also said BSU’s grassroots mobilization is a vital part of prompting societal change, especially in light of recent events regarding police brutality that have put issues of race in the national spotlight.</p>\n<p>“We spend a lot of time looking for leaders,” Lipsitz said. “But we can solve our own problems. Nobody is going to do for us what we fail to do for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>According to Harris, the involvement of Blake and Lipsitz in the week of events is crucial for the continuation of the Black Lives Matter movement, a black rights movement ongoing since the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 and amplified by the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner last year.</p>\n<p>“Dr. George Lipsitz has been called to serve and guest speak in Ferguson following the non-indictments, and Dr. Felice Blake holds a significant position in the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and has devoted much of her work to servicing marginalized communities,” Harris said in an email. “We’re blessed to have faculty members who have demonstrated their commitment to progression within the Black community through several avenues.”</p>\n<p>According to Harris, police brutality against citizens occurs both nationally and locally, including in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“SB is not innocent or estranged from the poisons of police brutality,” Harris said in an email. “In 2013, the amount of deaths caused by SBPD was double that of deaths caused by civilian murders.”</p>\n<p>However, Santa Barbara Police Department Sgt. Riley Harwood said the statistic is not valid and cannot be linked to police brutality.</p>\n<p>“In 2013 we had two officer-involved shootings, one of which the suspect was killed,” Harwood said. “In 2013 we had more people killed in vehicular homicides than officer-involved shootings, so I don’t really know where that [statistic] is coming from.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year global studies major and BSU member Harper Howell, the topics discussed during the week allow students like her to question the role of law enforcement in American culture.</p>\n<p>“It’s not the fact that all police are bad people, it’s just we need to question the way that they are being taught,” Howell said. “So that’s something as a nation we need to start getting involved in, and I’m glad we’re doing it here.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, January 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59763\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/bsu-holds-weeklong-event/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59763\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/bsu-holds-weeklong-event/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/bsu-holds-weeklong-event/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/bsu-holds-weeklong-event/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/bsu-holds-weeklong-event/","id":2976,"author":{"id":146,"name":"Danny Kolosta"},"related":[2975,2974,2973],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/146"}},"__N_SSG":true}
