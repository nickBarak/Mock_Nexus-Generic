I was pretty stumped on what to write about and how to write it. In the past when I didn’t know what to write on, I’d choose something that I am very passionate about, usually in-depth baseball articles. However, I thought that my last article required a broader topic with a little bit more of a grandiose style. So I was thinking about trying to incorporate my graduation, and subsequent departure from UCSB, into an article about sports. So here it is.</p>\n<p>Last week I wrote an article on the New York Yankees’ closer Mariano Rivera. I discussed his announcement that he will retire after this season, and that he leads the American League with 18 saves at the age of 43. That article made me realize that I’m at a point in my life where I am seeing the turnover from one sports generation to the next. Very soon the days of Kobe Bryant, Peyton Manning, Derek Jeter, Tom Brady, Kevin Garnett and Mariano Rivera, among so many others, will be gone.</p>\n<p>If I were younger when I realized that the sports generation that I grew up idolizing was leaving, I would have been devastated. I would have resisted such a monumental change to my world. I would have found myself desperately holding on to all of the observations, beliefs and feelings on players, teams and strategies that I had just witnessed retire. Then I finally realized that these observations, beliefs and feelings were outdated. My fantasy league rosters, sports video game performance and everyday sports arguments were slowly withering. I can’t watch and form intelligent opinions on today’s sports with the same observations, beliefs and feelings that I have gathered from the previous generation.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So here is the epiphany. The reason why I love sports and why they are truly genuine is because sport and competition is progress. Humans are imperfect, so we love to see the pursuit toward it. We are attracted to perfection. Sport and competition is the constant struggle for perfection — the struggle to beat everyone and to be on top. The sports world is run by the Goliath dynasties who write the history books through their success, but it is the underdog that we need. The underdog is the progress, the player/team/idea that upsets the status quo and keeps the sports world going. I have learned to embrace the new and young with the knowledge of our past. Don’t try to maintain success or become complacent; always get better because everyday there is an underdog working to beat you.</p>\n<p>So in light of graduation, don’t fear or be saddened by leaving UCSB; keep it alive and build on your experience. Don’t be complacent with the thought that UCSB was the lone high point in your life and everything is downhill from here. Live for the pursuit, and for the good times yet to come. Don’t be sad it’s over. Be happy it happened. If we can do that, we can give leaving UCSB, Isla Vista, our new friends and all of our memories a purpose.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kenneth Song of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51601\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51601\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/nexus-staff-writers-say-their-goodbyes-2/","id":3214,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3213,3212,3211],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Water Polo Reloads With Six New Recruits","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MWaterpolo_Courtesy-UCSB-Athletics.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MWaterpolo_Courtesy-UCSB-Athletics.jpg?resize=607%2C404&ssl=1","description":"The UC Santa Barbara men’s water polo team has six recruits lined up to bring some depth to a roster that rose to No. 2 in the national rankings during the 2012 season but finished 2-8 in their fina...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UC Santa Barbara men’s water polo team has six recruits lined up to bring some depth to a roster that rose to No. 2 in the national rankings during the 2012 season but finished 2-8 in their final 10 games.</p>\n<p>“When we are recruiting, we look for players who address our current needs, and any players who can come in to our program and compete right away,” Assistant Coach John Abdou said. “We watch the players at their high school games, but we really study them on their club teams.

Playing for a good club team shows us that they are committed to their sport year-round and want to move on to the collegiate ranks.”</p>\n<p>The Gaucho recruiting process is still ongoing, but they have already locked up Nick Wiley, Anthony Buljan, Tyler Martin, Andrew Judge, Kyle Garwick and Alden Geller.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Wiley is a graduate of Coronado High School in San Diego, where he was a standout performer and a First Team All-San Diego selection in his senior season.</p>\n<p>“Wiley is an attacker and is a great playmaker from what we have seen so far,” Abdou said. “We are excited to have him aboard.”</p>\n<p>Buljan is coming to UCSB by way of Serra High School in San Mateo, California. In his senior season, Buljan compiled 121 goals, 34 assists and 43 steals in 28 games played.</p>\n<p>“Buljan is a center, and we think he has a lot of potential to develop into a formidable player at the collegiate level,” Abdou said.</p>\n<p>Martin is an attacker from San Ramon High School, where he helped the Wolves reach the North Coast Section Division I title game in consecutive seasons. In his senior season, Martin notched 57 goals and 117 steals on his way to earning the East Bay Athletic League MVP award.</p>\n<p>“Martin is a very fast swimmer and a great athlete,” Abdou said. “We really like him on defense.”</p>\n<p>Andrew Judge is an interesting case because he will be coming to the Gauchos all the way from New York, which is not normally known for its water polo.</p>\n<p>“We saw Judge play for the S.E.T. Water Polo Club in Orange County over the summer, and Head Coach Wolf Wigo is also from New York, so we have done our homework on this guy,” Abdou said.</p>\n<p>Garwick is a 6’5” goalie hailing from Damien High School in La Verne, California. During his high school and club career, Garwick earned numerous awards including First Team All-Sierra League in 2010, 2011, 2012, First Team All-CIF in 2011, 2012 and the 2012 San Gabriel Valley Player of the Year award.</p>\n<p>“Garwick played for one of the top club teams in Southern California, and he has great size for a goalie,” Abdou said. “Our starting goalie, Myles Christian, is graduating this year, and we really like freshman goalie Chris Whitelegge, so Garwick adds some nice depth to our team and we expect him to compete right away.”</p>\n<p>Last but not least, Geller is coming to UCSB as a graduate of La Canada High School in California. Geller’s strong senior season that featured 77 goals and 42 steals earned him a First Team All-Rio Hondo League selection.</p>\n<p>“We really like his size at 6’4”, and the fact that he’s left handed,” Abdou said. “He’s a well-rounded player, and we expect him to do a lot of good things for us in the future.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to next season, the Gauchos will be without five key players from the 2012 roster. Seniors Brian Shoemaker and Myles Christian will be graduating, and Dylan Baliani, Ted Zhang and Evan Dellinger will no longer play with the team. However, one thing is for certain: The future of Gaucho water polo looks bright with these new recruits and the young stars already on the roster.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of UCSB Athletics.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51547\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/water-polo-reloads-with-six-new-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51547\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/water-polo-reloads-with-six-new-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/water-polo-reloads-with-six-new-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/water-polo-reloads-with-six-new-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/water-polo-reloads-with-six-new-recruits/","id":5123,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[5122,5121,5120],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mariano Rivera Proving To Excel Despite Age","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"When Yankees manager Joe Girardi is preparing for bed at the end of the night, he makes a phone call to one of his employees to prepare a fine bottle of wine.

It is always the same bottle; it has one taste and only one taste. Yet this taste is the greatest in history, and it has gotten better with age. As you may have guessed, I am not actually talking about wine. I am bringing up the striking comparison between Yankees closer Mariano Rivera and a fine bottle of wine.</p>\n<p>Girardi’s bottle of wine’s unique taste is actually Rivera’s only pitch: his dominating cutter. The bottle of wine’s greatest taste in history refers to the fact that Rivera is the all-time save leader with 624. Rivera has also gotten better with age. After tearing his ACL shagging fly balls in batting practice last season, Rivera is a perfect 16 for 16 in save opportunities this season at the age of 43.</p>\n<p>The Yankees are holding down first place in the AL East despite the injuries to Derek Jeter, Curtis Granderson, Mark Teixeira, and Alex Rodriguez. What is holding them afloat is surely Rivera’s dominance and the resurgence of castoffs like Travis Hafner, Vernon Wells, and Kevin Youkilis. Unfortunately, Rivera announced in March that he will be retiring after this season. Rivera’s retirement, Jeter’s lengthy disabled list stint and the retirement of longtime catcher Jorge Posada mean we are seeing the end of an era in New York.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This season has become Rivera’s farewell tour, just as last year was Chipper Jones’s. Rivera will certainly be on the American League All-Star team this season, but this year’s game might have a twist. There is a movement circulating the baseball world to make Rivera the starting pitcher of this year’s game. We have seen such honorable gestures at the midsummer classic before. You might remember in the 2001 game, Alex Rodriguez moved over to third base to allow Cal Ripken Jr. to return to short stop. Ripken played short stop for most of his career, and Rodriguez’s gesture was a nice touch in Ripken’s final season.</p>\n<p>However, I am against starting Rivera. Pitchers, and especially closers, are creatures of habit. Starting Rivera would most likely affect his performance. It would be a shame to see him struggle on national TV, and it could also affect his mindset when he returns to the Yankees bullpen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>The Angels and Blue Jays spent a lot of money in the offseason and are struggling mightily. The Angels are 11-20, and we have learned that the days of small ball and a great bullpen are long forgotten. They have stolen only 12 bases so far and have a 9:1 strikeout to home run ratio. Josh Hamilton is hitting .208 with two home runs. Then there are their pitching woes. The Angels are second to last in the league in team ERA (4.78) and sixth to last in batting average against (.265). The takeaway: Manager Mike Scioscia is in the hot seat.</p>\n<p>Before the season, many experts had the Blue Jays winning the AL East because they acquired R.A. Dickey, Jose Reyes, Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle and Melky Cabrera. Now, Toronto is 11-21 with Reyes and Johnson hurt and Cabrera, Buehrle and Dickey all struggling. The takeaway: Don’t sign players who were suspended for steroids a season ago or trade for 38-year-old knuckleballers and injury-plagued starting pitchers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>League Wide Strikeouts</p>\n<p>The league-wide strikeout rates are entering unprecedented territory. This past April featured the second-highest strikeout per game total for a single month in MLB history at 15.29 hitters per game. It wasn’t just April either, the top eight highest strikeout per game totals for a month have come in the last eight months of play. That’s right — the last eight months of play are the top eight months for strikeout per game totals in MLB history. The month that holds the top spot is September 2012, when an average of 15.47 hitters struck out per game.</p>\n<p>Many hitters will point to April’s cold, bad-for-hitting weather in many cities or the pitchers arm’s being fresher, but when this trend dates back to last season it is pretty safe to say that this is an on-going trend. So what is causing this? Twins catcher Joe Mauer has said recently that pitchers are developing deeper pitch repertoires since he came into the league ten years ago. It could also be that since the ousting of performance-enhancing drugs, hitters now have to try a lot harder to hit home runs leading to more whiffs and thus more strikeouts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yu Darvish Can Pitch</p>\n<p>This isn’t shocking news ­— ­­­­­­­­­­­we all already knew Darvish could pitch. However, what we didn’t know heading into the season is that Darvish has a chance to make history. After barely missing a no-hitter on April 2 against the Astros, Darvish is 5-1 with a 2.56 ERA, and opponents are hitting an abysmal .169 off of him. Here is the historic part: In his 45.2 innings pitched so far this season, he has accumulated 72 strikeouts. That’s about 14 strikeouts for every nine innings pitched, which means he is on pace to become the first pitcher since Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in 2002 to strikeout 300 batters in a season. If he keeps this up, Darvish could make history by becoming the first Japanese born pitcher to win the Cy Young.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>2013 is a new year for 2012 Cy Young Winners David Price and R.A. Dickey</p>\n<p>20-5, 2.56 ERA, 205 K’s — 20-6, 2.73 ERA, 230 K’s</p>\n<p>The numbers above reflect the final regular season stats of last season’s Cy Young award winners, David Price and R.A. Dickey respectively. Now, unfortunately, both of these quality pitchers are finding out that 2012 is no more. So far this season Price is 1-3 with a 6.25 ERA and 40 K’s in 44.2 innings. Dickey is 2-5 with a 5.36 ERA and only 33 K’s in 42 innings.</p>\n<p>These struggles will almost certainly end for Price because he has proven he can be consistently dominant in the competitive AL East. Furthermore, a guy who throws upper 90s with a plus slider and good command will not continue to get lit up like he has. As for Dickey, these struggles shouldn’t be that surprising. He is 38 years old and has won more than 10 games in a season only once before last year. Perhaps the injuries are causing the knuckleball not to knuckle, but his poor numbers could also be a result of moving out of the poor NL East and into the AL East. Now Dickey has to face the big hitting Red Sox, Yankees and Orioles multiple times a year instead of teams like the Marlins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The MLB is becoming a young man’s league</p>\n<p>We are seeing a dramatic drop-off in the number of players who are still productive into their late 30s. Gone are the days where guys like Barry Bonds were hitting 40 home runs annually in late 30s. Now the game is being dominated by young and freakishly athletic players like Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg and Clayton Kershaw.</p>\n<p>What has caused this trend? We don’t know. It could be the passing of the steroid era, which made players better for longer, or simply the manifestation of human evolution right before our eyes. What we do know is that players like Albert Pujols, Josh Hamilton, Alex Rodriguez, Roy Halladay and many other aging stars are not doing well at all. Instead, the players who are making headlines are barely out of their teenage years. In honor of this trend, here are the top 10 players who are 25 years old or younger and who are not named Trout, Harper, Kershaw or Strasburg.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Manny Machado, age: 20, 5 HRs, 21 RBIs, .309 BA. First in league among third basemen with .8 defensive wins above replacement, which measures production compared to the average player. Machado is being compared to Orioles Hall of Fame third basemen Brooks Robinson, who won a record sixteen consecutive gold gloves.</p>\n<p>Anthony Rizzo, age: 23, 8 HRs, 21 RBIs, .246 BA. Despite the low batting average, Rizzo still maintains a solid .331 on-base percentage, which speaks to his eye at the plate.</p>\n<p>Jose Fernandez, age: 20, 1-2, 3.48 ERA, 1.06 WHIP, 32 K’s. Fernandez is the fourth pitcher in the last 90 seasons under the age of 21 to throw seven or more scoreless innings with at least nine strikeouts and allow one hit or fewer.</p>\n<p>Elvis Andrus, age: 24, .246 BA, 10 RBIs, 6 stolen bases. Andrus’s superb defense and 129 career stolen bases are among the many reasons why the Rangers locked him up with an eight year, $120 million contract extension.</p>\n<p>Matt Moore, age: 23, 5-1, 1.95 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, 41 Ks. Moore has allowed only 20 hits in 37 innings pitched so far this season, which means … hope for a walk.</p>\n<p>Jose Altuve, age: 23, .331 BA, 15 RBIs, 1 HR. The only thing more impressive than Altuve’s batting average is that he is doing it at 5’5”, 173 pounds. The epitome of a baseball player.</p>\n<p>Jean Segura, age: 23, .333 BA, 4 HRs, 13 RBIs, 8 stolen bases. After coming over from the Angels in the Greinke trade last season, all Segura has done is hit, hit and hit some more.</p>\n<p>Will Middlebrooks, age: 24, .195 BA, 6 HRs, 12 RBIs. Don’t let his early season slump fool you; Middlebrooks was keeping up with Mike Trout last year before falling to injury. Middlebrooks will be a 30 home run guy for a long time in Boston.</p>\n<p>Chris Sale, age: 24, 3-2, 3.42 ERA, 1.10 WHIP, 42 K’s.

Instead of a selecting big time playmakers, the Chiefs and Jaguars selected offensive tackles Eric Fisher and Luke Joeckel with the first two overall picks.</p>\n<p>This draft marks the first time since 2008 that an offensive tackle was taken first overall, and the first time since 1970 that offensive tackles were taken with the first two picks. The madness didn’t stop there either. Out of the 32 picks in the first round, 18 were spent on either an offensive or defensive lineman. To top it all off, this draft was the first time a running back wasn’t taken in the first round since 1963.</p>\n<p>All of that was semi-expected. What was not foreseen was the Bills selection of Florida St. quarterback E.J. Manuel with the 16th overall pick. Many experts had West Virginia’s Geno Smith as the top rated quarterback, but the Bills and first year Head Coach Doug Marrone decided to go with Manuel. Marrone is coming to the Bills via Syracuse, where Ryan Nassib was his quarterback. There was a lot of speculation that the Bills would select Nassib and keep him with his college coach. However, the Bills ultimately decided to trade down from their original spot at number eight overall to 16th overall and select Manuel.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Those were some of the top story lines from the first round; here is a look at some of the draft classes for individual teams.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>San Francisco 49ers:</p>\n<p>The 49ers did not have any glaring needs heading into the draft. During the offseason, defensive tackle Isaac Sopoaga signed with the Eagles and safety Dashon Goldson signed with the Buccaneers. However, before the draft, the Niners added depth at those positions by signing safety Craig Dahl and former fifth overall pick and defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey. These replacements aren’t on the same level but they are certainly capable players.</p>\n<p>With their first three picks in the draft, the Niners went with safety Matt Elam, defensive end Cornellius “Tank” Carradine, and tight end Vance McDonald. Elam is coming out of the University of Florida where he proved he can impact the game with his coverage and tackling skills. McDonald fills the void left by back up tight end Delanie Walker’s departure. In the fourth round, the Niners selected South Carolina running back Marcus Lattimore. Lattimore was a perennial preseason Heisman candidate before tearing his ACL and dislocating his knee cap in consecutive seasons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>San Diego Chargers:</p>\n<p>The Chargers are in an awkward place as a team right now. Five or six years ago, the Chargers were one of the most talented teams in the league. Now it seems as though the rest of the league has gotten better, while the Chargers have let their roster wither. Now with a new general manager in Tom Telesco and first year Head Coach Mike McCoy at the reins, the Chargers are headed in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Entering the draft, the Chargers had obvious needs on the offensive line and at the wide receiver position. With their first three picks, San Diego took Alabama offensive tackle D.J. Fluker, Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o and Cal wide receiver Keenan Allen. The Chargers really nailed it with these picks. Fluker will start right away and will probably develop into a solid left tackle. Te’o was a projected first rounder but fell all the way to the Chargers at 38th overall. Look for all three of these picks to contribute right away in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Green Bay Packers:</p>\n<p>The Packers need to protect Aaron Rodgers, develop a better running game and shore up their aging defense. So what did they do? Drafted a beast of a defensive end from UCLA in Datone Jones, selected two offensive linemen and locked up two of the best running backs in the draft with Alabama’s Eddie Lacy and UCLA’s Johnathan Franklin. With these players and their other draft selections, the Packers did a beautiful job at filling the team’s needs. However, Green Bay does need to find an answer to the departures of defensive back Charles Woodson and wide receiver Greg Jennings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minnesota Vikings:</p>\n<p>The Vikings made the most out of their three first round picks. The Vikings needed help on defense and at the wide receiver position after the departure of wide receiver Percy Harvin. At 23rd overall, they drafted an absolute stud in defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd, who many projected to be a top-10 selection. Then they grabbed cornerback Xavier Rhodes out of Florida St. Rhodes is a physical player, who also possesses good ball skills. At 29th overall, Minnesota filled Harvin’s spot with Tennessee wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson. Patterson is 6’2”, 216 pounds and can jump out of stadium; however, he did only play one year of big time college football after transferring from the junior college ranks. Nonetheless, the Vikings are a much better team now with Patterson lining up with new acquisition Greg Jennings.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Philadelphia Eagles:</p>\n<p>After a few years of controversy and rumors, the Eagles finally parted ways with Head Coach Andy Reid after fourteen seasons. Now the man calling the shots is former Oregon Head Coach Chip Kelly. Kelly is thought of around football as an offensive genius who is going to try to bring his patented style of lightning quick offense to the NFL.</p>\n<p>With the fourth overall pick, the Eagles went with Oklahoma offensive tackle Lane Johnson. Johnson makes sense because he played in a similar quick tempo offense in college. Johnson is a freak athlete who converted to tackle after playing quarterback in high school. Philadelphia then went on to take Stanford tight end Zach Ertz who can do a lot of things on the offensive side of the ball. He is a tough, versatile athlete who will fit into Kelly’s offense nicely.</p>\n<p>With the first pick in the fourth round, the Eagles shocked a lot of people by drafting USC quarterback Matt Barkley. Barkley’s stock plummeted in his final year of college after he would have likely been a top-10 pick in the 2012 draft. Barkley’s arrival brings a lot of attention to the QB situation in Philadelphia. Is Michael Vick the right fit for Kelly’s spread offense? Or it could be either Nick Foles or Barkley, who are more pocket passers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oakland Raiders:</p>\n<p>The first five teams that I mentioned all had great drafts. The Oakland Raiders, unfortunately, did not. While the Raiders’ woeful roster management should come as no surprise, they just continue to baffle me.</p>\n<p>The Raiders ended up taking D.J. Hayden, a cornerback out of Houston, with the 12th overall pick. Hayden is a great story because he almost lost his life in college after a knee to the chest caused immense internal bleeding. But if you are the Raiders and you want to take a cornerback, how about just staying at the third overall pick and select Alabama’s Dee Milliner? Milliner is a player you can build your defense around, but instead the Raiders traded down to gamble on a player who may never play a down of professional football.</p>\n<p>So, with the 2013 NFL draft in the books we can all look forward to the Ravens-Broncos game on opening night, another New York Jets quarterback controversy and another year of Tony Romo playing quarterback for the Cowboys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1624917340\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51102\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51103\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/eric-fisher/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg?fit=486%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"486,560\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Eric Fisher\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg?fit=217%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher.jpg?fit=486%2C560&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51103\" alt=\"Eric Fisher\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eric-Fisher-216x250.jpg?resize=216%2C250\" width=\"216\" height=\"250\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 30, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Anna Xu of The Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51102\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51102\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-30/hits-and-misses-of-the-2013-nfl-draft/","id":3187,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3186,3185,3184],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Germany Taking Over Soccer","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/robert-lewandowski-gtrt.org_.jpg?resize=298%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/robert-lewandowski-gtrt.org_.jpg?resize=298%2C295&ssl=1","description":"The semi-final round of the UEFA Champion’s League is underway, and the two German teams are attempting a coup d’état of the Spanish soccer dominance.

Then, on Wednesday, Borussia Dortmund almost duplicated Bayern’s dominance with a 4-1 home win over Real Madrid.</p>\n<p>With his team trying to secure their third trip to the Champion’s League final in the last four years, Bayern’s Thomas M<em>ü</em>ller got the scoring started with a goal in the 25th minute and then added another in the 82nd minute. Attackers Mario Gomez and Arjen Robben added their names to the scorers sheet in the 49th and 73rd minutes, respectively. Barcelona, a four-time Champion’s League winner, was able to hold possession for 63 percent of the game but could only muster two shot attempts on target. On the other hand, Bayern had nine shot attempts on target and eleven corner kicks.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The good news, if there is any, for Barcelona is that they did get Lionel Messi back into the starting lineup after his injury. He didn’t score, but his presence on the field commands so much respect that it opens space for Andres Iniesta and David Villa. The second and final game for this match up will be on May 1, at Camp Nou in Barcelona.</p>\n<p>In Borussia Dortmund’s win on Wednesday, the formula was no secret. Real Madrid was beaten by Robert Lewandowski. Whether it be the toughness around the net on a corner set piece or his shifty footwork followed by a beautiful top shelf shot, each one of his four goals put a particular scoring trait on display. Although Christiano Ronaldo did score a valuable away goal in the 43rd minute, Dortmund shouldn’t be too worried because they are now 2-0-1 this year against Real Madrid.</p>\n<p>In order to overturn the momentum and beat Dortmund, Real Madrid will have to play a much better team game the second time around. Even after they were up by three goals, Dortmund kept on the offensive attack because they had so much confidence in their team play. Real Madrid was just trying to set up Ronaldo with a long pass or out run them up and down the field. We will find out whether Madrid can score three goals and move on to the finals on April 30 at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid.</p>\n<p>While these deficits are imposing, Real Madrid and Barcelona are certainly capable of re-capturing their magic and turning it into a ticket to the championship round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of gtrt.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51022\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51022\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/germany-taking-over-soccer/","id":3186,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3185,3184,3183],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"History Made in the 2013 Masters Tournament","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"He can’t win the big one.

This winning putt, along with his 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole of regulation, will be remembered as two of the greatest putts in Master’s history.</p>\n<p>Those putts, and his final score of -9 in 74 holes, did not look anything at all like the play of an “un-clutch” player.

This year golf fans were treated to the youngest participant in history and a controversial ruling regarding the No. 1 player in the world. That’s right, 14-year-old Tianlang Guan of China was not only the youngest participant ever, he made the cut and won the Silver Cup. The Silver Cup is the trophy awarded to the tournament’s “low amateur,” or the amateur who posts the best four-day score in the tournament.</p>\n<p>The excitement surrounding Guan didn’t end there. On Friday, Guan became the first player in Master’s history to incur a penalty for slow play. Rules officials said that he was warned about his pace numerous times on the back nine and was finally assessed a penalty on the 17th hole.</p>\n<p>As for the controversy regarding the No. 1 ranked player in the world, Tiger Woods was assessed a two-stoke penalty for an illegal drop. On Friday at the fifteenth hole, Woods was chipping onto the green when his ball hit the flagstick and rolled into the water. Woods then elected to take a drop at the spot of his original chip; unfortunately, he dropped the ball two yards behind the original spot.</p>\n<p>What was controversial about it was that the rules committee assessed the penalty over night instead of on the course. That means that Woods signed an incorrect scorecard on Friday, which should result in an automatic disqualification. However, Rule 33 states that the rules committee can waive a disqualification in certain cases.</p>\n<p>The fact that the committee penalized Woods over night instead of during his round led them to waive his disqualification. Woods said later that he did not know he was breaking the rule by dropping the ball about two-yards behind the spot.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Woods finished at -5 and his major championship victory drought has now extended to 15 tournaments. Did the two stroke penalty cost Tiger a real shot at competing with Scott and Cabrera on the final day? We will never know.</p>\n<p>What we do know is that Tiger is getting closer to a major championship and to Jack Nicklaus’ record of 20 career major victories.</p>\n<p>As for the 2013 Masters, however, Tiger and the rest of the field could only watch as last year’s champion Bubba Watson presented Adam Scott with his Green Jacket and Scott immortalized himself into a legend for Australia and as a Masters Champion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 16, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50864\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50864\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-16/history-made-in-the-2013-masters-tournament/","id":3183,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[3182,3181,3180],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Top Performers After Week one of the MLB Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Major League baseball season is underway and the players are already treating fans with some unbelievable sights and stories.

All he did was hit .455 with 17 RBIs and four home runs. He set a MLB record with 16 RBIs in his team’s first four games and was also named AL Player of the Week for his efforts.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The man patrolling centerfield for the Orioles hasn’t started off too bad either. His name is Adam Jones and he is an emerging superstar. He is hitting .522 (15-30) with four doubles, one home run and eight RBIs. If the Orioles are going to repeat their success in the AL East from a year ago, they will need to pitch as well as they are hitting.</p>\n<p>Down in Atlanta, the Braves and Justin Upton are flexing their muscles in the NL East. Upton is hitting .423 with eight RBIs and leads the MLB with six home runs.</p>\n<p>The Braves are also getting some great production from their young first baseman Freddie Freeman. Before a trip to the 15-day disabled list for an oblique strain, Freeman was hitting .412 with seven RBIs in only five games. After the retirement of Chipper Jones, Freeman is slowly becoming one of the faces of the franchise.</p>\n<p>Atlanta certainly has the roster to challenge the Washington Nationals from clinching a second consecutive AL East title despite solid performances from youngsters such as Bryce Harper.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to have a better week than Clayton Kershaw had. He went 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA and a minute .44 WHIP. In their first game with the game tied at zero, Kershaw blasted a home run to go along with a complete game shutout. He was named NL Player of the Week and has Dodger fans thinking about a deep playoff run.</p>\n<p>Overall, Kershaw has led a dominant Dodgers pitching staff that has allowed a mere six runs in six games, good for a 1.00 ERA, by far tops in the majors. Whether or not the rest of the lineup can support the pitching staff with run support is another question.</p>\n<p>After a disappointing season last year, the Red Sox have put that all behind them. Clay Buchholz and Jon Lester are dominating on the mound. They have combined for three wins and have allowed only three earned runs.</p>\n<p>Their young third baseman Will Middlebrooks, is turning into a star. On Sunday, Middlebrooks hit three home runs and flied out to the warning track in his final at-bat.</p>\n<p>In an AL East that has no clear cut front-runner, Boston may be able to put together enough wins for a division title despite the firesale they displayed during last season’s trade deadline. Look for these players to put up some monster seasons and hopefully avoid the injury bug.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 9, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50734\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50734\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-09/the-top-performers-after-week-one-of-the-mlb-season/","id":2116,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[2115,2114,2113],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nexus Sports Examines Hottest Teams in the NHL","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NHL.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NHL.jpg?resize=666%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The National Hockey League is back and the painfully long off-season lockout seems like ancient history.

Although this season will only feature 48 games, it is proving to be worth the 119 day wait. The Blackhawks have earned a point in 28 straight games dating back to last season, making them tied for the second longest streak in league history. The Los Angeles Kings are playing very well recently, and Coach Darryl Sutter will have his team ready to defend Lord Stanley’s Cup. On the other side of the country, the fans in Pittsburgh are ecstatic to have Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin healthy and playing together again. These exciting storylines and record setting performances are crucial for the league to retain its integrity after an ugly offseason. Here is a review of some of the hottest teams and best players so far.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Chicago Blackhawks</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Just when it looked like the Blackhawks were finally going to lose in regulation this season, Patrick Kane netted a goal with 2:02 left in the final period of last Sunday’s game against the Red Wings. Then, Kane carried his team to a victory in an overtime shootout when he beat Detroit’s goaltender Jimmy Howard with a multiple-deke move.</p>\n<p>Kane is leading the team in goals, assists and overall points with 11, 15 and 26, respectively. If the Blackhawks continue their dominance and Kane keeps up this type of performance, he will be a strong contender for MVP.</p>\n<p>On the defensive side, goaltender Corey Crawford leads the league in average goals allowed with a stingy 1.41 per game. The Blackhawks also boast the best goal differential in the league at +29 and have allowed the fewest goals overall (41). Chicago plays will round out this week with two games against the Avalanche and one against the Oilers on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Anaheim Ducks</p>\n<p>After missing the playoffs last season, the Ducks have played much better hockey so far this season. They are second in the entire league with 33 points and are 7-2-1 in their last ten games.</p>\n<p>They do not have a dominant offensive scorer, but they can pass the puck. Six players have eleven or more assists, and ten players have five or more goals. Captain Ryan Getzlaf leads the team in goals(8), assists(17), and overall points(25).</p>\n<p>As for the men tending the goal, Viktor Fasth is 9-1 with an average of 2.08 goals allowed per game. Also, veteran Jonas Hiller is averaging a surprisingly high 3.24 goals allowed per game. The Ducks have lost consecutive games to the Coyotes, 5-4 in shootouts. Their next three games will be at home against the Coyotes, Flames and Blues.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Kings</p>\n<p>The defending Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings got off to a rough 3-7 start this season. However, Anze Kopitar and the rest of the Kings have won eight of their last ten games.</p>\n<p>Kopitar leads the team in points with 18, while fellow center Jeff Carter is first on the team and tied for second in the league with 14 goals. In the Kings 5-1 win over the Predators on Monday, Carter completed his fifth career hat trick with two goals within a 19 second span in the final period.</p>\n<p>After putting together one of the greatest post season performances ever last season, goaltender Jonathan Quick has struggled this season. He is a meager 6-6 this season and is allowing an average of 2.54 goals per game. Recently the Kings have been mixing in Jonathan Bernier between the pipes. Bernier is 5-1 this season as the goaltender and is allowing an average of 1.53 goals per game. The Kings have three more games on this homestand and then travel to play the Coyotes and Sharks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the Penguins have their superstars healthy and scoring the puck. As a team, they are second in the Eastern Conference and lead the league in average goals per game with 3.48.</p>\n<p>Sidney Crosby is leading the league in points with 36, and assists with 25. Right behind him is the Penguins left wing Chris Kunitz, who is second in the league with 28 points and first in plus-minus with 17. In addition to Kunitz and Crosby, they have seven other players with ten or more points this season. Left wing James Neal is tied for second in the league with 14 goals and Malkin is tied for fourth in the league with 18 assists.</p>\n<p>Their goaltender, Marc-Andre Fleury, is tied for the lead league in wins with 11 and is allowing an average of 2.44 goals per game. The Penguins are 7-3 in their last ten games and if their defense improves they will be a tough out in the playoffs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Montreal Canadiens</p>\n<p>The Canadiens are in first place in the Eastern Conference with 32 points. They are 7-3 in their last ten games and are allowing the fifth least amount of goals per game with 2.32.</p>\n<p>Goaltender Carey Price is tied for second in the league with 11 wins and tied for second in shutouts with two. After finishing in 28th place last season, the Canadiens have turned the page and are firing on all cylinders. In their game against the fourth place Bruins on Sunday, Montreal took advantage of the penalty on Boston’s key defender, Zdeno Chara, to take the lead for good in the third period.</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ice, the Canadiens are led by left wing Max Pacioretty, and centers David Desharnais and Tomas Plekanec. They have combined for a total of 49 points this season and are distributing the puck nicely. After yesterday’s game against the Islanders, Montreal will travel to the Hurricanes, Lightning and Panthers this week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>League Leaders (as of March 4)</p>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<p>17 – Steven Stamkos, Center, Tampa Bay Lightning</p>\n<p>14 – James Neal, Left Wing, Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>14 – Jeff Carter, Center, Los Angeles Kings</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Assists:</p>\n<p>25 – Sidney Crosby, Center, Pittsburgh Penguins</p>\n<p>23 – Martin St. Louis, Right Wing, Tampa Bay Lightning</p>\n<p>19 – Henrik Zetterberg, Left Wing, Detroit Red Wings</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Points:</p>\n<p>36 – Sidney Crosby, Center Pittsburg Penguins</p>\n<p>34 – Steven Stamkos, Center, Tampa Bay Lightning</p>\n<p>28 – Chris Kunitz, Left Wing, Pittsburg Penguins</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 6th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Artwork by Anna Xu of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50513\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50513\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/nexus-sports-examines-hottest-teams-in-the-nhl/","id":2115,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[2114,2113,2112],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"World Baseball Classic: MLB’s Friend or Foe?","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Tired of watching meaningless spring training baseball games?

Me too. Good thing the 2013 World Baseball Classic begins this weekend. The first WBC was held in 2006 and was played every three years until 2009, when it switched to every four years. It was created in response to baseball being voted out of the Olympics in 2005.<br>\nThe WBC is a great event because it spreads the game of baseball to other parts of the world, gives the fans a chance to see great players who do not play in the MLB already and also gives the players the opportunity to represent their home countries. For example, the baseball world was largely unaware of players like Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish and Yoenis Cespedes until they were lighting up the WBC. Now they are all playing and succeeding in the MLB.<br>\nHowever, the WBC does have one big flaw. When baseball was an Olympic sport, only amateur players could participate. The WBC, on the other hand, has no restrictions on who can play. Here lies the predicament: If you were an owner of a MLB franchise, would you want one of your star players playing and possibly getting hurt in the WBC? You are paying this player a lot of money to win games and fill the seats at your stadium, not to play in an international tournament that has no bearing on the MLB season. Take the Milwaukee Brewers for example. They are sending 13 of their players to various teams in the WBC including their big league catcher Jonathan Lucroy, ace starting pitcher Yovani Gallardo and former MVP outfielder Ryan Braun. If those players come back worn out or injured, then their season and their financial investments would be in serious jeopardy.<br>\nIn the last two WBC tournaments, the extra games have had the most negative effects on the pitchers. At this time in Spring Training, the pitchers are beginning their throwing routines and side bullpen sessions in preparation for the upcoming season. The WBC, however, requires the pitchers to go out and pitch in real games with maximum effort when they would normally be easing into the heavy workload. This can cause strain and fatigue on a pitcher’s arm, which is exactly what all of the MLB teams who are signing the players’ paychecks do not want.<br>\nLooking at the groups, Pool A consists of Cuba, Japan, Brazil and China. Brazil and China are not big baseball countries so Cuba and Japan are pretty safe. Japan has won both of the previous two tournaments and Cuba always has a few star players who will eventually play in the MLB. Pool B is made up by Australia, Chinese Taipei, Korea and the Netherlands. Look for Korea to easily advance followed by a struggle for the second spot.<br>\nPool C is considered the power pool with the likes of the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Spain and Venezuela. The Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Puerto Rico all feature multiple major league stars like Robinson Cano, Carlos Beltran, Hanley Ramirez, Yadier Molina, Miguel Cabrera, Pablo Sandoval and many others.<br>\nThen there is Pool D with Canada, Italy, Mexico and the United States. The U.S. should easily win this pool followed by either Mexico or Canada. Groups A and B will begin pool play on March 2 followed by groups C and D starting on March 7.<br>\nThe top two teams from each group will advance to the second round, which will be held at the Marlins’ stadium in Miami and at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. The top four teams will then advance to the championship round hosted at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco.<br>\nHopefully the U.S. can bring the title home and back to the birthplace of baseball. But before you ask why the U.S. roster does not include every great American player like Justin Verlander, Mike Trout or Buster Posey, you must ask yourself: Would you rather see the U.S. win the WBC or see your favorite team open the season with a healthy roster?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of February 26th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50363\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50363\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-26/world-baseball-classic-mlbs-friend-or-foe/","id":4499,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[4498,4497,4496],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Lakers at a Crossroads Without Owner Jerry Buss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Los Angeles Lakers have lost a legend.

Along with the Yankees’ former owner George Steinbrenner, Buss always did what it took to make his team the best. He never shied away from the biggest personalities or from opening up the checkbook to sign players and coaches like Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, James Worthy, Pat Riley, Phil Jackson, Shaquille O’Neil, Steve Nash, Dwight Howard and, of course, Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>But now all of that is in the past. His death, along with the fact that the Lakers’ supposed “super team” is a meager 25-29 and the Clippers are turning into a powerhouse, confirm that the Lakers franchise is at a major turning point. Without the wise and omniscient leadership of Dr. Buss, where does one of the most beloved and recognizable franchises in the world go from here?</p>\n<p>First of all, if the Lakers miraculously make the playoffs, the consensus is that they don’t have the tools or chemistry to consistently beat any one of the top teams in the Western Conference. They simply do not put together a consistent winning formula night in and night out.</p>\n<p>Howard’s health and attitude seem to be in a constant state of uncertainty. Nash and Coach D’Antoni are torn between running a quick-paced offense and running a slower half-court offense. Kobe is still playing well, but is beginning to hint at retirement.</p>\n<p>Above all else, this Lakers team no longer expects to win. When the Lakers are at their best, they expect to win every single game. Now the first question is how badly did they lose tonight?</p>\n<p>Looking beyond this year, Bryant has one year left on his contract worth $30.4 million, Howard becomes a free agent after this season, Gasol has one year left on his contract worth $19.2 million, Metta World Peace has a player option for next year worth $7.7 million and Nash has two years remaining worth a combined $20 million.</p>\n<p>All of that means that after next season, Nash will be the only current player under contract assuming Howard, Gasol and Bryant all leave. So, what do the Lakers need to do? What they always do, use the salary cap space to spend the money and use the L.A. lifestyle to bring championship players to their team.</p>\n<p>One thing that would go a long way in helping the Lakers achieve that would be to retain the services of current General Manager Mitch Kupchak, who was Dr. Buss’ right-hand man.

Five years later, those expectations have come to fruition, as the senior goalkeeper exits as one of the all-time great water polo players in Gaucho history.</p>\n<p>Christian will be graduating this year after five years of consistent production and leadership. He leaves UCSB ranked fourth in career saves with 607, and his 238 saves in his senior season are fourth all-time for single season saves at UCSB. Also in his senior season, Christian finished third in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with 11.61 saves per game and posted a career-best 19 saves on Oct. 21 at UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“That game was definitely the highlight of my career, it was fun,” Christian said. “I would also say beating Stanford and UCLA in the SoCal tournament as some of the highlights of my career.

As a senior and one of the most experienced players on the team, Christian was named a team captain along with fellow senior Brian Shoemaker.</p>\n<p>“As far as his leadership, Myles leads by example and people really want to be around him,” Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. “He has such a great work ethic. I think it really rubs off on his teammates.”</p>\n<p>However, Christian’s college career did not begin with stardom right away. In 2008, his first year at UCSB, Christian redshirted and then shared playing time during his freshman and sophomore seasons with upperclassman Fraser Bunn.</p>\n<p>“It was a good experience; Fraser was a really good goalie and I learned a lot from him,” Christian said. “It was nice to not have all of the pressure on me right away.”</p>\n<p>In 2009, his freshman year of eligibility, Christian made six starts and tallied 84 saves. In a 10-9 overtime loss to Loyola Marymount, Christian collected 15 saves which was at the time a career best.</p>\n<p>“Myles is definitely a leader not only in the pool, but all around,” junior guard Dylan Baliani said. “He works hard at everything he does. It’s not so much of what he says, but [what] he does. He is the perfect example of a guy who leads by example.”</p>\n<p>In his sophomore season, Christian appeared in 18 games for UCSB and accumulated 115 saves with 18 steals. Then in 2011, Christian got the full starting job and posted 170 saves with 25 steals to lead the team.</p>\n<p>“It’s always a great feeling when you get the starting job. I felt like by [2011], I had enough experience, and it wasn’t too much pressure so I could enjoy it everyday,” Christian said.</p>\n<p>Before he was a Gaucho, Christian was a stand-out at Newport Harbor High School where he received countless awards and honors. As a senior, Christian led the Sailors to a CIF Division I championship and was named to First Team All-Sunset League, First Team All-County, First Team All- CIF Division I and First Team All-American. With all that success, Christian garnered a lot of attention from college coaches.</p>\n<p>“The two main schools I was looking at were UCSB and Long Beach State,” Christian said. “There was some interest in going to somewhere like UCLA or USC, but they had a few goalies already and UCSB was lacking in that area. Then I came up on my recruiting trip and just immediately fell in love, how could you not? In the end it was an easy choice.”</p>\n<p>The fact that UCSB was the “easy choice” for Myles has made a lot of teammates and Gaucho fans happy. Many of them were eager to offer their thoughts and respect for Myles, who impresses in everything he does.</p>\n<p>“Myles was probably the best goalie in the country this past year, most of the goals that he allowed were the result of missed shot blocks and defensive mistakes,” sophomore attacker Derek Shoemaker said. “He was also a great captain and leader. He set up various team activities to keep us out of trouble and he was usually in charge of getting our team dinners as well. It’s almost as if he was another coach.”</p>\n<p>In his life after UCSB, Christian will be leaving water polo behind but will still be making saves. However, these saves will not be of potential goals, but of human lives.</p>\n<p>“I’m graduating in the spring and right now I’m working as an EMT with the Santa Barbara County Fire Department so I’ll have that job until I graduate,” Christian said. “Then I am looking to stay up here and go to the fire academy and hopefully become a firefighter here in Santa Barbara.”</p>\n<p>In his final comments, Christian offered some lasting pieces of advice and leadership for the rest of the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Work together, always support each other,” Christian said. “They have so much talent. They just need to work together, show up to practice everyday and work hard. They could be really successful next year if that happens.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 28, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49054\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49054\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/extra-mile/","id":5168,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[5167,5166,5165],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Finish MPSF Play With Loss","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Water Polo","publish_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s water polo team finished regular season Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play with a 12-10 loss to Long Beach State on Saturday, failing to take advantage of a halftime lead.

We have been in a slump and I know that this will be my last home game, so it would be nice to finish it off with a win.”</p>\n<p>With junior attacker Evan Dellinger — UCSB’s leading scorer with 42 — battling an injury, the Gauchos have had to find offensive production from other players. One player who has stepped us his game recently is sophomore attacker Eric Van de Mortel. Van de Mortel is now third on the team with 28 goals and has led UCSB in scoring the past three games.</p>\n<p>“I have been a little more aggressive in my attacking,” Van de Mortel said. “I have been practicing only shots I would take in games, while trying to think about the situation I am usually in. So like altering my shot as if someone is blocking even if there’s nobody there when I am practicing. Also, I have just been trying to work as hard as possible for these last few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Matt Gronow is another option. The junior attacker ranks second on the team and has tallied 41 goals on the year, just one behind Dellinger.</p>\n<p>As this is the final home game for the Gauchos, UCSB will recognize and honor its two seniors: captains Brian Shoemaker and Christian.</p>\n<p>“I’m sad that is has to come to an end because I’ve had a lot of great memories playing in that pool,” Shoemaker said. “I’m going to do everything I can to come out with a win.”</p>\n<p>Game time for Saturday’s game against Long Beach State is set for 12 p.m. at Campus Pool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 16, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48976\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-plays-final-home-match-long-beach/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48976\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-plays-final-home-match-long-beach/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-plays-final-home-match-long-beach/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-plays-final-home-match-long-beach/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-16/ucsb-plays-final-home-match-long-beach/","id":5166,"author":{"id":77,"name":"Tanner Gore"},"related":[5165,5164,5163],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/77"}},"__N_SSG":true}
