CSD), will allow individuals to borrow one of the 1,200 bicycles that will be available.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are approximately 20,000 registered bicycles within UCSB and I.V.’s two square miles, according to the Associated Students Bicycle Committee.</p>\n<p>Matt Dobberteen, alternative transport manager from the Santa Barbara Public Works department, presented the program to the I.V. CSD alongside Mo Lovegreen, UCSB director of campus sustainability, on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking at a potential launch date of June 25, 2018, for the first allocation of 600 bikes in the area,” Dobberteen said.</p>\n<p>Following the first launch date, an additional 600 bikes will arrive in August, he explained.</p>\n<p>Each bike has an individual GPS tracking unit and bike lock attached, according to Dobberteen. This eliminates the need for a bike rack and lowers the chances of theft.</p>\n<p>Currently, the I.V. CSD is trying to find parking spaces for the bicycles.</p>\n<p>Every CSD board member supported the program, but a few members expressed skepticism about the program not having a permanent bike rack for students to park in.</p>\n<p>CSD Director Jay Freeman questioned how students would be prevented from leaving the bikes piled up on the side of the street.</p>\n<p>Dobberteen said watching the flow of bikes and where they end up will be an important learning tool.</p>\n<p>“If there are heaps of bikes all over, we have failed,” he said.</p>\n<p>Dobberteen said potential solutions include giving students incentives to return bikes to a designated location in the evening or hiring a company that would park the bicycles in a designated location during the night.</p>\n<p>Lovegreen added that UCSB’s Department of Campus Sustainability also has plans to start a new outreach program for the bike sharing service starting next week. The program is directed at incoming freshmen in an attempt to persuade them to not bring their own bikes.</p>\n<p>The board of directors said the central problem with the program is finding the space for the bikes and persuading students to use the bikes in a respectful manner.</p>\n<p>“This is about us bringing high quality transportation to the community, and if we are respectful, it benefits everyone,” Dobberteen added.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-82733\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-82733\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/bike-sharing-program-soon-to-reach-isla-vista-ucsb/","id":2276,"author":{"id":83,"name":"Luke Dorsey"},"related":[2275,2274,2273],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/83"}},"__N_SSG":true}
