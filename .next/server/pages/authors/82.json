Fullerton is the number two seed after their win over Long Beach but second or third seed doesn’t make much difference because we would still play each other before the championship game. Senior night was great. Probably the most fun I’ve had playing in a game my entire career here at UCSB. We had a substantial lead the entire game and that allowed us to play more relaxed and have fun with each other more. This next weekend can either make or break our season. The past two years we have upset Long Beach in the final to get the automatic bid to the NCAA tourney and we will have to do it again if we hope to make it back for a third consecutive year. We are starting to play some of the best basketball we have played all year long and it couldn’t be at a better time. Everything changes around tourney time. Attitudes become more focused, games become more physical and coaches will lose their shit easier. Beach crushed it in conference losing only their last game to Fullerton and they will be heavily favored to win it again. The bus we have for this road trip is epic. SB Airbus is testing out some new buses I guess and the one we’re on has leather seats and tables and is way more comfortable than their other dust-infested buses. Tomorrow we’re playing Pacific, who we played a week ago and beat at home. Although it is hard to beat a team three times, we are focused and ready to go. It’s hard to play three consecutive days in a row but that adds to the excitement of the whole tourney. I mean, it’s better than practicing, that’s for sure. Practice yesterday was good. Short but sweet and all I did was watch mostly after having surgery to reset my nose, which I broke last week in practice. Playing at the Honda Center is pretty fun. It’s a huge arena and you can feel the cool breeze on the court from the ice underneath it for the hockey rink. I’m looking forward to playing in my last Big West tourney and I feel the rest of the team is excited as well. Everyone is healthy and ready to go and bring home a third Big West tourney title in as many years.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45459\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45459\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-08/gauchos-ready-awaiting-challenge-anaheim/","id":739,"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson"},"related":[738,737,736],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Win at Home, and off on the Road Again","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"So after a nice week home and a win against Riverside on Saturday night, we’re back on the road for the next week basically.

The game against Riverside didn’t go exactly as I thought it would. We came out pretty flat and basically played like shit the first half, but we managed to put together a decent second half and were able to win, which is all that matters really. Now this road trip I don’t think anyone is looking forward to. We’re driving down Tuesday afternoon, playing Wednesday night and driving back to SB after the game Wednesday night only to get back on the bus Thursday around noon to drive back down to LAX for our flight to Utah where we’re playing Utah State on Saturday night for our bracket buster game. Get back on Sunday at some time and then on Tuesday we leave for Long Beach. So it’s gonna be a long week of playing good teams and sitting around the hotel doing jack shit. Can’t believe we have to go back to Utah. Only rThis eason I want to go to Utah is to snowboard. Provo was boring as hell and I don’t have very high expectations for Logan either. Why we are driving back to SB just to go back down to LA less than 12 hours later beats the hell outta me. I suppose it’s for the guys to go to class but let’s be honest here, who is going to attend class when we’re only home for a few hours. Probably only one player and that’s Boswell who’s a mechanical engineering major, so it’s understandable. On another note this is probably the nicest winter we’ve had in SB since I’ve been up here. Knock on wood and hope it continues because it never gets old. Enjoy it while you can because it’s not gonna last forever and it being my last few months here has made me appreciate Santa Barbara even more. That’s all I got for now, gonna throw on my headphones and stare at the oil rigs and islands as we drive down the 101 with Stormin’ Norman at the wheel.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44686\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44686\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/win-home-road/","id":750,"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson"},"related":[749,748,747],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Road Trip Up North","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The following is the first Online Nexus Sports Blog, from Christian Peterson, senior forward on the UCSB men’s basketball team.

On the other hand, for many teammates who have grown up in NorCal, it’s their favorite road trip, as they get to see a lot of family members and friends who come out to support the team on the road. The bus ride up to Davis wasn’t too bad. It took us around five hours or so, but we went straight to practice off the bus without going to the hotel or anything first, which always sucks because we didn’t get time to just chill out for a little at the hotel. Our first game was against Davis, who has been struggling for much of the year. Our focus coming into the game was to work on execution and putting a team away once we have the lead. As far as the game goes, we played pretty well, moved the ball around the best we have all season long and ended up winning by around 30. The next day we drove to Pacific and had a light practice, just going over our game plan and getting loosened up a little. The game was at 5 o’clock because it was on TV up in that area and it was nice having a game at 5 o’clock so we weren’t just sitting around the hotel all day waiting for game time. The game against Pacific was a bit tougher than the game against Davis and it got close at the end when we didn’t execute as well as we should have, but we got the win and that’s what’s most important. For those who are from NorCal it was nice because we then had the night to spend with family and friends until our curfew that night. My least favorite part of this particular road trip has always been the drive home because we get up on Sunday and spend the majority of the day sitting in a stuffy bus driving along with absolutely nothing to look at with the smell of hundreds of cows. It ended up taking us around six hours to get home on Sunday and by the time we got home our day was pretty much shot and almost everyone had homework that needed to be done before class on Monday. Practice on Monday was good: short and to the point, which is always nice after a five-day road trip. Coming up we have Northridge and Fullerton, both teams we have already played and beaten, but now we play them on the road, which is always harder than home games.</p>\n<p><em>Stay tuned for more from Christian and the UCSB men’s basketball team continues its conference play.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-02/road-trip-north/","id":742,"author":{"id":82,"name":"Christian Peterson"},"related":[741,740,739],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/82"}},"__N_SSG":true}
