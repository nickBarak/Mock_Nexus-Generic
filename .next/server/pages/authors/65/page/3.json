(<em>Daily Nexus/File photo</em>)</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB men’s basketball team finished in second place in the Great Alaska Shootout after losing to Colorado State 65-63 in the tournament final on Saturday. A pair of free throws decided the game after junior guard Michael Bryson attempted a steal, but was instead called for a foul with 5.9 seconds left.</p>\n<p>The loss drops the Gauchos to .500 at 3-3 overall. Prior to the final, UCSB outlasted Mercer University in a 65-60 overtime game in the semifinals and easily defeated Washington State 71-43 in the opening round.</p>\n<p>After leading Colorado State for much of the first half, the Gauchos trailed in the final moments of the second until junior guard John Green nailed a game-tying three-pointer with 10 seconds remaining. Santa Barbara struggled advancing the ball after the made free throws and a shot 30 feet out from senior center Alan Williams missed as time expired.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Redshirt senior forward Stanton Kidd led the Rams with 14 points and his teammate, junior guard Gian Clavell, added 13 points; their consecutive three-pointers capped off a 10-2 run in the second half that shifted momentum towards Colorado State.</p>\n<p>Williams finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Gauchos and ended with the third-most rebounds in tournament history with 44.

Whether or not it’s a bad team or not, getting a win is getting a win.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB controlled the game from the beginning and jumped out to a 14-4 lead in large part to its shooting. The Gauchos suffered from a shooting slump in their first two games, but it was a completely different story against the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara closed out the half leading 47-22 with the team making 52 percent of its shots from the field and going 5-8 from three-point range. Bryson scored 14 of his 20 points in the half, with him shooting an efficient 3-5 from long distance; in previous games, he averaged 25 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the half, UCSB wasted no time putting away its opponent and jumped out to a 17-1 run in the beginning minutes. The Master’s College best player, senior guard Russell Byrd, was bottled up by the Gaucho defense. Byrd was limited to 20 points and five rebounds, however, the defense forced him to turn the ball over 11 times.</p>\n<p>Having a significant advantage rebounding and shooting well, the Gauchos led the game by as much as 34 points midway through the second half, eventually putting the contest out of reach.</p>\n<p>“I thought we did several things pretty good,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We shot the ball well, we moved the ball well and we pretty much took advantage of them on the glass rebounding the ball well.”</p>\n<p>Unlike in previous games, senior center Alan Williams had a relatively quiet game, finishing with 12 points and eight rebounds. Instead, the Gauchos relied on Big Al drawing the defense and serving as a distributor.</p>\n<p>“They doubled down on [Williams] so much that he was able to find us and we were able to shoot well,” Bryson said. “The ball is going to go through him and we’re going to get good looks out of him because he’s the best player in the league.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard John Green continues showing what he can contribute when healthy. Green scored 14 points, second most on the team, to go along with seven rebounds. Green’s scrappy defense and ability to shoot jumpers and take the ball inside were seen when he was on the court. It marked Green’s third game of the season, one game shy of his total games played his previous three years on the team.</p>\n<p>“I feel better than ever,” Green said. “I worked really hard working off my injuries … It’s just a good feeling to contribute.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard DaJuan Smith started the game in place of the injured freshman guard Gabe Vincent, who was held off because of a blister injury on his foot. Smith made the most of his start and scored seven points, but was the main ball facilitator with seven assists on the night.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara plays again beginning Thursday in the Great Alaska Shootout, a three-game tournament featuring eight programs. UCSB’s first matchup is against Pac-12 team, Washington State. The game will be played in the Alaska Airlines Center in Anchorage.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Mustangs come in at 2-1 on the season after defeating La Sierra earlier this week. </p>\n<p>Senior center Alan Williams has started the year on a tear en route to being named Big West Player of the Week for the ninth time, the most in conference history. The double-double machine has been just that so far, averaging 25.5 points per game on 75 percent shooting from the field, and grabbing 14.5 rebounds per game. </p>\n<p>“What he’s improved so much form last year is his poise in the post,” Bromley said. “He can be double teamed, they can throw different guys at him and he just has great poise. He’s a lot better passer off the post.” </p>\n<p>The road trip also previewed what junior guard John Green is capable of contributing off the bench this season. Green played significant minutes in the FGCU game, scoring a career-high 17 points and drawing two offensive fouls on the other end of the court.  </p>\n<p>A factor that has caused problems for the Gauchos is their three-point shooting percentage. In each of its two regular season games, UCSB has shot below 22 percent from behind the arc, an area of concern considering the team likes to play an inside-outside game, with shooters on the perimeter needed to relieve pressure from Big Al when he is working in the post. </p>\n<p>“His feel for the game is hard to teach, he really kind of sees different areas of the floor,” Bromley said. “He has good feel of rhythm of when to attack off the dribble, when to attack off post penetration, when to share the basketball.” </p>\n<p>For UCSB to start improving from three-point range, junior guard Michael Bryson, the team’s leading three-point shooter from last season, will need to start making shots. Bryson has only sunk 25 percent of his opportunities from long distance despite being tied on the team for most attempts. </p>\n<p>“I think we just need to keep shooting, honestly,” Bryson said. “ [Head Coach Bob Williams] is making it clear, they’re good shots, you just got to keep shooting them.”</p>\n<p>For the Mustangs, senior forward Chris Patureau leads the team in scoring with 17.3 points per game. Sophomore guard Evan Jenkins will be the primary ball-handler and takes responsibility for setting up the offense in transition and in half-court sets.</p>\n<p>Tip-off on Saturday at the Thunderdome is set for 4:00 p.m.   </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 20, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58484\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/gauchos-look-for-first-win-of-the-season-in-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58484\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/gauchos-look-for-first-win-of-the-season-in-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/gauchos-look-for-first-win-of-the-season-in-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/gauchos-look-for-first-win-of-the-season-in-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/gauchos-look-for-first-win-of-the-season-in-home-opener/","id":289,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[288,287,286],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Outlasted By Florida Gulf Coast in OT","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Big games from Alan Williams and John Green offset by FGCU heroics.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58388\" style=\"width: 386px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.18.2014-1143.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"755214161\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58399\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58388\" data-attachment-id=\"58388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/ucsb-outlasted-by-florida-gulf-coast-in-ot/m-basketball-by-cameryn-brock_for-11-18-2014-1143/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.18.2014-1143.jpg?fit=1066%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1066,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415604347\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"68\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"M Basketball by Cameryn Brock_for 11.18.2014-1143\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.18.2014-1143.jpg?fit=222%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.18.2014-1143.jpg?fit=888%2C999&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58388\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.18.2014-1143-909x1024.jpg?resize=376%2C424\" alt=\"Eric Childress and company were a few plays away from the team's first win of the season.

The current Big West Player of the Week finished with 29 points, 16 rebounds and four assists despite FGCU playing tough defense and using multiple defenders to guard him.</p>\n<p>Junior guard John Green came off the bench and was the second-leading scorer on the night for Santa Barbara with 17 points. Green was effective on both sides of the court, making big buckets and drawing offensive fouls on defense before fouling out.</p>\n<p>The game was tight for most of the second half with both sides sharing the lead. FGCU began the half looking to extend its 32-28 first half advantage and were effective coming out of the half. Yet, the Gauchos went on a 7-0 run to close the gap after junior guard Michael Bryson knocked down a corner three-pointer on a skip pass from Williams.</p>\n<p>From there on, the Gauchos clamped down defensively and closed down driving lanes to set up the close finish before going into overtime with the score tied at 64.</p>\n<p>It was in overtime where the Eagles began taking control of the game. FGCU took advantage of fouls committed by UCSB and converted from the charity stripe to gain separation. With 27 seconds left to play, the Eagles were winning 77-74 after a made free throw by sophomore guard Eric Childress. Despite the attempted comeback, the rally fell short as FGCU made its free throw attempts and controlled the boards in the period.</p>\n<p>Williams was limited to only one basket in OT as the big man played with more caution after picking up his fourth foul. Foul trouble, as in the previous game, plagued the Gauchos. Bryson and freshman guard Gabe Vincent were forced to sit parts of the game after getting into early foul trouble.</p>\n<p>Another area concern for the Gauchos was in the three-point shooting category. Santa Barbara shot only 22 percent from behind the arc, going a total of 5-23 on the night.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, senior guard Brett Comer was just as dynamic as Williams on the offensive end, finishing with 28 points to lead the Eagles.</p>\n<p>After two games on the road to start the season, UCSB returns home for its first regular season matchup at the Thunderdome. The team will face The Master’s College on Saturday as it looks to get back into the win column.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58399\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/ucsb-outlasted-by-florida-gulf-coast-in-ot/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58399\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/ucsb-outlasted-by-florida-gulf-coast-in-ot/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/ucsb-outlasted-by-florida-gulf-coast-in-ot/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/ucsb-outlasted-by-florida-gulf-coast-in-ot/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-18/ucsb-outlasted-by-florida-gulf-coast-in-ot/","id":508,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[507,506,505],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Williams’ Big Night Not Enough to Upset Kansas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In front of 16,300 Jayhawks fans, UCSB men's basketball held its own against No. 5 Kansas despite losing.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58332\" style=\"width: 399px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.17.2014-1151.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1748605778\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58348\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58332\" data-attachment-id=\"58332\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-17/williams-big-night-not-enough-to-upset-kansas/m-basketball-by-cameryn-brock_for-11-17-2014-1151/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.17.2014-1151.jpg?fit=898%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415604955\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"35\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"M Basketball by Cameryn Brock_for 11.17.2014-1151\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.17.2014-1151.jpg?fit=187%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.17.2014-1151.jpg?fit=766%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58332\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M-Basketball-by-Cameryn-Brock_for-11.17.2014-1151-766x1024.jpg?resize=389%2C520\" alt=\"Big Al showed he can play with anyone on Friday.

However, foul trouble and low shooting percentage proved too much to overcome for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Williams showed he could play against the elite programs of the nation, putting up big numbers even though he was heavily guarded the entire night. Big Al did not get much help from his teammates as the team shot only 21 percent from three-point range and were heavily outrebounded, losing the battle 42-31.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Meanwhile, Kansas benefitted from a total team performance. Four players scored in double-digits for the Jayhawks with junior forward Perry Ellis scoring 13 and totaling 10 rebounds for the seventh double-double of his career.</p>\n<p>The game changer for Kansas came off the bench in the form of freshman guard Devonte’ Graham. Graham led the team with 14 points and spearheaded a first half 11-2 run that erased UCSB’s 15-14 lead; Graham scored eight of those points and assisted on the other bucket before the half ended with Kansas up 31-23.</p>\n<p>Before that run, UCSB had done a solid job on defense but its 27 percent shooting from the field in the half prevented the team from threatening Kansas even more.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Santa Barbara came to play to start the second half. Trailing by 12 three minutes into the half, the Gauchos scored 10 unanswered points with consecutive treys by freshman guard Gabe Vincent and senior guard Zalmico Harmon cutting KU’s lead to 39-37.</p>\n<p>That was as close as UCSB got to taking back the lead, however, as foul trouble began to creep up for the Gauchos. Kansas scored 13 points from the charity stripe after the run and went to the line for 20 attempts in the half, shooting 80 percent. In total, the Jayhawks converted 23-32 free throws while UCSB went 9-14.</p>\n<p>Another bright spot for the Gauchos besides Big Al was junior guard John Green. Green entered early in the game after junior forward Mitch Brewe was forced to leave after picking up two early fouls. In 16 minutes of play, Green, who has been limited to four games in three years, had nine points on four-of-seven shots from the field.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays again today on the road against Florida-Gulf Coast University. FGCU plays in the Atlantic Sun conference and enters 1-0 on the season. Last year the team went 22-13 overall and was selected to the National Invitational Tournament. Two years ago, the program went to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is scheduled for <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_533765254\"><span class=\"aQJ\">4

opponent ranked in the top five in the nation. That all changes tomorrow however, as the Gauchos enter one of the loudest environments in college basketball to play against No. 5 Kansas on the road.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think there is any way to recreate what type of environment we’re going into,” junior guard Michael Bryson said. “I think it’s going to be upon us to make sure we handle the pressure and handle the hostility they’re going to bring to us, and make sure we can focus on what we need to do.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters Allen Fieldhouse after defeating Division II opponent, Point Loma, 70-54. In that game, senior center Alan “Big Al” Williams showed his dominance in the low post as he totaled 20 points and 19 rebounds. Despite the win, the Gauchos will have to limit mistakes it committed against Point Loma, primarily in the turnover department, if it plans staying on pace with the Jayhawks.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Kansas is one of the most storied programs in all of college basketball. The program has won three national championships with its most recent coming in 2008. Kansas is coming off two exhibition wins, most recently against Emporia State where the team won 109-56.</p>\n<p>This will be the toughest away game for the Gauchos, who will rely on team chemistry to survive high-pressure situations in the game.</p>\n<p>“You got enough senior leadership and a bunch of new guys that want to go out there and prove themselves and show that they belong here,” Big Al said. “It’s a good chemistry. We got a good group of guys, guys that are tough-minded, that will be ready to go out there and do some damage.”</p>\n<p>After losing two players picked in the top three of the 2014 NBA Draft in Andrew Wiggins (Minnesota Timberwolves) and Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers), Kansas is still the experts pick this year to win the Big 12 conference title and contend for a national championship.</p>\n<p>Kansas centers on a talented crop of freshmen that are rated among the best in the nation. Five-star recruit, power forward Cliff Alexander is expected to make significant impact as he is a  projected starter on the team.</p>\n<p>Alexander, at 6’8’’ and weighing in at 240 pounds, will look to command the post and go head-to-head with Big Al. The freshman is known for his strength, athleticism and rebounding capability.</p>\n<p>“He’s really long-armed, very bouncy off the floor, got a big strong body,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I’m anxious to see if Al gets it going, if they actually allow one guy to guard him. Normally most everyone we play, they double team him. So it’ll be interesting to see if Kansas immediately surrenders to that and tries to double team him.”</p>\n<p>Although the freshmen will grab the headlines for Kansas, the team’s best player must be junior power forward Perry Ellis. Ellis is the team’s second leading scorer from last season at 13.5 points per game, but is looking to increase his point total this year as he becomes the leader for Kansas.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, limiting second chances point and blocking out will be key considering KU’s athleticism. Defensively, Santa Barbara will rely on a half-court game to limit fast break opportunities and deter any chance of the crowd getting involved. Big Al will again be the go-to guy on offense with shooters on the perimeter stretching out the floor for open shots.</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Kansas is scheduled for 5 p.m. and will be available to view on ESPN3.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 13, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58193\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/big-al-leads-ucsb-into-season-opener-against-no-5-kansas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58193\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/big-al-leads-ucsb-into-season-opener-against-no-5-kansas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/big-al-leads-ucsb-into-season-opener-against-no-5-kansas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/big-al-leads-ucsb-into-season-opener-against-no-5-kansas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/big-al-leads-ucsb-into-season-opener-against-no-5-kansas/","id":502,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[501,500,499],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big Al the Difference Against Point Loma","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A strong first half for UCSB men's basketball propelled the team to victory.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58115\" style=\"width: 348px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/williams.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1549410229\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58114\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58115\" data-attachment-id=\"58115\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/williams-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/williams.png?fit=975%2C1481&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"975,1481\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/williams.png?fit=165%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/williams.png?fit=674%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58115\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/williams-674x1024.png?resize=338%2C513\" alt=\"Big Al picked up where he left off last season, totaling a game-high 20 points and 19 rebounds in last night's game.

However, not until late in the second half did UCSB put away the scrappy Sea Lions team.</p>\n<p>Point Loma was within 10 points with five minutes left in the game, but a series of buckets from the Gauchos pinned Point Loma into too deep of a hole with little time left. An open three-point shot by junior guard DaJuan Smith extended UCSB’s lead to 60-46 and sealed the win.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Big Al showed no signs of regression from last year. The big man logged a team-high 31 minutes, but it was on the glass where his presence was truly felt. Williams’ 19 boards contributed to Santa Barbara’s 45 on the night, a decisive rebounding edge compared to Point Loma’s 24. That led to UCSB outscoring the Sea Lions in second chance opportunities, 20-6.</p>\n<p>After a strong first-half performance, the Gauchos let their guard down in the second half. Point Loma shot significantly better from the field at 45.8 percent, as opposed to 34.6 percent in the first half. Santa Barbara shot a respectable 40.6 percent, but nowhere near the 51.7 percent it shot in the first half.</p>\n<p>Despite the increase, the Gauchos were too much to overcome and led throughout the game. Freshman guard Gabe Vincent got the start and made a strong impression in his debut, scoring 13 points to go with three assists and two steals. A flash of what he can do on the perimeter was seen as he made two shots from three-point range on six attempts.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Michael Bryson added six points with two three-pointers made and senior guard Zalmico Harmon scored eight points on four-of-seven shooting, with a team-high four assists on the night.</p>\n<p>In 15 minutes of action off the bench, junior guard John Green nailed half of his shots, including a three-pointer, to give him seven points and five rebounds. Green, who has been hampered by injury in his collegiate career, will be a key player in the rotation if able to stay healthy.</p>\n<p>For Point Loma, leading the way for the team were senior guard Hayden Lescault and junior guard Judd Welfringer; each scored 12 points on the night for the Sea Lions. Lescault finished tied with team-highs in assists (4) and rebounds (5).</p>\n<p>UCSB will face a much tougher opponent in its first official regular season game against No. 5 Kansas. The Gauchos will take on the Jayhawks at Phog Allen Fieldhouse this Friday and the game will be available to view on ESPN 3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58114\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58114\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-11/big-al-the-difference-against-point-loma/","id":494,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[493,492,491],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"New Season Brings Championship Aspirations","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Before its first regular season game at Kansas, UCSB men's basketball prepares for D-II opponent, Point Loma.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_58099\" style=\"width: 287px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/15-Alan-Williams-photo_FILE-PHOTO.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1625145576\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58098\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58099\" data-attachment-id=\"58099\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/new-season-brings-championship-aspirations/15-alan-williams-photo_file-photo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/15-Alan-Williams-photo_FILE-PHOTO.jpg?fit=292%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"292,480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"15 Alan Williams photo_FILE PHOTO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/15-Alan-Williams-photo_FILE-PHOTO.jpg?fit=152%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/15-Alan-Williams-photo_FILE-PHOTO.jpg?fit=292%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58099\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/15-Alan-Williams-photo_FILE-PHOTO.jpg?resize=277%2C457\" alt=\"Senior center Alan Williams enters as one of the best players in the nation and leads an  experienced UCSB team.

Headlined by senior center Alan “Big Al” Williams, UCSB enters with its best opportunity of reaching the Big Dance in recent memory.</p>\n<p>Picked to finish second in the conference in the Big West Media Preseason Poll, Santa Barbara has the pieces to top the conference standings and end the year ahead of preseason favorite, UC Irvine.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The team will center around Williams, the 2014 Big West Player of the Year. He is predicted to repeat his performance of last season when he averaged 21.3 points per game, 11.5 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots per game, one of the best statistical seasons of last year.</p>\n<p>Williams was recently ranked as the No. 29 college basketball player in the country by ESPN and his inside presence and offensive efficiency is the reason why. Last year, Big Al took the fourth-most shots in the nation, taking 37.2 percent of UCSB’s shots and still averaged a 57 percent shooting percentage from the field.</p>\n<p>His strength in the paint and hustle crashing the glass make Williams one of the best players in any conference. Now in his final opportunity to reach the NCAA tournament, the big man is poised for another big season.</p>\n<p>Williams’ production is a given, but perhaps a greater indication of the Gauchos’ success this year will ride on his teammates’ play. UCSB returns four starters from last season including junior guard Michael Bryson, whose three-point shot gives the Gauchos a perimeter threat. Bryson was second on the team last year at three-point shots made with 55.</p>\n<p>At the point, the Gauchos have one of the best ball handlers in the conference in senior Zalmico Harmon. In his first season with UCSB, Harmon averaged 5.1 assists per game, second in the Big West. More impressively, he ranked second in the nation in assist-to-turnover ratio at 4.6-to-1.0.</p>\n<p>With the return of junior guard T.J. Taylor and junior forward John Green from injury, the Gauchos also have depth at the bench. Taylor returns after having missed all of last season due to hip surgeries; before last year, he started 33 games at the point. Green, who has only played four games in three seasons because of injuries, brings athleticism for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara does not officially begin the season until Nov. 14 when it travels to take on college basketball powerhouse, No. 5 Kansas, the Gauchos still have to face Point Loma first.</p>\n<p>Point Loma, located in San Diego, is in its first season as a member of the NCAA, competing in Division II. In their first preseason game against San Diego State, the Sea Lions lost 74-45, as only one player on the team scored over six points in the contest.</p>\n<p>Tip-off for tonight’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58098\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/new-season-brings-championship-aspirations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58098\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/new-season-brings-championship-aspirations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/new-season-brings-championship-aspirations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/new-season-brings-championship-aspirations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-10/new-season-brings-championship-aspirations/","id":489,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[488,487,486],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Night of Magic: Magic Johnson Tells All at the Arlington","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"NBA Hall of Famer and entrepreneur Magic Johnson visited Santa Barbara for a talk on the art of winning.

So I wasn’t afraid to say I needed to work on some things to get better.”</p>\n<p>Having been one of the earliest public figures to come out as being diagnosed with HIV, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV education since his retirement in 1991. At his talk, Johnson took a brief moment to address practicing safe sex and his contributions to raising awareness on the issue, noting having raised over 15 million dollars for the cause through his Magic Johnson Foundation.</p>\n<p>Now a part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Magic recounted getting his feet wet in business, first by opening Magic Johnson Theatres, a chain of movie theaters that served urban communities. He followed that up by securing a deal with Starbucks, where he expanded business operations to urban areas, eventually selling 125 stores back to Starbucks after a successful partnership.</p>\n<p>“What did that give me? The track record of success among everybody across the nation that Magic was a serious businessman,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Johnson, whose charisma and personality helped revitalize the NBA during the 1980’s and led him to become a superstar outside of the sports world, took time during his presentation to interact with audience members, take photos and offer humorous anecdotes of his playing days.</p>\n<p>After Magic finished his talk, handwritten questions from audience members were selected for a Q&amp;A. A wide range of questions was presented during the session where Magic talked openly on each subject.</p>\n<p>When asked about the NBA’s handling of the Donald Sterling incident, Johnson reiterated his support of the league banning Sterling from the NBA, saying there is no place for racism in the NBA or in society.</p>\n<p>Other viewpoints expressed by Magic during the Q&amp;A session included criticism of the Lakers for not hiring coach Phil Jackson during the 2012-2013 season, supporting a two year requirement for college basketball players before being eligible for the NBA Draft and the need for entrepreneurs of color to help other minority business people.</p>\n<p>Before ending his talk, Magic offered one final piece of advice for everyone in the audience on his key to success.</p>\n<p>“I want you to over-deliver to everybody, your parents, your professor,” Johnson said. “That’s what we all have to do now. It’s not enough in the marketplace just to deliver anymore. You have to over-deliver, and then you’ll get the retention you’re looking for.”</p>\n<p>This is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57412\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/a-night-with-magic-johnson/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57412\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/a-night-with-magic-johnson/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/a-night-with-magic-johnson/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/a-night-with-magic-johnson/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/a-night-with-magic-johnson/","id":496,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[495,494,493],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brazil’s Neymar Relishing the Pressure","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The fate of the Brazilian national soccer team lies on the foot of 22-year-old Neymar.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With the weight of an entire nation on his shoulders, Brazilian Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior has delivered for the host nation in the World Cup. All eyes were on him entering the biggest event in sports, and Neymar has delivered. At only 22 years old, the forward has carried the team into the round of 16 and is the current leader in goals scored in the tournament with a total of four.</p>\n<p>In Monday’s match against Cameroon, Neymar snuck past the defense and scored in the 17th minute, converting on a beautifully delivered cross in the middle of the box. It was not an easy finish, but a player of his quality, Neymar knew exactly where to slot the ball past the goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>His second goal against the Cameroonians showed how lethal he can be. Neymar ran straight into the heart of the defense and shot with his right foot, putting the ball in the back of the net on a goal near post. To put into perspective how important Neymar has been to this Brazilian side, Brazil has scored seven goals in the tournament and four of them have come off the boot of Neymar. Without him, things may not be going so well for the Seleção in the group stage.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>His goals gave his side first place in Group A as Brazil now prepares to play South American foe Chile in the knockout stages. But the tournament means a lot more for the country of Brazil than just soccer. Soccer has been Brazil’s way of proving itself to the rest of the world, giving more pressure for this team to win the World Cup.</p>\n<p>With protests surrounding the event before it even began because of stadium workers demanding better working conditions, and controversy as to whether the billions of dollars invested into the World Cup should be spent on helping relieve poverty in the country, perhaps no other team has needed to win so much upon entering the tournament.</p>\n<p>For Brazilians, this World Cup’s success is contingent on how well the national team performs, and anything less than a championship would bring down the hopes of an entire country. As the Brazilian national team goes, so do the people of Brazil.</p>\n<p>That makes what Neymar has done even more impressive. In his first season playing with European soccer giant F.C. Barcelona, the forward had nine goals in 26 appearances for the club. However, it is when he puts on the yellow jersey that his similarities to Argentina’s Lionel Messi or Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo are really seen. With 35 goals scored in 52 appearances, he already ranks sixth for most goals scored for Brazil, ahead of other legendary Brazilian players such as Ronaldinho de Assis Moreira and Romário de Souza Faria.</p>\n<p>In last year’s Confederations Cup, he was elected as the tournament’s best player and scored four goals in five games. It was a preview to what we are seeing now. Clearly, Neymar has a knack to deliver when his country needs him the most.</p>\n<p>Although he is only 22 years old, he shows the maturity of a savvy veteran when he steps onto the pitch. His acceleration and pace allow him to separate from defenders, but his dribbling and creativity on the ball is what puts him in such an elite category. He is a master with the ball and has the potential to be the greatest player in the world. He shines most when the pressure is on.</p>\n<p>Although Brazil easily dispatched opponents Croatia and Cameroon, it was a shaky performance from the team as a whole. The team’s backline at times looked flustered and it could prove costly from now on. Brazil’s defenders have a tendency of pushing too much into the attack, leaving holes for opponents to exploit.</p>\n<p>That could be a problem against Chile, who has players such as Arturo Vidal who is deadly in open space. Aside from that, Chile is  firing from all cylinders, as demonstrated when they eliminated defending champions Spain.</p>\n<p>So can an entire team win the World Cup behind only one player? In the 1986 World Cup, Argentina lifted the trophy on the sole efforts of Diego Maradona, arguably the best soccer player of all time. Now the same question must be asked of Neymar.  Ultimately, it will need to be a team effort for Brazil to win. However, Brazil will thrive as long as Neymar does.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared in June 24, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55855\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55855\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-06-25/brazils-neymar-relishing-the-pressure/","id":2030,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[2029,2028,2027],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season On The Line","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_Brock2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_Brock2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Plays in Its Final Regular Season Series Against UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Beginning today, the UCSB baseball team will cap off its 2014 regular season campaign when it goes on the road to face UC Davis in a must-win series.

UCSB will have to sneak its way in by earning an at-large berth where the selection committee will decide UCSB’s season based on factors such as the team’s strength of schedule and wins against top opponents.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to focus on the process of playing good baseball,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “We got away from that; we looked at the scoreboard standings more than we should have.”</p>\n<p>For teams on the bubble such as the Gauchos, earning an RPI that lands within the top 45 in the nation increases the likelihood of the team qualifying.  As of now, UCSB has an RPI of 57, six spots ahead of where it was last week.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, however, is familiar with late-season pressure. Last year, the Gauchos were in a similar circumstance and needed to sweep their final series to earn a spot in the field. UCSB did just that and found a spot in the postseason for the first time since 2001. Yet, that team finished 17-10 in conference while this year’s squad can best hope for an even Big West mark with a sweep.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need everything to go its way against the Aggies, beginning with starting pitching. In its last two weekend series, Santa Barbara has found success with sophomore Justin Jacome and junior Austin Pettibone on the mound.</p>\n<p>In Jacome’s last two starts he has allowed only two earned runs and increased his innings pitched to 72.1 on the season, the most on the staff. Meanwhile, Pettibone has been even more dominant than Jacome in his last two outings. The ace of the staff has thrown two complete-game shutouts, striking out a combined 15 batters and allowing only nine hits.</p>\n<p>Where the Gauchos have struggled recently is finding a quality third starting pitcher to throw in the third game of the series. On the last two occasions, UCSB has failed to win Sunday games when taking the first two games. Those losses have consisted of the Gauchos struggling to recover from early deficits caused by a lack of quality pitching.</p>\n<p>While the starters will dictate the early-to-mid innings of the game, the bullpen will be just as valuable to secure wins in late-game situations. Sophomore closer Dillon Tate has been UCSB’s go-to pitcher during crunch time. Tate has 11 saves on the season, second in the Big West, and leads the conference with a 0.87 ERA.</p>\n<p>“I just kept working every day,” Tate said. “I was just trying to get better and do something that would benefit me and help my team out.”</p>\n<p>On paper, the Gauchos seem to overwhelm the Aggies on offense, given that UCD has the worst ERA in the league at 4.46. As a staff, Davis has given up the most earned runs and walks in the Big West, with 218 and 211, respectively. With Santa Barbara hitting a collective .286, the team will attempt to get on the board fast.</p>\n<p>First pitch today is scheduled for 2:30 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of May 22, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55467\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55467\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/season-on-the-line/","id":4152,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4151,4150,4149],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Santa Barbara Plans For Next Year With New Recruiting Class","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-06.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-06.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB could potentially bring in as many as 13 recruits for next season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>As the UCSB baseball team’s season winds down, Head Coach Andrew Checketts is already making moves heading into next year.

Carter throws a fastball that clocks in as high as early 90’s MPH and can control the strike zone.</p>\n<p>Clements went a combined 20-2 his last two years in high school and comes in with an above average changeup, coupled with excellent command of the strike zone.</p>\n<p>“[Clements’] won a ton of games, struck out a lot of hitters, pounds the strike zone,” Checketts said. “He has the ability to be a starter … He can come in and do something immediately.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has power lined up in the form of 6’5’’, 240-pound first baseman Austin Bush. The left-handed batter will need to work on decreasing his hit-or-miss approach at the plate, but the slugger’s frame can provide a homerun threat in the middle of the lineup for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Power is really hard to find in college baseball, there’s just not a lot of guys that hit two words,” says Checketts. “He’s athletic and can feel his position for a big guy. He’s got a chance to come in to compete for the first base job immediately.”</p>\n<p>Another player with the same frame as Bush is right-handed pitcher Austyn Willis out of Barstow High. The speed on his fastball can reach the upper 80’s. In his final year in high school, Willis made 11 appearances and had a 2.85 ERA.</p>\n<p>UCSB has also recruited from within Santa Barbara with the addition of Santa Barbara City College’s Patrick O’Brien. In 35 games played for SBCC, the catcher hit .299 and had 27 runs to go along with 13 RBI. With current starting catcher Jackson Morrow set to graduate, O’Brien’s experience puts him in position to start right away and fill the hole left by Morrow.</p>\n<p>Shane Mardirosian from Martin Luther King High School in Riverside is another potential player for UCSB. The infielder’s elite speed and bat speed makes him a lock to get drafted, says Checketts. Depending how high Mardirosian gets selected will decide if he plays for the Gauchos come next season.</p>\n<p>As of now, the Gauchos are saying goodbye to four seniors from this year’s team, including left fielder Joey Epperson, who has arguably been the best hitter in the lineup for UCSB this season. However, the team has built a strong recruiting class that could contribute to a Big West title next year for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 22, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55464\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55464\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-22/santa-barbara-plans-for-next-year-with-new-recruiting-class/","id":4434,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4433,4432,4431],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Heat Superstar-Trio Still Has Lots to Prove","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/14-5-19.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Mark Salay discusses why the Heat don't measure up with the NBA's greatest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Eight wins.

With three titles, that puts them in the same playing field as Kobe and Shaq’s Lakers, Tim Duncan and Tony Parker’s Spurs and Larry Bird’s great Celtics teams. Those teams won three titles each.</p>\n<p>However, for the Heat to enter the upper echelon of dynasties would mean equating them with teams that revolutionized the game. Bill Russell’s Celtics, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s Lakers and Michael Jordan’s Bulls all fall under this elite category. The Minneapolis Lakers of the early 1950s led by George Mikan also deserves a spot in this class.</p>\n<p>Consider that these teams all won at least four titles, played against formidable competition and dominated the game.</p>\n<p>Jordan three-peated twice and if he hadn’t decided to take a two-year break from the game, the Bulls would most likely have won eight straight titles.</p>\n<p>Not only did Chicago win each time they reached the Finals, none of the series were pushed to a game seven. LeBron and Co. lost in their first appearance and if it wasn’t for an incredibly clutch three-point shot from</p>\n<p>Ray Allen, last year’s Finals wouldn’t even have gone to a deciding game seven.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the topic of who Miami has faced in the championship round. In 2012, the Heat played against a young and inexperienced Oklahoma City squad that was not ready to take the crown just yet.</p>\n<p>Last year, a game seven proved to be too much for an aging Spurs team. Going against Kevin Durant before this year or Duncan past his prime does not cut it when talking about all-time great dynasties.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Showtime Lakers had to go through the legendary Celtics teams led by Bird. Those games pitted two opponents who had the same caliber of talent and saved the NBA from going extinct. The</p>\n<p>Johnson-Bird rivalry increased interest of the NBA and brought a new generation of fans to the game.</p>\n<p>Russell had his own rival in Wilt Chamberlain and Jordan went toe-to-toe with the two-headed monster of Karl Malone and John Stockton twice. James is the best player in the league, but there is no equivalent for him to prove his mettle.</p>\n<p>The Heat are also not on par with the dominance achieved with teams that came before. Minneapolis, the league’s first dynasty, won five championships in six years. Boston failed to win a title just once during the 1960s. That ladies and gentlemen, is dominance. The Heat are good, but not that good.</p>\n<p>And if you had to pick one coach to draw up the last play with the game on the line, would you have Erik Spoelstra design the play, or hand things over to Red Auerbach or Phil Jackson? The championship rings on those coach’s fingers can answer that question. Auerbach won nine times and Jackson ran out of fingers to show off his rings.</p>\n<p>If the Heat win it this year they deserve to be ranked higher than other mini-dynasties such as the Houston Rockets of the mid 1990s or the Detroit Pistons of the Bad Boy era. Their name probably is on the same plateau as Bird’s Celtics and Kobe and Shaq’s L.A. teams. However, to enter legendary status and be considered the greatest, Miami will have to win, “not three, not four, not six, not seven.” Only time will tell if that happens.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 21, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55447\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55447\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/heat-superstar-trio-still-has-lots-to-prove/","id":524,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[523,522,521],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Win Series At San Francisco","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-13.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-13.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After going 2-1 against USF, the Gauchos clinched the program’s best non-conference win percentage in a single season by improving to 22-5-1 in non-conference games.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the second consecutive weekend, the UCSB baseball team entered its series finale against the University of San Francisco with a chance to sweep, yet, after digging itself into an early deficit, the team once again failed to win its final game of the series, losing yesterday by a score of 8-4.</p>\n<p>After Sunday’s loss, the Gauchos’ record stands at 31-17-1 and 9-12 in Big West.

Pettibone went the distance to improve his record to 4-1 on the year, giving up only five hits, a walk and striking out a season-high 10 batters.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara manufactured two runs in the first inning by way of stolen bases and singles. After senior left fielder Joey Epperson got on board via hit by pitch, he stole second base and scored on a RBI hit by sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic. Nesovic later advanced to scoring position and came home on a base hit by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa.</p>\n<p>While Pettibone cruised past USF’s lineup, the Gauchos tacked on one more run in the fourth inning to push their lead to 3-0. Junior right fielder Scott Quinlan advanced to third base by stealing two bases after he singled and scored on a RBI groundout by junior second baseman Woody Woodward.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos scored one more run in the sixth on a RBI single by sophomore utility Devon Gradford, and twice again in the eighth to complete the 6-0 route.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara had a hot start to the series opener on Friday and never looked back, winning 10-4. In the first inning with runners on the corners, Nesovic came up to bat and singled to score Epperson from third base. An error by USF scored another run for the Gauchos to extend their lead to 2-0.</p>\n<p>UCSB went on to score three more runs in the second inning by converting on its bases loaded opportunity. With a runner on each base, the Gauchos’ first run of the frame came by way of pass ball. Nesovic then followed with a bases clearing double that scored two additional runs. Santa Barbara came out of the inning leading by five runs.</p>\n<p>USF earned a run in the third inning off of sophomore starting pitcher Justin Jacome, but the Dons were unable to produce any big run innings in the game. San Francisco’s biggest inning came in the fifth when it scored two runs, but Jacome kept the Dons’ offense on check. In 7.2 innings of work, Jacome limited USF to just six hits and struck out four on his way to picking up his seventh win on the year, the most on the staff.</p>\n<p>UCSB scored five more times in the game, including a homerun by Quinlan in the fifth inning, his first of the season. Quinlan’s 2-5 performance from the plate was just one of the Gauchos’ many solid hitting performances on the day. Epperson had a perfect game from the batter’s box, hitting 3-3 and walking in his three other plate appearances. Nesovic had three RBI in his four-hit game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara now awaits its final series of the season this weekend against conference opponent, UC Davis.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 19th, 2014th’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-19/gauchos-win-series-at-san-francisco/","id":4433,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4432,4431,4430],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Striving to End Strong","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-08.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsCSUN-DustinHarris-05112014-08.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Travels North to Face San Francisco in Final Non-Conference Series  ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB baseball team began the season with one of its best starts in program history.

USF came up on the losing side in each of those respective series and has won only twice in six games this year against the conference.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will need all the help it can get going into this series.</p>\n<p>After failing to defeat Pepperdine in its last game, the last opponent that could have given the Gauchos a serious résumé booster ahead of the NCAA tournament selection, UCSB must win its remaining games to have any possibility of playing in the postseason.</p>\n<p>“There’s still a shot. All is not lost,” Epperson said. “We’re certainly in a really tough place right now as far as getting into the playoff picture. We would need to sweep both these next two weekends on the road.”</p>\n<p>The sense of desperation was felt in the 12-5 loss to the Waves. In that game, Head Coach Andrew Checketts resorted to using seven different pitchers and maintained a quick leash throughout the game.</p>\n<p>As early as the first inning, Checketts began experimenting with his pitching rotation after sophomore Domenic Mazza gave up UCSB’s two-run lead despite him throwing only 14 pitches.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB was hurt by its lack of efficiency on defense. The team committed five errors in crucial parts of the game that led to runs in what was one of its most disappointing defensive performances of the season.</p>\n<p>“There’s not a lot of confidence in the guys and in our entire group,” Epperson said. “Unfortunately, we just didn’t win any aspect of the game: pitching, defense, offense. You’re not going to win any game when you’re not doing anything particularly well.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to turn things around but faces the challenge of doing it on the road. Given the Gauchos’ struggles away from home this year, playing with an 8-10 road record, the team will need to get on the board early and take advantage of scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>However, most of the losses have come against Big West opponents. Before losing to Pepperdine, UCSB had won its previous two non-conference road games.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has had productive performances from some of its players despite not winning as of late. Junior Greg Mahle has been doing double duty on the mound and from behind the plate as designated hitter.</p>\n<p>Known this season for his reliable relief pitching, Mahle has been in the lineup in four of UCSB’s last five games and is batting .414.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the bullpen, the left-hander has an ERA of 2.15 and has pitched the second-most innings on the team with 62.2.</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Peter Maris has had a breakout season for UCSB. In UCSB’s last five games, Maris batted at a .333 clip.</p>\n<p>His 2-5 hitting performance against Pepperdine was one of the bright spots for the Gauchos. The shortstop was added to the Brooks Wallace Award Watch List, one of 35 players included on the list that is given out to the nation’s best shortstop.</p>\n<p>USF will depend on junior outfielder Bradley Zimmer to knock in runs for the Dons.</p>\n<p>Zimmer recently made the 30-man cut for the Golden Spikes Award, the top honor given to the best amateur baseball player in the country.</p>\n<p>This season, Zimmer is hitting with a .366 batting average.
