Coincidentally enough, it seems that the only time this HOF quarterback doesn’t show up for the February bowl game is when he is playing against the other Manning, and luckily for him, he isn’t this time. Instead, he will be taking on a much tougher opponent in the Legion of Boom.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas and Byron Maxwell have had their share of chances to beat up offenses this season. What makes these players so special is the fact that every one of them is capable of being the best defensive player on the field in any given game.</p>\n<p>This secondary is easily the best in football, but they have experienced some hiccups along the road. Where they seem to struggle is on the long balls, but luckily for them, that is something that Brady does not do very often. What the Legion of Boom covers best is any pass that’s in front of them, so if they can do what they do best for just one more game, they will add back-to-back champs to their résumé.</p>\n<p>We have seen the Seahawks tear apart limb from limb every elite quarterback with the exception of one: Thomas Edward Brady. This man is going into his sixth Bowl with the same franchise and head coach he’s had his whole career, and I highly doubt that he is looking to lose his third straight.</p>\n<p>If there is anyone in this league that can break up this strong defense, then it is definitely Brady. Unfortunately, the Patriots have just about the worst receiving core in the league besides Seattle, which doesn’t give him many options besides tight end Rob Gronkowski, his best receiver.</p>\n<p>Regardless of having nobody to pass to except Brandon Lafell and Danny Amendola, this QB has still gotten his usual passing number and has once again taken his offense to the last game of the season.  He has defeated top passing defenses this year like Cincinnati, Denver, Indianapolis and Buffalo twice. Rumors have it that injuries may affect both Sherman and Thomas and it is almost a guarantee that Brady will look to expose them on Sunday. It takes a madman to bet against this QB/Head Coaching duo.</p>\n<p>Defenses do win championships, but legendary players conquer all.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Patriots</p>\n<p><strong>Russell Wilson vs. Patriots Secondary</strong> by Sean White</p>\n<p>After an undoubtedly heroic performance in the Seattle Seahawks’ triumphant 28-22 comeback win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship, quarterback Russell Wilson is just one win away from leading his team to another Super Bowl victory.</p>\n<p>But he must first find a way to surpass a New England Patriots secondary that has been playing lockdown defense since the postseason began. In just two playoff games, the Patriots have a total of four interceptions and even held the Indianapolis Colts’ quarterback Andrew Luck to just 126 passing yards in the AFC Championship.</p>\n<p>With arguably one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL in Darrelle Revis, the Patriots automatically have an advantage coming into Sunday’s matchup. His ability to isolate and remove wide receivers from games by placing them on “Revis Island” can take away from a quarterback’s passing.</p>\n<p>Additionally, former Seahawk and “Legion of Boom” member Brandon Browner may be able to inform New England’s secondary with some insight on how to contain Russell Wilson.</p>\n<p>Although the Patriots may be able to limit Wilson’s amount of pass completions, they must be able to stop him outside of the pocket. His capability to scramble and make plays under pressure may be the most underrated aspect of this game. Wilson’s dual-threat skill set is what will allow the Seahawks to repeat as NFL champions. Expect a Seattle win as he proves yet again why he is so “DangerRuss.”</p>\n<p>Advantage: Seahawks</p>\n<p><strong>Bill Belichick vs. Pete Carroll</strong> by Sarah Stigers</p>\n<p>Trying to debate whether Bill Belichick or Pete Carroll will fare better in the Super Bowl is much like debating which is the lesser of two evils in my book, because if you are not a Patriots or Seahawks fan, you probably are not too fond of either team.</p>\n<p>However, putting personal preferences aside, these two teams got to the Super Bowl because they rely on those two evils — and ultimately, it was coaching that elevated both teams to Championship level.</p>\n<p>Let’s start this off by saying my money is on the Seahawks. Pete Carroll and the gang are coming off of an emotional victory over the Packers in the NFC Championship game. I think that any team will have a hard time upsetting that game flow, but I think if someone is going to give it a shot, it is going to be Belichick.</p>\n<p>Based on pure statistics in the NFL, there’s no questioning that the football genius that lies within Belichick’s brain is incredible, with three Super Bowl titles, six conference championships and 14 divisional championships. None of that, however, discredits the decoration Carroll received while he ran the USC empire.</p>\n<p>Carroll had nine years coaching in college football and emerged from his legacy with a .836 win percentage, on top of a 7-2 Bowl game record. Ignoring his short stint with, ironically, the Patriots in the late 90s, since his re-entry into the NFL in 2010, he already has one Super Bowl title with the Legion of Boom.</p>\n<p>I think the deeper team going into Sunday is the Patriots, and it is obvious that Belichick knows exactly how to play his stars in every aspect that he can. Belichick is no stranger to a strong defense, and he runs a tight special teams. Those two aspects are what win Super Bowls.</p>\n<p>It is very rare that a team can win two straight titles, and when it comes down to coaching, Carroll is a man that craves a legacy no matter where it takes him, whereas Belichick is a coach that will stick to his team.</p>\n<p>Where usually the latter mindset is what drives a team to be a cohesive and well-oiled machine, in this situation, I think the Pats know that this Super Bowl is not the end for them. They still have the legs to go for a few more years. Quarterback Tom Brady is a monster and Gronkowsi’s youth keeps the team fresh. The Patriots will simply not stop being good after this game.</p>\n<p>Though I cannot say this with certainty, I truly believe that same statement does not go for the Seahawks. This Super Bowl is Seattle’s chance of going down in history. I think Carroll will chase that dream through Sunday night and do everything it takes to achieve that goal.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Seahawks</p>\n<p><strong>Marshawn Lynch vs. Patriots Run Defense</strong> by Martin Cobos</p>\n<p>Marshawn Lynch may be a man of few words, but his polarizing running style has been the topic of conversation since he entered the league in 2007.</p>\n<p>“Beast Mode,” as he is known around Seattle, has perfected the art of letting his performance do the talking. So in true Marshawn fashion, we shall leave the hype alone and simply let statistics tell the story.</p>\n<p>Lynch is widely known as one of the most powerful running backs in the game today and for good reason. This season, he broke an NFL leading 109 tackles. Compare this to DeMarco Murray who finished in second place with 38 fewer broken tackles despite 117 more attempts.</p>\n<p>This bruising style of running helped Lynch lead the league in yards up the the middle this season. When Lynch is able to get at least 20 carries or break off a 20-yard run, the Seahawks are 24 games over .500. When neither of these instances occurs, the Seahawks are a mere one game over .500.</p>\n<p>On the opposite side of the ball, the Patriots have vastly improved their run defense this season. In 2013, the Patriots allowed a staggering 134.1 rushing yards per game, which ranked 30th in the league.</p>\n<p>This year, however, they rank in the top ten of the league, allowing just 104.3 rushing yards per game. The Patriots have carried their tough run defense into the playoffs as they have allowed only one rushing touchdown and have not let an opponent break off a 20-yard run this postseason. The Seahawks surely hold the advantage in this matchup with one of the most prolific running backs in the game, but the Patriots’ enhanced run defense will not go down without a fight.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Seahawks</p>\n<p><strong>Rob Gronkowski vs. Kam Chancellor</strong> by Mark Salay</p>\n<p>Tight end Rob Gronkowski is the Patriots’ biggest threat in the passing game and the amount of times New England can get him involved will be critical for the passing game. Gronkowski is such a big, physical player (6’6”, 265 lbs.), he uses his frame to beat defenders to the ball.</p>\n<p>Seattle’s strong safety Kam Chancellor, however, matches up well with Gronk and will be the one in charge of containing him. Chancellor, listed at 6’3”, 232 lbs., is just as physical and big to keep up with the tight end.</p>\n<p>One thing Chancellor absolutely needs to do to win this matchup is stop Gronkowski at the line of scrimmage, because he is such a force in the open field and Tom Brady will definitely find him.</p>\n<p>If the Patriots get to the red zone, then Chancellor will also have to take away the slant route New England uses to target its playing-making tight end.<br>\nGronkowski will get his looks, but Kam needs to win the majority of the battles for Seattle to gain the upper hand. So who will come up on top? Well, we’ll see soon enough.</p>\n<p>Advantage: Toss-up</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on pages 10 and 11 of January 29, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

as the team to beat in the Big West during this week’s road trip to the league’s top two teams, first to UC Davis tonight, followed by a game against UC Irvine Saturday.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters this week’s play on a two-game winning streak at 10-9 overall and 3-2 in conference play. By establishing some needed momentum at home with wins against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton, UCSB proved it could win without its best player in senior center Alan Williams, who did not play because of a shoulder injury.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will most likely be without Big Al again this week, which gives another opportunity for UCSB’s supporting cast to step up. So far in Williams’ absence, junior guard Michael Bryson has delivered some of his best basketball of the season. He led the team in points in the last game played with 23 and was really aggressive from the field.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UC Davis hosts the Gauchos in an unfamiliar position. At 14-4 overall and 4-1 in conference, the Aggies are tied for first place in the Big West. If you want to know just how much improved Davis is, UCD won a total of four games in conference all of last year. The wins have also come against top Big West competition, versus Long Beach State in overtime and Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>A big reason why Davis is in top position is because of senior guard Corey Hawkins. Hawkins is the leading scorer in the league right now with 20.8 points per game. His 51 percent shooting from three tops the Big West. Hawkins, selected to the Big West preseason all-conference team, is UCD’s playmaker with a team-high 3.7 assists and 5.4 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Aside from Hawkins, senior guard Josh Ritchart is another possible scoring option for the Aggies. Ritchart scores in double figures with 11.7 points per game and shoots a solid 41.9 percent from three.</p>\n<p>For UCSB to win against the Aggies, junior forward John Green will need another performance like he had last week. Green earned his first conference player of the week award after getting his first career double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Green needs to be a factor on the boards again for UCSB, especially without Williams in the paint.</p>\n<p>Junior forwards Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler also need to contribute to what Big Al usually contributes as well.</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Thursday’s game is set for 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

team’s 68-49 win Saturday against Cal State Fullerton at the Thunderdome. Despite playing without two of their best scorers, the Gauchos leaned on junior guard Michael Bryson’s game-high 23 points to earn their second win of the week.</p>\n<p>The victory gets UCSB back on track after coming off possibly its worst week of basketball in the season with losses to Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State. However, with this week’s sweep over UC Riverside and Fullerton, the Gauchos improve to 10-9 overall and 3-2 in Big West. Fullerton continues winless in conference at 0-5 and 8-12 overall.</p>\n<p>It was Bryson who carried the load offensively for the Gauchos. Still without the team’s leading scorer in senior center Alan Williams (shoulder injury), Bryson looked for his shot right from the start, knocking down half of his 16 shot attempts, while making all of his four free throws to make him the program’s leader in most consecutive free throws made with 34.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I think I’ve gotten to a pretty good rhythm right now,” Bryson said. “I know when to take my shots at this point. Now I just got to make sure I knock down a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Eric Childress delivered a solid game, totaling a career-high 11 points, five rebounds and four assists in the absence of freshman guard Gabe Vincent, who was out due to illness.</p>\n<p>“I’m really pleased with how they responded to getting their opportunity,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Hopefully it gives them confidence and grow from here … You’re seeing the byproduct of a kid like Eric stepping up when he’s had to the last two games.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard John Green made the first seven points for Santa Barbara and finished with 15. His work on the glass really gave the team the advantage; Green’s 10 rebounds gave him his first career double-double and came at the heels of him grabbing only 11 combined boards his previous three games.</p>\n<p>“You have to make up for the ways Alan contributes to the team,” Green said. “My whole focus was to rebound more because the last couple of games in the conference I wasn’t rebounding a lot, so coaches really have been telling me to focus on rebounding and playing my game, which is really going to take me to the next level.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton had its first halftime lead of the conference season, leading 36-31. UCSB began to take control of the second half after a 19-0 run that gave the Gauchos a decisive 52-40 lead with 10 minutes left.</p>\n<p>For CSUF, the league’s fifth leading scorer coming into the game, senior guard Alex Harris, was kept in check for only four points. After shooting 46 percent in the first half, the Titans managed to only nail 13 percent of their shots in the second.</p>\n<p>“They came out 6-13 [shooting from three-point range]. In the second half they’re going to start to cool down, they’re going to start to fatigue,” Green said. “Just as long as we contest shots and play good defense, they’re not going to fall, which was what happened in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara goes on the road now for its first two-game conference road trip.

Meanwhile, Riverside falls to 9-10 and 2-3 in league, having won only one game on the road.</p>\n<p>It was a trio of juniors that got the job done for UCSB. Along with Brewe, guard John Green also scored a career-high in points with 21, adding nine rebounds. Guard Michael Bryson, after scoring no points the previous game, came out shooting to start and finished with 16 points on 7-12 from the field.</p>\n<p>“I thought our junior class was excellent. They competed, made plays, made shots,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They played with aggression, they went after rebounds. They played the way they were capable of playing, which was really good to see.”</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 51 percent for the game, primarily because the Gauchos made an emphasis on scoring in the low post, punishing the Highlanders 32-18 in the paint. UCR was tied with the Gauchos going into halftime, in large part because of its eight threes made from the perimeter.</p>\n<p>However, the hot shooting did not translate into the second half for the Highlanders, while UCSB remained aggressive for the duration of the game.</p>\n<p>“We challenged them well before Al went down, that they have to be more assertive than they were last week,” Coach Williams said. “I’m happiest about how we came out and competed. We played more aggressive, we went at the rim, we did things you got to do in a basketball game.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was a major advantage for the Gauchos. Although not apparent on the stat sheet, senior guard Zalmico Harmon had a standout performance, delivering the ball to the right man and orchestrating the offense for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Sophomore Eric Childress again proved to be a valuable asset off the bench; his eight rebounds were a career-high and his eight points were the most he has scored so far in the season.</p>\n<p>“Seeing [Childress get eight rebounds] just tells you how aggressive he was offensively and defensively,” Bryson said. “He read the passing lanes and played a great game.”</p>\n<p>For UC Riverside, junior guard Jaylen Bland led the team with 21 points and senior guard Austin Quick gave the Highlanders a lift off the bench, going 4-7 from the field to finish with 13 points.</p>\n<p>UCSB now waits until Saturday to play Cal State Fullerton at home.

For him to be cleared to play, swelling must come down along with getting range of motion back, and gaining strength to the area.</p>\n<p>Last week, the Gauchos got a glimpse of what life without Williams would look like as he was bothered by the flu, resulting in an underwhelming performance from the rest of his teammates. Now with no Big Al whatsoever, a total team effort will be needed to fend off a dangerous UCR team.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We should have been better able to handle [Big Al] being under the weather,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “Now we will find out if we can flat play without him because we will not even have a [sick] Al Williams, we will have no Al Williams.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is 8-9 overall and 1-2 in conference after suffering a road loss at Long Beach State. In that game, UCSB shot a miserable 25 percent from the field and at one point, missed 25 of 27 attempts. Already having suffered a loss to Cal State Northridge two days before, consecutive losses place the Gauchos in seventh place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Riverside comes in 9-9 overall and 2-2 in league after last week’s split at home, fourth in league.</p>\n<p>To make up for Big Al’s spot in the starting lineup, junior forward Sam Beeler will start in place along with junior guard John Green, while junior forward Mitch Brewe will be relegated to the bench. UCSB will need to count on Green, freshman Gabe Vincent and junior guard Michael Bryson — the team’s shooters — to provide the offense Williams normally provides.</p>\n<p>“We will run only things that we feel benefit that group,” Coach Williams said. “A lot of stuff we run and plays we run, are built around playing for Al, and so now we’re not going to have Al so, it opens up more room for others to penetrate. We’re going to have to hit jump shots no doubt.”</p>\n<p>For UCSB to pick things up offensively, Bryson will have to shake off his performance from his two previous games. It was Bryson who catapulted the Gauchos to a win in their conference opener against Cal Poly, but versus CSUN and Long Beach, he combined for a total of eight points, not scoring at all against the 49ers.</p>\n<p>“He’s one of the guys we’re challenging,” Coach Williams said. “There are a lot of options for him to get involved. Number one thing is you play harder, be more aggressive, make more things happen.”</p>\n<p>Bryson could get the hot hand this weekend as UCR is ranked fifth in the Big West in points allowed.</p>\n<p>The Highlanders will counter with junior forward Taylor Johns, who is second in the league in rebounds with 8.4. Johns is a player quick off the bounce and has expanded his game with a perimeter shot. He could be a problem for Green and Brewe because of his quickness.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of January 21, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59981\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59981\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/big-al-out-indefinitely-ucsb-hosts-riverside/","id":456,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[455,454,453],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Loses First Conference Game Versus CSUN","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"CSUN shot 56 percent from the field to defeat UCSB men's basketball last night, 74-63.

For UCSB, the loss is reminiscent of last season, when the Gauchos also lost their conference home opener against Cal Poly, resulting in the team losing out on the No. 1 seed in the league tournament.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, CSUN picks up its first win of conference season after losing its previous two games and improves to 5-13 overall and 1-2 in league. Santa Barbara understood the Matadors’ record was not indicative of the team’s talent, and experienced it firsthand.</p>\n<p>“I think talent wise they’re really good. They have four starters back from a team that lost in the Big West Championship last year,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “… If you overlook them, you’re crazy. So, as a coaching staff we did not overlook them. They’re a scary team.”</p>\n<p>What made the game even more difficult for UCSB was it was virtually without its best player in senior center Alan Williams. Williams came down with the flu prior to the game and it was apparent that he was not his usual self, as he did not possess the energetic dynamic he often brings.</p>\n<p>“It was a tough night for sure. I’m not exactly sure how [Williams] is feeling,” freshman guard Gabe Vincent said. “It’s tough to play sick, but he came out here and battled.”</p>\n<p>Williams finished with five points and seven rebounds, both a season-low. With Big Al only on the floor for 25 minutes, the Gauchos were severely undersized and outrebounded 34-23. Already a very tall team, CSUN used its height and athleticism to outmatch the Gauchos on both sides of the ball.</p>\n<p>“Hicks, Maxwell and [Elliot] were pretty relentless on crashing the glass,” Harmon said. “Sometimes we didn’t block out and release … They are relentless athletes so they went out and got it.”</p>\n<p>After trimming the lead to five with a little over three minutes left, UCSB could not stop the Matadors from penetrating to the basket or hitting jumpers, and Northridge used the little time remaining to its advantage.</p>\n<p>For Santa Barbara, Vincent led the way in points with 15. In the first half, Vincent nailed three treys to keep UCSB within striking distance, leaving the Gauchos down 35-32 going into halftime.</p>\n<p>Northridge’s senior guard Stephan Hicks added 17 points and despite getting only six rebounds, CSUN’s best player in senior forward Stephen Maxwell, was a factor in the game.</p>\n<p>The only other player in double digits for UCSB was Harmon, who finished with 11 points and six assists.</p>\n<p>Now the Gauchos have the difficult task of recovering from the loss and going on the road to play Long Beach State Saturday.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game against LBSU is scheduled for 4 p.m. and will be televised on ESPN3.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

After a strong performance during the non-conference season, Williams now leads a team that is a favorite to win the Big West title for the first time in four years.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara comes into tonight’s game with an overall record of 8-7 and 1-0 in conference. With Big West play still in the beginning stages, the mindset of the Gauchos is to keep improving towards the end of the regular season, where the team wants to be playing its best basketball in preparation for the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>“I think in some aspects we’ve improved, and I think in a lot of aspects we still got a lot of work to do,” Williams said. “That’s the beauty of conference. It’s a brand new season, and it’s a brand new opportunity to continue to improve to where you’re playing your best basketball in March.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has arguably the biggest stat-sheet stuffing big man in the nation with Big Al. Williams, last season’s Big West Player of the Year and AP All-American Honorable Mention, returns once again as the best player in the conference, without a doubt.</p>\n<p>His 21.3 points per game last year ranked 12­­­­­­th in the country and third all-time in program history for a single season. His game has only improved as he is currently averaging a league-leading 12.1 rebounds and 2.3 blocks; his 17.9 points per game rank him second in the conference as well.</p>\n<p>Not only is Big Al posting monster numbers on a consistent basis, he is doing it against top-level competition. Against Kansas, he went off for 22 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks. During the Gauchos’ trip to Oregon, he poured in 26 points and 12 rebounds on the Ducks.</p>\n<p>Don’t get confused though, UCSB is more than a one-man show. Yes, the Gauchos will most likely go as far as Big Al takes them, but they can beat you with more than just one player. One of the reasons many predict the team will make the NCAA Tournament is because of the supporting cast around Williams and the talent those players bring.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Michael Bryson is an athletic player that can play above the rim and has provided a few highlight reel dunks this season. As the team’s second-leading scorer averaging 13.5 points per game, Bryson is known for his three-point shooting prowess and is an important part of the inside-out game. UCSB will need him to be consistent as there are times he can be quiet from the floor.</p>\n<p>A new face this season is freshman guard Gabe Vincent, who earned a spot in the starting lineup since the first game. Despite his class standing, Vincent plays with the edge of an experienced player and has gelled quickly with the team.</p>\n<p>Vincent has showed a lot over the course of the non-conference season, at times even taking control of the scoring duties. Against Southern Methodist University, he nailed the clutch three-point shot with seconds left to force that game into overtime.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been so high on Gabe since the day we got the commitment from him,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He was a really good recruit for us. When we got him I said he’s going to be our starting off-guard … He’s everything we thought he was going to be.”</p>\n<p>Vincent battled a blister injury that kept him out of the Great Alaska Shootout tournament earlier, but has remained healthy since and will be needed down the stretch in the off-guard position.</p>\n<p>Playing alongside Vincent in the backcourt is senior guard Zalmico Harmon. Harmon commanded the point as well as any other player last season and ended with a 4.6-to-1.0 assist-to-turnover ratio, second-best in the entire Division I. So far, Harmon leads the squad in assists with 3.9.</p>\n<p>Although he primarily looks to get his teammates involved first, Harmon is also one of the best shooters on the team and can hit the three-point shot. Against Washington State, he led the team with 17 points on 3-4 shooting from beyond the arc.<br>\nUCSB’s bench is one of the deepest in the Big West and will be a key factor.</p>\n<p>“Being to be able to come off the bench with guys that go out there and put the ball in the basket is huge,” Big Al said. “I think they’re doing a good job to maintain or trying to elevate leads, and that’s what we need them to do.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have waited three years to see junior guard John Green take the court, and it’s been worth the wait. Injuries to foot and wrist have limited Green to only four games his first three years, however, Green has avoided the injury bug this year and has contributed in immense ways.</p>\n<p>Green is a versatile scorer that can attack the defense many different ways, either by facing up to shoot, attacking the basket or hitting the three. Think of Paul Pierce when comparing his game to an NBA player. His 10.5 points per game makes him one of three Gauchos to average in double-figures and third on the team overall. Defensively, Green will be relied to provide scrappy “D” and use his length to trouble opponents.</p>\n<p>Despite being healthy, Green must now get accustomed to playing significant minutes during an entire season.</p>\n<p>“Now there’s a grind of a season that he’s never been through before,” coach Williams said. “I think he’s learning to handle the grind of a season and that he has to learn to play through fatigue, and monotony of everyday practice is a new experience for him.”</p>\n<p>Point guard is a position of depth for UCSB. Besides Harmon, the Gauchos can experiment playing junior T.J. Taylor and sophomore Eric Childress. Taylor missed out all of last season after having surgery on both hips; prior to injury, he started 33 games his first two seasons and brings experience to the one. When left open, Taylor is a threat from the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Childress is a speedy player with handles. He can get to the basket and knock down floaters or even dunk the ball. He had a stellar game last Monday against Florida Gulf Coast where he provided a huge lift off the bench with his solid overall play.</p>\n<p>Two forwards on the roster that play complementary, yet important roles are juniors Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler. Brewe starts in the front court with Big Al while Beeler plays a backup role to Williams.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter Big West play battle-tested, playing the 22nd hardest schedule in the nation before non-conference season ended . UCSB’s first game of the year was against then-No. 5 Kansas on the road. In front of a raucous crowd, the Gauchos went neck-and-neck with the Jayhawks and were down by two points midway through the second half before eventually losing.</p>\n<p>UCSB then travelled for the Great Alaska Shootout during the Thanksgiving break, where they finished runner-up to Colorado St. in a game that went down to the wire.</p>\n<p>The team has definitely learned from its tough schedule what it takes to win, as evident in the Gauchos victory over rival Cal Poly in their Big West opener last Saturday.</p>\n<p>Down by 10 points with seven minutes left, Santa Barbara closed the game on a 20-5 run to steal the victory from Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“The last six minutes of basketball is when we really started to make a dent to what they were doing,” Bryson said. “I think that speaks a lot about the non-conference games really just teaching us a lesson.”</p>\n<p>After tonight’s game against Cal State Northridge, the schedule doesn’t get easier for UCSB. They play Saturday on the road versus Long Beach State before returning home next week for two home games.</p>\n<p>Tonight’s home game against CSUN is scheduled for 7 p.m. with Saturday’s contest versus Long Beach beginning at 4 p.m., and will be available to view on ESPN 3.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Irvine Anteaters </strong>by Mark Salay</p>\n<p>The UC Irvine men’s basketball team was all but a lock to win the Big West last season. They entered as the No. 1 seed and poised to make the program’s first appearance in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>That dream was put on pause as the eventual league champions, Cal Poly, upset the Anteaters in the semifinals. Flash-forward to now: Irvine returns four starters and the conference’s defensive player of the year with hopes of finishing off what it couldn’t last season.</p>\n<p>UCI has been picked to win the Big West again, but has split two games to start conference, losing to Long Beach State and cruising to an easy win versus UC Riverside. During non-conference, UCI went 8-8.</p>\n<p>A significant reason for the team’s losses can be attributed to two key injuries in sophomore center Mamadou Ndiaye and sophomore guard Luke Nelson.<br>\nListed at 7’6”, 300 lbs., Ndiaye is the tallest active player in Division I and the conference’s reigning defensive player of the year after setting the league record for most blocks in a season with 106. His presence in the paint is enough to change the game because of his height and length (his wingspan is over 8’3”).</p>\n<p>Ndiaye has missed nine games this year, including the conference opener, but returned last Saturday against UC Riverside in a 10 point, three rebound performance. Ndiaye is not the best option on offense since his lack of coordination causes him to turn the ball over. However, he comes into the season with many facets of his game much improved.</p>\n<p>Nelson, last season’s Big West Conference Freshman of the Year, has played in only 10 games so far because of injury.</p>\n<p>He is coming off a season where he averaged 11.1 points per game and can potentially make huge strides on the offensive end when he comes back. For the Anteaters, it will be imperative for Nelson to continue improving his efficiency on that end.</p>\n<p>Playing in the backcourt alongside Nelson is junior Alex Young, Big West Conference Freshman of the Year in the year prior to Nelson. Both Nelson and Young competed for Great Britain in the European U20 Championship during the summer and had time to develop more chemistry on the floor. Together, the two form one of the strongest duos in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCI’s next game is tonight versus Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Long Beach 49ers</strong> by Sarah Stigers</p>\n<p>A rich history of Long Beach State men’s basketball is hoping to be salvaged as this year’s team attempts to climb out of its preseason hole entering Big West play this month.</p>\n<p>Starting the conference season with a 7-11 overall record, the team looks forward to a more fruitful January coming off a seven-game losing streak following in December. However, Long Beach has already won two of its three games this month, landing it the seventh seed in the Big West so far with a 1-1 record. One of the team’s losses included a one-point loss to nationally ranked San Diego State.</p>\n<p>Coming off of not only a third-place 2014 season finish, but three previously consecutive first-place conference titles in 2011, 2012 and 2013, players like senior guard Mike Caffey started to turn it on in past weeks to climb the conference ladder.</p>\n<p>Caffey is starting the Big West season off with a Big West Player of the Week award this week. He is coming off a successful 2014 campaign in which he received Big West first team recognition.</p>\n<p>Though Caffey’s recent success translated into a win over UC Irvine and a close overtime loss against UC Davis, the team is still feeling the loss of 2014 Big West honorable mention Dan Jennings. Eleven of the 18 49er players on this year’s roster are either sophomores or freshmen.</p>\n<p>Though the team’s youth may be seen as a set back, the 49ers still maintain an undefeated 4-0 record at home, but fall short on the road, only winning one of 11 road games. However, even after an up-and-down November, alternating between a win and loss every other game, half of the team’s final scores have ended in a 10-point margin — five of which ended in a Long Beach loss.</p>\n<p>Growing experience will be an important aspect of this season for the 49ers. With more time spent on the court, the young team will only get better as it adjusts to road play and learns how to finish crucial plays during those close matches, something they are showing signs of so far this January.</p>\n<p>Long Beach is currently fourth in the conference in field goal percentage, just trailing UC Santa Barbara, with a 43.6 percent average. They also fall just behind the Gauchos in three-point percentage, again ranking fourth in the conference with a 37.5 percent average.</p>\n<p>As for this past year’s Big West tournament, the 49ers entered at the third seed. During the first round quarterfinals. LBSU defeated Cal State Fullerton 66-56, but ultimately the Niners fell to CSUN in the second round semi-finals 82-77.</p>\n<p>The 49ers will play at home the next two games against Cal Poly on Thursday and UC Santa Barbara on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal Poly Mustangs </strong>by Edward Moss</p>\n<p>Coming off its unexpected berth in the 2014 NCAA Tournament, the Cal Poly men’s basketball team hopes to repeat its success and make it back to the “Big Dance” in 2015.</p>\n<p>Last season was the greatest in Mustang basketball history. The team became the first No. 7 seed to win the men’s Big West Conference Tournament, and then the team continued its run with a victory over fellow No. 16 seed Texas Southern before losing to No. 1 seed Wichita State. Last season’s success has made the team hungry to make it back to the NCAA Tournament this year.</p>\n<p>“It was our goal last year to make it to the NCAA [Tournament],” Head Coach Joe Callero said. “It helped us with recruiting and it is our goal to make it back to the ‘Dance’ this year.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs comes into today with an 8-6 record after going 7-5 in preseason games and 1-1 in conference play. Their biggest match from the preseason was a loss at the hands of No. 8 Gonzaga, 63-50. Cal Poly’s next match is tomorrow night against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>In their first game against a Big West opponent, the Mustangs defeated Hawaii 61-57 in overtime. Junior forward Brian Bennett scored a season-high 20 points to lead Cal Poly in a game where the team led by seven at halftime, but allowed Hawaii to get back into the game before winning in overtime.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly then hosted rival UCSB and lost 50-45 in a scrappy game where each team played very tough defense. Junior forward Joel Awich lead the Mustangs with 13 points, but they were not able to contain the Gauchos in the second half while attempting to switch from a zone defense to a man-to-man defense.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly prides itself on its defense and taking care of the ball well. Nationally, the squad ranks No. 1 in fewest turnovers and statistically it has the best defense in the Big West so far this season.</p>\n<p>“I’m really pleased with this team. They’re tough and they like each other,” Callero said. “We have a really good individual and team defense, but we have to be able to shoot the ball well in order to win.”</p>\n<p>With the experience this team gained from making it to the NCAA Tournament last season, the Mustangs should be included in the conversation as contenders to win the Big West again this year. With Bennett, the leading scorer in the conference thus far, Awich and junior guards David Nwaba and Reese Morgan, this squad looks formidable as conference play picks up.</p>\n<p>“The most important thing is to keep improving,” Callero said. “We are a very balanced team and we hope to improve every week and make it back to the ‘Big Dance.’”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Northridge Matadors </strong>by Daniel Moebus-Bowles</p>\n<p>Led by an experienced basketball mind in second-year Head Coach Reggie Theus, the Cal State Northridge Matadors came into Big West Conference play last weekend with a record of just 4-13 overall. They have since taken two more losses to start off conference play 0-2.</p>\n<p>The Matadors’ record, being well under .500, is not an extremely accurate representation of their strength, as they have played tough teams including then No. 16 San Diego State, No. 4 Louisville and No. 2 Arizona. Preseason Big West polls had this squad finishing fourth overall in conference with one first-place vote received as well.</p>\n<p>This team is one that clearly struggles when it is away from The Matadome with a record of 0-9 as the away team this season.</p>\n<p>The Matadors started Big West play with a pair of losses on the road to UC Davis and Hawai’i University and will end their three-game trip looking for their first road win with a matchup at Santa Barbara tomorrow. They will not be a team to pass over by any means when they return home for a four-game homestand, which should definitely boost their Big West standing.</p>\n<p>Northridge possesses an all-around team, scoring an average of 65.4 points a game and allowing just about 72.5 points. Theus runs a system that favors inside looks, which is made evident by their microscopic 9.3 3-point attempt average over the course of this season.</p>\n<p>Rather than settling for long distance shots, the Matadors’ patience on the offensive leads to more high percentage shots and it shows with their 42.4% field goal efficiency. However, they do not always get to take these good looks as they average 14.1 turnovers a game.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this is a dangerous team to face if the Matadors can find themselves in rhythm and are able to take care of the ball. On the defensive end, they allow a comparable field goal percentage as their opponents clock in around 42.8 percent and can be an exhausting team to play against as they push just over 6.4 steals and blocks every game. For this team, winning games seems to be more about not beating themselves as opposed to just beating the other team.</p>\n<p>On the court, the Matadors are led by a pair of seniors named Steve. Seniors Stephan Hicks and Stephen Maxwell top the team in scoring, dropping averages of 17.4 and 15.9 points per game. The guard-forward mix works out perfectly for Northridge as it has true threats on both parts of the offense, in a system that is designed to get high percentage looks at all costs. They are the only two players that on average take over 10 attempts a game but both of them are near or above 50 percent shooting as well with the inside and mid-range looks that they take.</p>\n<p>Maxwell serves a second purpose on the floor as well as he leads the team in rebounding, reeling in around eight boards per game. As a guard, Hicks ranks third on this list with 5.2 per game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Hawaii Rainbow Warriors </strong>by Martin Cobos</p>\n<p>As conference play begins, the University of Hawaii men’s basketball team will look to improve upon its fourth-place finish in the Big West last year.</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Warriors have been no strangers to adversity this season as the program announced in October that Head Coach Gib Arnold and Assistant Coach Brandyn Akana would be relieved of their coaching duties immediately. Assistant Coach Benjy Taylor would come to be named the interim head coach three days after the initial announcement.</p>\n<p>In Taylor’s first year as Head Coach, he has led Hawaii to an impressive non-conference record of 13-5. This marks the most non-conference victories in the school’s history and the record sits at the top of the Big West entering into conference play.</p>\n<p>“It has been a whirlwind experience for me as well as the team,” Coach Taylor said. “I got the job about a week before our first exhibition game and didn’t have the benefit of the full type of season. It was a tough transition, but we have all adjusted and responded.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii has gone 1-1 so far in conference play, losing to Cal Poly 57-61 last Wednesday in an overtime thriller before defeating Cal State University Northridge on Saturday by a score of 83-68.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly was such a tough physical game,” Coach Taylor said. “In over 20 years of coaching, I don’t think I’ve been involved in such a physical game. We are beat up, but have a young team with a short memory, so we are going to bounce back and we don’t have time to dwell on this.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii owes a large portion of its success this season to its strong physical defense. Their opponents have averaged a mere 67.3 points a game and post a shooting percentage just above .400.</p>\n<p>Hawaii also thrives off creating turnovers and forcing its opponent to make mistakes. Their opponents are averaging 17.3 turnovers per contest and Hawaii holds a turnover margin of +3.4. In addition, the Rainbow Warriors average an outstanding 9.6 steals per game.</p>\n<p>“The key to putting up this record was, for the most part, that we defended every night and played hard every night,” Taylor said. “We have struggled at times offensively, but our defense has really kept us in games.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive side of the ball, Hawaii is led by sophomore guard Aaron Valdes. Valdes has posted an average of 16.3 points per game and is shooting above .500 through 18 games this season.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Garrett Nevels is also a main contributor to Hawaii’s offensive attack. Nevels is averaging 11.4 points per game and posts a shooting percentage of .400 though 16 games. Both Nevels and Valdes average over 30 minutes per game and make up the core foundation of this Hawaii team.</p>\n<p>The key for Hawaii in conference play will be to generate offense and convert on easy looks. While Hawaii boasts a rather impressive shooting roster, missed shots from close range have hindered this offense in close games.</p>\n<p>“When you head into conference play, you have to be more in tune with personnel and scouting,” Taylor said. “You just have to be focused and we are going to have to play better offensively.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii will face UC Riverside on Saturday at 8:30 pm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Davis</strong> by Ryan Martin</p>\n<p>After posting a 28-65 record in his first three seasons at UC Davis, men’s head basketball coach Jim Les may have finally found the winning formula. The team has been phenomenal stringing together a 12-3 record to start the season.</p>\n<p>The Aggie’s also opened up Big West play by defeating Northridge and powerhouse Long Beach State to claim sole possession of first place in the conference.<br>\nUCD has talent all over the court, but this team will go only as far as senior guard Corey Hawkins takes them. Through 15 games, the 6’3” Hawkins is leading the team in scoring, rebounding, assists, and steals while shooting an uncanny 49 percent on three-pointers. Hawkins, son of former NBA All-Star Hersey Hawkins, also leads the entire Big West conference in scoring and three-point percentage, while his numbers in assists, steals, field-goal percentage, and free throw percentage all rank amongst the top five.</p>\n<p>While Hawkins has been consistently great throughout his career at Davis, the return of senior forward Josh Ritchart has proven to be crucial to the team’s success. Last year, the 6’9” Ritchart led the team in scoring and rebounding before a lower leg injury ended his season, leaving the team without a viable second option on offense. With Ritchart fully healthy and Hawkins firing on all cylinders, the Aggies have been virtually unstoppable thus far.</p>\n<p>If opponents are somehow able to subdue the one-two punch of Hawkins and Ritchart, they must then find a way to deal with junior forwards J.T. Adenrele and Josh Fox. Adenrele, the Aggie’s bona-fide rim protector, missed all of last season due to injury.</p>\n<p>As a freshman, Adenrele tied Davis’s single season record for blocked shots with 46, and his return has fortified the team’s interior defense.</p>\n<p>Fox, a transfer student from San Francisco City College, has emerged as the team’s third scoring option behind Hawkins and Ritchart. Although he is not a threat to score from distance, the 6’6” junior consistently finds ways to get to the rim, averaging 10 points per game while shooting 66 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Davis has always been able to put points on the board, but defense will be key in determining this team’s fate. With the return of Adenrele and Ritchart, it is no surprise opponents are scoring a mere 62 points per game on the Aggie’s this year, down from 72.2 last season.</p>\n<p>One area in which the Aggie’s will look to improve is playing on the road. While the team has gone undefeated at home (8-0), their play has been somewhat mediocre on the road (4-3). Following last season’s 1-13 away record, performing outside of their home confines will be a primary focus of head coach Les.</p>\n<p>For a team that has finished in last place in the Big West three out of the last four seasons, the 12-3 start may look like a fluke. But with the return of key veterans and Hawkins playing at an elite level in his final season, the Aggie’s certainly have a chance to do something special.</p>\n<p>Davis will look to remain unbeaten in the Big West Thursday, when they travel to Riverside.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>UC Riverside Highlanders </strong>by Sean White</p>\n<p>The questionable aspect of UC Riverside men’s basketball team this season has been its consistency. The Highlanders have won some key games, but the team’s inability to finish has cost them in the second half.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside is currently 8-8, with a 1-1 Big West conference record. Home games have been an advantage for Riverside this season, as the Highlanders are 7-1 when playing on their home court, but have struggled while playing on the road, going 1-7.</p>\n<p>“I think if you look at college basketball all over the country, it’s difficult to go on the road and win,” Head Coach Dennis Cutts said. “Five of those eight games have been right down to a possession or two.”</p>\n<p>Despite the team’s performance on the road this season, junior forward Taylor Johns and junior guard Jaylen Bland have emerged as UCR’s primary role players. Nearly averaging a double-double, Johns serves as the team’s focal point of its offensive game plan. He ranks fifth in scoring in the Big West, averaging 17.1 points per game and ranks second in both rebounding and blocks in the league with 8.7 rebounds per game and 1.9 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>As UC Riverside’s big man in the paint, Johns earned his first career Big West Men’s Basketball Athlete of the Week award in the week of Dec. 1-7, 2014. During that week of games, he averaged 20.5 points per game, 6.0 rebounds per game, and 2.0 blocks per game while shooting 73.9 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Jaylen Bland is a transfer guard from College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, California where he was selected to first team all-league and first team all-state. Bland has been a nice addition to the UC Riverside roster. Averaging 14.3 points per game, shooting 39.2 percent from the field and 39.8 percent from behind the three-point line, while leading the Highlanders in total steals with 17 this season.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside averages 68.3 points per game, shoots 43.2 percent from the field, and 36.1 percent from behind the perimeter. Defensively, the Highlanders allow 66.2 points per game, but play great on-ball defense ranking second in steals in the Big West averaging 6.8 steals per game.</p>\n<p>“We have got a team that will play through every possession, play you for 40 minutes and never feel like we’re really out of a game,” Cutts said. “I think at times when we have both ends of the floor together we can be a very good basketball team.”</p>\n<p>Last season the Highlanders ended with a 10-21 overall record and were 5-11 in conference games. They earned the No. 8 seed in the Big West Tournament but were knocked out of contention by the No. 1 seeded Anteaters in the quarterfinals.</p>\n<p>“This team is built a little differently than last year,” Cutts said. “We have the ability to shoot it better off multiple spots, more versatility defensively, can switch and do things more at the other end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>In just his second year as head coach, Dennis Cutts is confident and hopeful that his team will continue to progress throughout the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a ways to go,” Cutts said. “This program is chipping away and trying to find a way to get better players and add more players to the program. I think it’s just a process.”</p>\n<p>UC Riverside will host UC Davis tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Cal State Fullerton </strong><strong>Titans </strong>by Jack Mathews</p>\n<p>In an up-and-down preseason characterized by multiple winning streaks and losing streaks, the Cal State Fullerton men’s basketball team finds itself in eighth place in the conference and winners of five of its last six games.</p>\n<p>Fullerton was projected to finish eighth in the Big West Preseason Media Poll; however, they look to be a dark horse headed into conference as they are playing like anything but underdogs.</p>\n<p>After a subpar 2013-14 campaign in which the Titans finished 11-20 and lost in the first round of the Big West tournament, Fullerton is on the upswing with a record of 8-8 under second-year Head Coach Dedrique Taylor.</p>\n<p>The Titans are led by the electrifying play of senior guard Alex Harris who was honored as a Big West Honorable Mention player last season. Harris currently leads the Titans with 16.1 points, 3.4 assists and 1.3 steals per game.</p>\n<p>“Alex is everything,” Taylor said. “His energy, effort and basketball IQ offensively and defensively dictate how we play and he is rubbing off on other players and giving them purpose.”</p>\n<p>Harris is complemented by two of the Titans’ key transfers in junior guard Lanerryl Johnson and senior forward Moses Morgan. Morgan transferred from DePaul after the 2013-14 season and Johnson transferred from Central Arizona Junior College where he averaged 18.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Putting Alex at point guard has changed how our entire team has been playing as a whole,” Taylor said. “Role players like Laneryl and Moses are beginning to develop and understand their roles to help us win games.”</p>\n<p>Experience is certainly not a weakness of this team as seven of the 11 Titans to play this year are upperclassmen, although sophomore forward Joe Boyd has been a key player as well for Fullerton, as he has started all but one game this year.</p>\n<p>With six different players listed at 6’7” or taller, the Titans have been able to rely heavily on stingy defense and rebounding to propel them to success.</p>\n<p>The Titans averaged 72.6 points during a five-game winning streak heading into conference play, while only allowing opponents to score 56.4 points over that same span. The cohesion of CSFU on both sides of the ball has been key as it looks to lock down very tough Big West opponents throughout conference play.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton opened Big West play against UC Riverside in an 84-78 overtime loss. The Titans play UC Irvine tonight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Versions of these articles appeared on pages 1, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of January 15, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

Vincent’s scoring coupled with the energetic play of sophomore guard Hunter Ford helped Santa Barbara get back in the game.</p>\n<p>Ford, a walk-on who played a total of 16 minutes for the entire season prior to the game, was a much needed spark plug off the bench. Ford played 12 minutes and provided solid defense and rebounding, helping cut the lead to three after knocking down a three-pointer.</p>\n<p>“I think it was huge for him to come in and step in the way he did, and really spark us off the bench,” Williams said. “He’s a great shooter and I think that showed last night that [Head Coach Bob Williams] was able to put him in there and trust him.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finally broke through with three straight three’s beginning with a Bryson shot that tied the game, followed by Vincent giving the Gauchos their first lead since the 14 minute mark of the first half. Bryson delivered the dagger with a minute left by draining an open three from the corner that put the Gauchos on top 46-42 and permanently gave the Gauchos the lead.</p>\n<p>“I think at that point we saw the momentum shifting and felt more in control, because at that point we had already gotten a couple stops defensively,” Bryson said. “You can tell [Cal Poly’s] demeanor was starting to fade. The momentum was starting to switch on our favor.”</p>\n<p>UCSB hung in after a slow start to begin the second half. An 8-0 run by Cal Poly in the first five minutes and a quick three fouls committed by Big Al increased the Mustangs’ lead and sent UCSB’s primary scorer to the bench. It was then that Santa Barbara opted for a rotation of shooters on the floor to knock down the three-point shots that helped it get back into the game.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs had the lead for a majority of the game by forcing the Gauchos to play out of sync. Cal Poly imposed its own style of play, controlling the tempo and turning the game into a slow-downed, physical affair.</p>\n<p>“Going into it we knew what kind of game it would be — a low scoring, grind-it out game,” Williams said. “I think we just really focused in and knew what we had to do in order to pull that game out.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly could have widened its 23-20 halftime lead, but the team shot only 25 percent in the first half to keep UCSB within striking distance, despite creating problems on defense.</p>\n<p>Vincent led all scorers with 15 points and junior forward Joel Awich led the Mustangs with 13. Bryson, who had a quiet first half, added eight points, all coming in the second half.</p>\n<p>“In the first half I was in some type of a rut, I owe a lot of that to the Cal Poly defense and them slowing us with that 1-3-1 [defense], which really threw me out of whack,” Bryson said. “My teammates stayed resilient and kept us in it, and put me in position in order to knock down big shots.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly defended Big Al well, limiting him to only six points on seven attempts in the first half. It was not until later that Williams found his rhythm, especially on the block where he finished with 15 rebounds to go along with nine points.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for its first home conference game this Thursday when it takes on Cal State Northridge, and then travels to Long Beach State Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59642\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59642\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-12/ucsb-wins-conference-opener-in-comeback-fashion-against-cal-poly/","id":450,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[449,448,447],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Battle-tested Gauchos Square Off Against Rival Cal Poly","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M-Basketball-Stephen-Manga_web-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M-Basketball-Stephen-Manga_web-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Men's basketball is ready to kick-off the Big West season against Cal Poly with hopes of avenging last year's loss in the conference tournament.

The best player in the conference had fouled out with seven minutes left in the Big West Tournament quarterfinal, with his team on the verge of having its season end at the hands of Blue-Green rival, Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>UCSB was run out of the building, losing 69-38. It was the team’s worst loss of last season, a season that had promise of ending in a conference title. Ten months later, the Gauchos have a chance of exorcising their demons when they open Big West play Saturday against Cal Poly on the road.</p>\n<p>“There’s no love between the coaches and players, it’s a real rivalry. We’re going to treat it like one, and really go out and be the aggressors,” junior guard John Green said. “Cal Poly is a real defensive, physical team. We want to come out being physical as well, and show them that we can grind it out and win the Gaucho way.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara enters the contest with a 7-7 record overall and winner of its last two games, with wins over Vermont and Florida Gulf Coast. In each of those games, the team showed focus and a commitment to defense, a good sign heading into conference play.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been ready. These past two wins at home have given us an energy boost heading into Cal Poly,” Green said. “It’s our first game in conference and we know what happened last year in the Big West Tournament. We’re really active and excited to play against this team in their house.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cal Poly stands at 8-5, coming out on top in six of its last eight games. The Mustangs began conference yesterday against Hawaii as the team won a tough game, 61-57.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to play sound basketball for it to capitalize on whatever errors the Mustangs commit. Cal Poly currently leads the nation in fewest turnovers per game and on eight occasions it has kept turnovers to nine or less.</p>\n<p>Besides taking advantage of turnovers, it will be critical for UCSB to control the glass considering four of the Mustangs’ five losses have come when they lost the rebound battle.</p>\n<p>“We got to keep them off the glass,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In wins they average eight more rebounds than their opponents, in losses they get outrebounded. That’s a key factor for them.”</p>\n<p>How effective the Gauchos can block out for Big Al might decide this game. Williams, this week’s conference Player of the Week, is averaging 18.6 points and 11.9 rebounds for the season. Coming off consecutive double-doubles, Big Al heads into the contest 30 rebounds away from 1,000 for his career, which would make him only the fifth player in conference history to reach that milestone.</p>\n<p>A major contributor this season has also been Green. Injuries to his foot and wrist limited him to only four games in three years, but now that he is healthy, Green has been a key player off the bench averaging 11.1 points per game and scoring in double-digits in 10 of the last 13 games.</p>\n<p>If the Gauchos do come out on top in this Blue-Green rivalry game, it would be only their second conference-opening win in the last seven years.</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday at the Mott Athletics Center is set for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of January 8, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59454\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/battle-tested-gauchos-square-off-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59454\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/battle-tested-gauchos-square-off-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/battle-tested-gauchos-square-off-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/battle-tested-gauchos-square-off-against-rival-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/battle-tested-gauchos-square-off-against-rival-cal-poly/","id":485,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[484,483,482],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Finish Non-Conference Schedule With Win Over FGCU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Men's basketball faced Florida Gulf Coast Monday night, attempting to avenge a loss from earlier in the season.

The narrative was very different in the rematch as UCSB led from start to finish.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There was no lapse in focus by the Gauchos in the second half after building a double-digit lead in the first. UCSB applied pressure on the Eagles by outscoring them 10-2 to start the second half, extending its lead to 40-21.</p>\n<p>UCSB never let go of its double-digit lead, but the Eagles were still clinging on passing the six-minute mark, going on a 9-2 run to cut the lead to 12. Despite staying in the game, the Gauchos did not allow FGCU’s main weapons from getting in a rhythm on offense.</p>\n<p>FGCU’s leading scorer coming in, senior guard Bernard Thompson, shot just 35 percent in the game and senior guard Brent Comer was limited to only four points after scoring 28 in the first match.</p>\n<p>“This time we slid our feet more and we knew [Comer] was primarily going to do a few things and we shot it down,” senior guard Zalmico Harmon said. “He’s a great point guard and we just feel we scouted him pretty well, and did a good job of staying in front of him.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the backbreaker came just two minutes later as junior guard John Green nailed a bucket to increase UCSB’s lead to 16 with four minutes left and seal the win.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most impressive performance of the game came from sophomore guard Eric Childress. Childress provided a spark off the bench, hustling on defense and driving to the paint for tough buckets, en route to a season-high six points.</p>\n<p>“I thought he was really good. I thought he played really hard, really physical, scrappy, kind of had a chip on his shoulder and that’s exactly what we need out of him,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He helps change the game and it allows me — when he plays that physical and that aggressive — to play [Harmon] with him.”</p>\n<p>Poor shooting from the Eagles coupled by an energetic start by UCSB helped the Gauchos get off to an 8-2 lead in the opening minutes. Despite FGCU shooting a dismal 29 percent from the field in the first half, Santa Barbara suffered its own shooting slump to go into the half with the score at 30-19.</p>\n<p>Big Al’s performance in the first half foreshadowed what was to come in the second as the big man ended the first period with 10 rebounds to go along with eight points.</p>\n<p>“Any time he comes to play, he brings a presence that we all feel obligated to match at a certain level,” Harmon said.</p>\n<p>With the non-conference schedule now out of the way, the Gauchos now prepare for the start of Big West play. First game is at Cal Poly on Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59418\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/gauchos-finish-non-conference-schedule-with-win-over-fgcu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59418\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/gauchos-finish-non-conference-schedule-with-win-over-fgcu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/gauchos-finish-non-conference-schedule-with-win-over-fgcu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/gauchos-finish-non-conference-schedule-with-win-over-fgcu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-05/gauchos-finish-non-conference-schedule-with-win-over-fgcu/","id":479,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[478,477,476],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Basketball Set for Rematch Against FGCU","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.22.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.v.CSU_.Fullerton-18.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.22.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.v.CSU_.Fullerton-18.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB men's basketball prepares for Florida Gulf Coast in the run-up to the start of conference play.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_54388\" style=\"width: 621px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.22.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.v.CSU_.Fullerton-18.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"65114664\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"59392\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54388\" data-attachment-id=\"54388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/2-22-2014-ucsb-mens-basketball-v-csu-fullertonpeter-vandenbelt-2014-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.22.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.v.CSU_.Fullerton-18.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Peter Vandenbelt VBDphotos.com\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"2.22.2014 UCSB Mens Basketball v CSU Fullerton\\r\\r\\rPeter Vandenbelt 2014 \\u00a9\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1393092713\",\"copyright\":\"Peter R.

The Gauchos narrowly lost to the Eagles, an 81-75 defeat in overtime with senior center Alan Williams delivering his first monster game of the season. Big Al scored a game-high 29 points and 16 rebounds, including a pair of free throws under pressure to send the game into overtime.</p>\n<p>Florida Gulf Coast will need to contain Williams for it to stay in contention on the road. For UCSB, just as important as getting Big Al the ball will be defending senior guard Brett Comer. Comer torched the Gauchos for 28 points and ran the offense efficiently, posting 11 assists.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Aside from going inside to Williams for offense, the Gauchos must get scoring from their perimeter players as well to take advantage of the defenders Big Al draws. Santa Barbara shot a lowly 5-23 from three-point range in the first meeting between the teams. Poor shooting from three compounded by foul trouble limited the Gauchos’ offense that day.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenge the Eagles provide, UCSB comes in with some momentum after defeating Vermont in its previous game last Friday.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos enter the contest with a record of 6-7 after their 64-57 win over the Catamounts. A huge defensive effort from the Gauchos in the final minutes of the game made it possible for Santa Barbara to overcome a second-half deficit and bypass a good Vermont team. Previously, UCSB suffered two defeats from Pac-12 teams Oregon and Oregon State on the road.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara forced overtime against the Ducks in its Dec. 22 contest. However, the team failed to take advantage of key opportunities, losing 82-78. Against Oregon State a week later, UCSB started the game on fire, making 10 of 14 shots to jump out to a 26-10 lead in the first half.

(<em>Daily Nexus File photo</em>)</p></div>\n<p>A lackluster first half performance was too much to overcome for the UCSB men’s basketball team last night at the Thunderdome. The Gauchos were unable to take command of their troubles on offense and contain San Diego’s hot shooting display, losing to the Toreros 79-65.</p>\n<p>“[San Diego was] just hitting everything. They were playing well, they were executing,” freshman guard Gabe Vincent said. “It seemed on offense we couldn’t get it going at times. They took full control of this game. We didn’t come out ready to play, our minds weren’t in it.”</p>\n<p>With its first home loss of the season, UCSB drops to 4-5 while San Diego improves to 5-5. USD entered as the most challenging opponent the Gauchos have faced at home so far, and took advantage of Santa Barbara’s sluggish start to the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>San Diego shot 71 percent from three-point range — making 10 on 14 attempts — and 46 percent overall for the game, compared to the Gauchos’ 40 percent shooting from the field. Most of the Torero’s damage on the perimeter came courtesy of their starting backcourt in seniors Johnny Dee and Chris Anderson.</p>\n<p>Both players were points of emphasis on defense coming into the game, however, the Gauchos failed to neutralize both, with each shooting 3-4 from beyond the arc. Dee finished as the leading scorer of the game with 22 points and added six rebounds; Anderson totaled 17 points, second most on the team.</p>\n<p>“[Dee] had big shots and Chris Anderson got it going as well coming off ball screens,” junior guard John Green said. “We just weren’t ready to play at those times and moments when they came up big for their teams.”</p>\n<p>An uncharacteristic first half from senior center Alan Williams also contributed to the Gauchos’ lack of scoring. Big Al looked flustered in the half, scoring only five points and turning the ball over on four occasions.</p>\n<p>UCSB trailed 41-26 out of the break, but responded primarily with Big Al and junior guard Michael Bryson. Bryson ended the first half with no points but poured in 13 in the second.</p>\n<p>Williams’ bounced back, falling just short of a double-double with 18 points and eight rebounds.</p>\n<p>“You saw a different guy in the second half. That was a different mindset in the second half,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He got deeper post, he went up straight…He had an effort in the second half that is really indicative of who he is as a player.”</p>\n<p>A key turning point came early in the half when Vincent, one of the team’s best scorers, picked up his fourth foul two minutes in, sending him to the bench. Vincent did not return until the 10 minute mark with the Gauchos trailing 53-44, ultimately fouling out later on.</p>\n<p>UCSB trailed 57-50 with less than seven minutes to play, but like how most of the game went, as the Gauchos crept closer, the Toreros kept knocking down shots to further the distance, ultimately putting Santa Barbara away.</p>\n<p>“This was a disappointing performance on our part, very disappointing,” coach Williams said. “…We better use it as learning experience.

Seattle’s record drops to 3-4 with the loss.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara came out on fire to start the game, taking a 22-8 lead halfway through the first half. Freshman guard Gabe Vincent provided a spark off the bench in his first appearance back from injury, shooting 3-5 from long distance and dishing out three assists. His 11 points in the half lead all scorers going into the break.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to get to 100 percent so I could come back and play hard,” Vincent said. “My coaching staff has faith in me and so do the players.”</p>\n<p>Much of the Redhawks’ offensive struggles were a result of the defense played by the point guard duo of senior Zalmico Harmon and sophomore Eric Childress, both of whom contained Seattle’s main weapon in senior guard Isiah Umipig. Umipig, who came into the game as Seattle’s leading scorer, was limited to only four shot attempts and eight points in the half and was a non-factor in the second.</p>\n<p>“I think our point guards did a phenomenal job guarding Umipig and making sure he never really got going,” junior guard Michael Bryson said. “That’s the biggest thing with him — once he gets going it’s really hard to stop him, so we never really let him get going.”</p>\n<p>Umipig was not helped by his teammates either as only three other Redhawks scored before halftime, and the team as a whole shot only 32 percent from the field for the game, compared to 59 percent by the Gauchos. Senior guard Jarell Flora, the Redhawks’ second leading scorer, was also contained on the night to finish with only six points on a dismal 3-13 shooting.</p>\n<p>UCSB did not take its foot off the gas coming out of halftime, applying pressure to Seattle and continuing to extend its lead; the Gauchos led 60-30 with 12 minutes left in the half, putting the game away for good.</p>\n<p>With junior forward Mitch Brewe out due to a concussion suffered in the previous game, junior guard John Green replaced him in the starting lineup. Green contined to show flashes of what he is capable of when healthy as he totaled 11 points on an efficient 5-8 shooting.</p>\n<p>UCSB will take the weekend off until Monday when it goes on the road once again to Texas to face Southern Methodist University.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color:

and athletes entered the record books, 2014 will be remembered for what transpired off the field.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 2, the Seattle Seahawks claimed their first Super Bowl title by completely dominating Peyton Manning and the Broncos. 112.2 million viewers watched the game, the most watched program in U.S. history.</p>\n<p>The NFL was on top of the entertainment world and NFL commissioner Roger

Goodell could have taken matters into his own hands and penalized Rice from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Instead, he opted suspending the Baltimore Raven for only two games, and not until video of Rice knocking out his fiancée was released for public viewing — creating a media firestorm and causing the league to lose sponsors — did Goodell take serious action.</p>\n<p>Then, a serious of other domestic violence cases surrounding more NFL players came to light and the league found itself in a public image crisis.</p>\n<p>Rice’s situation was only the tip of the iceberg. Early into the season, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was indicted for reckless or negligent injury to a child, that child being his four-year-old son. The child suffered from cuts, lacerations and bruises. He told authorities, “There are a lot of belts in Daddy’s closet.”</p>\n<p>What should have been a year in which we saw if the Seahawks could repeat and watched J.J. Watt dominate opposing teams, has been overcast by player conduct off the field.</p>\n<p>But the NFL wasn’t the only league this year to shy away from scandal. In April, recorded audio of Clippers owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks was released, causing outcry from fans, players and other people within the league.</p>\n<p>Unlike Goodell, new NBA commissioner Adam Silver realized the gravity of Sterling’s remarks and took the appropriate action against him, banning the owner from the league for life.</p>\n<p>That’s what separates the two commissioners. One is concerned solely with profits, while the other is aware of his league’s place in society and is taking a stance for what is right.</p>\n<p>Despite controversy off the field, there were truly inspirational moments that reinforced why we love sports so much. Take for instance Mo’ne Davis, a Little League pitcher from Philadelphia who became the first girl to throw a shutout in the Little League World Series. Her New Year’s resolution: keep on throwing like a girl.</p>\n<p>Or how about Derek Jeter’s final farewell at Yankee Stadium. The 20-year veteran ended his legendary career with a game-winning hit in the bottom of the ninth inning. At that moment, one play captured the essence of a brilliant career.</p>\n<p>In Division III women’s college basketball, freshman Lauren Hill was diagnosed with brain cancer after committing to play for Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>With only a few months left to play, the NCAA decided to reschedule MSJ’s home opener so Hill could play. She had four points and said during the game, “Let’s not call this my last game. This is my first collegiate game.”</p>\n<p>So sports fans, although this might not have been the best year, keep in mind that for every league embarrassment there are a thousand more stories like Lauren Hill’s, and that’s what keeps us coming back.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of December 4, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

Against Mercer, Williams had a 20/20 game, putting up 22 points and a career-high 20 rebounds.</p>\n<p>He became just the 10th player in program history to record 1,400 points and could potentially become the all-time rebound leader for UCSB in this game, needing just seven more to top the list.<br>\nJunior guard John Green will start in place of junior forward Mitch Brewe, who suffered a concussion the previous game.</p>\n<p>“We will be playing a little bit smaller and it will be a chance for us to play two bigs together,” Williams said. “Play John a little bit more at the four and also maybe a chance for [sophomore forward Alex Hart] to get some minutes at the four.”</p>\n<p>Freshman guard Gabe Vincent will also see playing time for the first time since the second game of the season; he comes back from an infected blister on his foot.</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Seattle is set for 7:30 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of December 4, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59002\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/gauchos-return-home-look-to-bounce-back-against-seattle/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59002\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/gauchos-return-home-look-to-bounce-back-against-seattle/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/gauchos-return-home-look-to-bounce-back-against-seattle/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/gauchos-return-home-look-to-bounce-back-against-seattle/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-04/gauchos-return-home-look-to-bounce-back-against-seattle/","id":474,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[473,472,471],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":11,"route":"/authors/65"}},"__N_SSG":true}
