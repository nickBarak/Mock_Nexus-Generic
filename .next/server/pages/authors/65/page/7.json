This tainted image of Rodriguez has come full circle and to many fans he is now the biggest liar in the history of the game.<br>\nBaseball is making a statement with this suspension and if it hasn’t completely removed itself from the steroid era, it has so with this decision. Twelve other players were suspended along with Rodriguez but none come close to what Rodriguez got. In fact, the player who was suspended the most games other than Rodriguez, Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, was suspended for only 65 games.<br>\nSo why was Rodriguez suspended for this length? Because not only is he guilty of more wrongdoing than any other player suspended, but what got him in even more hot water was his attempt to obstruct the investigation process such as trying to tamper with evidence. That’s what earned him a stiffer sentence than the rest and he must now deal with the consequences.<br>\nHowever, in typical A-Rod fashion, he choose to avert the situation. When asked point blank in a news conference if he used performance-enhancing drugs, he declined to answer the question, saying he would answer at another time. This stance, more than anything else declares his guilt.<br>\nWhat he attempted to do was make himself look like the victim in the situation, saying that the past seven months for him have been a “nightmare” and that he is “fighting for his life.”<br>\nThe public has grown tired of his denials and cat-and-mouse games. Rodriguez even accused MLB and the Yankees of trying to keep him from playing, a claim the Yankees have flat-out denied. The player who once was suppose to be the greatest player ever to play and become baseball’s “clean” home run king, may now never play again if the suspension holds.<br>\nIf the ruling is upheld, he will be 39 years old and going on 40 when his suspension ends and he has already suffered from more than one hip and knee surgery, not to mention that his offensive production has dipped in recent years. That scenario seems very likely to end his career, if not at least mark the beginning of the end for him.<br>\nRodriguez might be motivated to come back for the remaining money the Yankees will owe him. In 2007, he signed the richest contract in MLB history when he agreed to a 10-year, 275 million dollar deal. A-Rod can lose anywhere from 30.6 to 32.7 million dollars if suspended, yet he will still be owed about 100 million dollars and have four and a half years[[wouldn’t it be 2 years if he’s suspended until 2015?]] left on his deal when his punishment ends.<br>\nStill, Rodriguez is appealing the ruling and is allowed to play while waiting for a decision, which will not come until November or December at the earliest. The player’s union has already expressed that they will defend Rodriguez and has accused commissioner Bud Selig as “not acting [appropriately]”.  So, even when MLB tries to push him out, they still can’t push him out completely.<br>\nWith the door closed on the steroid issue, for now at least, fans can now appreciate the rest of the season. Division races are tight heading into the final month and a half of the season and players like Miguel Cabrera of the Tigers and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers are having stellar seasons.<br>\nThere’s nothing positive about these suspensions but they go a long way in helping clean up the game. Fans must accept it for what it is and move on while Rodriguez accepts his place on the pantheon of cheaters alongside Barry Bonds, Lance Armstrong and Marion Jones.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Wikipedia.org.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51816\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/a-rods-suspension-changes-the-way-mlb-looks-at-cheaters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51816\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/a-rods-suspension-changes-the-way-mlb-looks-at-cheaters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/a-rods-suspension-changes-the-way-mlb-looks-at-cheaters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/a-rods-suspension-changes-the-way-mlb-looks-at-cheaters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-27/a-rods-suspension-changes-the-way-mlb-looks-at-cheaters/","id":3220,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3219,3218,3217],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Brings in Three Recruits For Next Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_000.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_000.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"With a majority of players returning from last year’s squad, the UCSB men’s volleyball team will have only three recruits coming in for next season.

At 6’5’’, Kasseff does maintain the capabilities to start for the Gauchos but will not be a replacement for Davis; instead UCSB will rely on the veterans to fill the void.</p>\n<p>“The other guys are all going to be all a little stronger, a little more experienced, a little better and that’s the way that you can kind of replace one guy,” McLaughlin said. “[Kasseff] isn’t necessarily going to be Dylan Davis; he doesn’t have to be, but as long as the other guys around him take another step forward, we can overcome that.”</p>\n<p>In his senior season playing for the Nevada Union, Curtis led the team to a 20-6 overall record and a regular season division title.

Morgan specifically has one of these knacks; when she shoots, it’s going on frame hard,” Stumpf said. “Makenna is going to be a more wide-striker type that’s going to deliver the balls.”</p>\n<p>Along with Idso and Kummer, forward/midfield Ashley Dean from Yucaipa High School and center midfielder McKinsey Martinez from Rancho Cucamonga High School have the potential to start right away as strikers for the Gauchos in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>Dean gives UCSB a left-footed threat capable of scoring and is able to play multiple positions, most notably as an outside back that gets forward. Martinez, although undersized, provides another aerial threat for the Gauchos. Besides the ability to shoot, her playmaking abilities in the midfield makes another versatile player on the field, as she finished her senior season with six assists.</p>\n<p>“We had trouble scoring goals and these are all forwards we really feel they’re going to come in and challenge for starting spots right away,” Stumpf said. “If not that, they’re going to be the first ones coming off the bench.”</p>\n<p>Although three starters from the backline will be returning this season, the Gauchos will benefit from the arrival of Coto de Caza native Kailey Hackett from Santa Margarita Catholic High School. The central defender/sweeper also has the chance for competing for a starting position right away because of her defensive prowess on the pitch. As a senior she won a pair of titles and was selected as First Team All-CIF.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Gauchos only managed to score more than one goal twice in nine conference games. However, with the added size and talent coming from the recruiting class, UCSB will be more potent offensively in the upcoming season.</p>\n<p>“I think the size and I think the quality is two things that make this group standout,” Stumpf said. “We’re going to be a very different team next year.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"396943007\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51410\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51411\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/soccer-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer.jpg?fit=550%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"550,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Soccer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer.jpg?fit=250%2C182&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer.jpg?fit=550%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51411\" alt=\"Soccer\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Soccer-250x181.jpg?resize=250%2C181\" width=\"250\" height=\"181\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 16, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy of UCSB Athletics.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51410\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51410\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-16/ucsb-brings-in-14-for-2013-recruiting-class/","id":1621,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1620,1619,1618],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Rose Smart For Sitting Amid Playoffs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Having LeBron James on your team doesn’t guarantee you an automatic victory, as evidenced by the Chicago Bulls stealing game one of the Eastern Conference semifinals from the Miami Heat.

Similarly, having Derrick Rose on your team won’t guarantee you a win either.</p>\n<p>It’s been over a year since Rose tore up his knee in last year’s postseason. Yet, the Bulls have managed the entire season without him and are in just as good of a position right now compared to if he were in the lineup. Cleared by doctors to play two months ago, the lingering question remains: Why hasn’t he stepped on the court yet?</p>\n<p>In sports, we’re constantly reminded of the heroism that comes with playing injured. Images of a hobbling Willis Reed walking onto the court with a torn thigh muscle in game seven or Michael Jordan scoring 38 points while playing with a 103 degree fever in the NBA Finals will forever remain etched in basketball lore. However, Rose and the Bulls have taken a completely different approach to handling their situation, and that is to sit and wait until Rose is completely ready.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Skeptics argue that Rose is being selfish and putting himself before the team. With teammates like Joakim Noah battling with plantar fasciitis and still willing the Bulls to the semis, Rose’s toughness and dedication has been questioned.</p>\n<p>But what Rose is doing is the right choice not just for himself but also for the Bulls organization. For a player that is only 24 years old, there is no need for him to risk coming back from a career threatening-injury for a slim chance of defeating the Heat in a seven-game series. Let’s face it, the Bulls caught Miami by surprise in game one, but don’t count on that happening again.</p>\n<p>With the year Adrian Peterson had still fresh in our minds, it’s difficult to remember the numerous instances where other athletes never recovered from this injury, such as Olympian Michael Redd, who had his career cut short because of the ACL tear he suffered.</p>\n<p>The underlying issue here is not whether Rose is physically ready to play but whether he is mentally prepared to take the court. A player cannot be effective if he doesn’t trust his own knee to make sharp cuts and is repeatedly fearful of re-injury. The real topic of concern here with Rose is when he will finally be ready to get past that final mental hurdle; obviously, he still isn’t there yet.</p>\n<p>Let’s not forget what the other Bulls players have done in the playoffs either. While the basketball world was shocked that the Bulls went into Miami with one day of rest after defeating the Nets in seven games, the Bulls, on the other hand, were not surprised at all. They expected to win.</p>\n<p>Noah and Jimmy Butler combined for 34 points with 25 rebounds in game one, and Nate Robinson filled the role of the go-to guy for Chicago, scoring 27 points on 50 percent shooting. Chicago stuck to its game plan, and that is to play physically against an undersized Heat front court. They finished with a 46-32 advantage on the boards and outscored Miami 40-32 in the paint. If the Bulls continue to do this throughout the series, James and company will have to wait for ring number two until next year.</p>\n<p>Miami has much more to worry about than wondering if Rose will come back and play in the series because in all likelihood, Rose probably will not see any action in this round of the playoffs or for the rest of the postseason. However, when he does come back, all eyes will be on him and his knee.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51262\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51262\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-10/rose-smart-for-sitting-amid-playoffs/","id":3207,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3206,3205,3204],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Jason Collins Breaks Another Barrier","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Jason-Collins-sports.inquirer.net_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Jason-Collins-sports.inquirer.net_.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Monday was the historic day we have all been waiting for.

Although both players announced the same thing, this case is different and carries more significance because Collins is a man.</p>\n<p>Superstars from Kobe Bryant to Kevin Durant, as well as current and former teammates of Collins, have expressed their support for him. Because of the politically correct environment we live in and fear of getting labeled as homophobic by the media, it is unlikely we will hear other athletes, except Mike Wallace of the NFL, speak out against Collins’ sexual preference. Still, he in all likelihood will suffer from intolerant verbal abuse from players and fans if he does play in the NBA again.</p>\n<p>The announcement marks the first step for Collins. However, the next phase is to actually step onto the court and play. Collins is already at the declining stage of his career and is nothing more than a solid role player off the bench at best. He’s coming off a year where he played a total of 38 games and scored 41 total points, averaging eight minutes per game.</p>\n<p>The next NBA team to sign Collins will likely sign him because of his leadership abilities on and off the court. Yet, if no team ends up signing him, it will diminish the importance of him coming out, as there still would not be an openly gay player to play professionally. The magnitude of Collins coming out hinders on if he actually ends up on the roster of an NBA team by next season.</p>\n<p>Only then will we be able to see the progress American sports has made in regards to accepting gay athletes into their profession; otherwise, Collins will be just another athlete who came out after his playing days were over. A Stanford graduate and well-spoken individual, Collins serves as the perfect ambassador for gay male athletes in a culture that has repeatedly rejected antimasculine behavior.</p>\n<p>There has been a lot of speculation of players in the NFL coming out and it will be interesting to see how football players and the league reacts when this happens, especially since the NFL has had trouble dealing with the sensitivity of the issue. Nonetheless, the NBA has handled this case perfectly with Commissioner David Stern issuing his support.</p>\n<p>Collins no doubt made this decision for his own well-being, as he admitted he didn’t intend to be the first male athlete to come out, but his choice to come out marks an important milestone for sports in the country. More importantly, his announcement serves as an inspiration for active and future gay athletes to play their careers being who they are.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy of sports.inquirer.net</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51141\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51141\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-03/jason-collins-breaks-another-barrier/","id":3192,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3191,3190,3189],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Take  Fourth at Conference Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Golf","publish_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golf2_CourtesyOfTonyMastres.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golf2_CourtesyOfTonyMastres.jpg?resize=500%2C377&ssl=1","description":"Led by sophomore Brett Silvernail’s first-place score, the UCSB golf team closed out the Big West Conference Championship yesterday with a fourth-place finish.

Epstein and Colby ended the tournament in 17th and 41st place, respectively.</p>\n<p>Another notable performance by the Gauchos was delivered by sophomore Amol Mahal who placed 36th overall by shooting 17-over par 233.</p>\n<p>The tournament marks the final competition for the Gauchos this season as they look to build on what they accomplished this year going forward. With only two seniors on the current roster, the team will rely on its core group of returning players for next season.</p>\n<p>“Building on what we did in those last two rounds I think is really going to be one of our goals going into next year,” Ley said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo Courtesy of Tony Mastres</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51147\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51147\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-02/gauchos-take-fourth-at-conference-championship/","id":1807,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1806,1805,1804],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Davis Named National Blocker of the Year","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-111.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-111.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"After four years serving the UCSB men’s volleyball team, senior middle blocker Dylan Davis was honored this past week with the Off The Block/Springbak, Inc.

Despite the individual achievements, Davis still acknowledges the important role his teammates and coaching staff played this season.</p>\n<p>“They were absolutely everything; without them there’s no way I would’ve even come close to getting the numbers I did this year,” Davis said. “The coaching staff and the team — they’ve all been pushing me to be the best player I can be. I think I did that my senior year.”</p>\n<p>This is the second major honor bestowed on Davis this season. Earlier he was selected as an All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation first team selection, being one of only two middle blockers to be selected for the first team.</p>\n<p>“I was just trying to be the best I could be and whatever came out of that I gladly accept,” Davis said. “These rewards mean a lot to me and I’m really glad I got them, but these weren’t something I was planning on from the get go.”</p>\n<p>This season alone Davis recorded double-digit kills on six occasions, including a season-high 14 kills against UC San Diego on Feb. 1. Davis had his most complete game of the season while on the road versus USC, where he put up a double-double with 11 kills, 14 blocks and a .500 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>“Our win against USC — that was one of the games where we turned it around and got our win streak going,” Davis said. “That was one of the bigger games this year.”</p>\n<p>Although his collegiate career might have ended last week after the Gauchos lost to UC Irvine in the first round of the MPSF playoffs, his professional career is just beginning as he aspires to play professionally and for the national team in the Olympics. If he gets there, Davis will be the first one to thank the UCSB volleyball program for helping him get there.</p>\n<p>“Without these guys I don’t think I would’ve become the kind of person I am today, I really have to thank them for getting me out of my shell that I had when I came out of high school,” Davis said. “They all pushed me to be a better person. It’s a great program with a great group of guys.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Daniel Wade of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51041\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51041\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/davis-named-national-blocker-of-the-year/","id":5301,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5300,5299,5298],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season With Loss to UCI","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_006.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_006.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It seemed like 2011 was about to repeat itself.

Santa Barbara could not shake off its trouble on the road, finishing the season 4-10 away from the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>After starting the season 3-9 in conference, the Gauchos posted a near-perfect record in March, including a seven-game winning streak to propel them into the seventh seed of the playoffs. However, Santa Barbara had a disappointing conclusion to its season and ended up losing four of its last five games.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, UC Irvine continues its run as the hottest team in the nation, extending its winning streak to six games. At 23-6 overall and 19-6 MPSF, the Anteaters seemed poised to reclaim the national title as they advance to the league semifinals against the third-seed Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p>UCSB still has an outside chance of reaching the Final Four by earning the only at-large bid available, but their first round exit and overall record makes that possibility highly unlikely.</p>\n<p>A back-and-forth first set ended up going to UC Irvine who had to fend off a resilient Gaucho attack to win the frame 26-24. UCSB responded as best they have the entire season, winning the second (25-22) and third set (25-20) to take a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Despite the lead, Irvine won the fourth set decisively 25-19 and built a five-point lead in fifth set, ultimately winning the final frame 15-10 and eliminating UCSB from the postseason.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht once again led the Gauchos in kills with 19, but Irvine was able to contain his offensive efficiency and limited Licht to a .205 hitting percentage. Licht added 10 digs and four blocks on defense.</p>\n<p>In his final game wearing the UCSB uniform, senior middle blocker Dylan Davis finished off his impressive career by recording six kills and four blocks. His 441 total blocks ranks third overall in program history.</p>\n<p>Irvine advances to the next round primarily on the play of junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. Tillie delivered on both ends of the court, finishing with 15 kills and seven digs. His three kills in the final set proved to be the difference as he delivered the final point of the match to send the Gauchos back home.</p>\n<p>The middle blocker tandem of juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring was effective in containing the Gaucho offense and held UCSB to a .213 hitting percentage for the game, compared to a .285 clip for the Anteaters. Kevorken and Mehring combined for 12 kills and 11 total blocks in the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will have to fill the huge void left by Davis and its three other seniors, including outside hitter Miles Evans, but the remaining players can rely on the experience and chemistry established this year going forward.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50974\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50974\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-22/ucsb-ends-season-with-loss-to-uci/","id":5307,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5306,5305,5304],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Head to Irvine to Begin Postseason Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_001.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_001.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It’s one and done from here on out.

However, UCSB has evolved into a completely different team in the two month span since the last time these teams played.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht has turned into the go-to player for the Gauchos, recording double-digit kills in his final seven games of the season and leading the team in kills for much of that span. Having only made one total appearance as a substitute in both games against the Anteaters, Licht will add an extra dimension for UCSB’s offense.</p>\n<p>The game has added meaning for senior middle blocker Dylan Davis. In what quite possibly may be his final game of his collegiate career, Davis, the lone remaining starter from the team that reached the title game two years ago, has guided the team for much of the season and brings proven postseason experience to a relatively young squad.</p>\n<p>The team captain has delivered for the Gauchos throughout the season, posting 1.37 blocks per game and averaging a .438 hitting percentage, ranking third and sixth in the conference, respectively. In the first match against Irvine, Davis was forced to exit from the game early due to injury and could not play in the final crucial moments of the match.</p>\n<p>Sweeping five of its last seven opponents, UC Irvine enters the playoffs as the hottest team in the country and ready to repeat as champions. With the best middle blocker tandem in the league, juniors Scott Kevorken and Collin Mehring, Irvine is second in the MPSF in opponent hitting percentage (.238). Kevorken and Mehring come in with a .506 and .484 hitting percentage, respectively.</p>\n<p>If that was not enough to contain for the Gauchos, they will also have to account for AVCA National Player of the Year, junior outside hitter Kevin Tillie. This year, the Frenchman has averaged 3.83 kills per set and had a total of 32 kills in seven total sets against the Gauchos this season.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s game is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50928\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50928\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/gauchos-head-to-irvine-to-begin-postseason-play/","id":5300,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5299,5298,5297],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Stepping Up When it Matters Most","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DWade-MensVballVUCI-3-7-11.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"If you thought the only underdogs winning in college were in basketball, think again.

His 437 total blocks throughout his career ranks third all-time in program history. However, what you don’t see is Davis’ significance to the young team inside the locker room.</p>\n<p>“He’s been a great leader; he’s our captain and he’s gotten these guys to push every day in practice and really set their goals, and really work towards them,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “That wasn’t an easy thing to do when we were 3-9 in league and he kept going and kept to the task, and now we’re [11-13] in league and we’re in the playoffs.”</p>\n<p>As a sophomore, Davis was thrust onto volleyball’s biggest stage with six seniors starting alongside him and despite losing in the title game against Ohio State, that experience has been invaluable in shaping Davis’ role as team captain this year.</p>\n<p>“Being one of the only guys left on the team that was able to experience [the NCAA Final Four], I realize that I have to bring a kind of leadership to this team and just be the most complete player I possibly can,” Davis said. “And just allow the other players to build off of it [and] gain their own confidence … That’s pretty much been my own goal.”</p>\n<p>Sneaking into the MPSF playoffs as a No. 7 seed in 2011, the Gauchos went on an improbable run, defeating the No. 2, No. 6 and top overall seed USC en route to capturing the conference title and ultimately losing the national title game in five sets. Yet, perhaps no game in that incredible run was more significant to Davis than the national semifinal rematch versus USC.</p>\n<p>On the game’s biggest stage, Davis picked the right occasion for his coming-out party. In the match, Davis recorded 15 kills and a NCAA tournament record .882 hitting percentage, leading his team to the championship game and marking the beginning of Davis’ transition to being the leader he is now for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“It gave me confidence in that I could compete with anybody on the other side,” Davis said. “I knew that the way I played was going to be the way I dictated my season and that game — having one of the best games of my career, really taught me I can hang with whomever.”</p>\n<p>Despite losing back in 2011, Davis has used the loss to fuel him to get his current team to where he wants them to be as they prepare to make their first postseason appearance after missing out last year.</p>\n<p>“I think it gives him the desire to get back there and win it,” McLaughlin said. “We had a tough loss back there two years ago and I think that just makes Dylan even hungrier to get this team on the same page so we can get back there and win it.”</p>\n<p>Entering the season with a roster consisting of only three seniors, Davis had the responsibility of leading a very young team through the toughest conference in collegiate volleyball. Yet, the team has responded to Davis’ style of leadership and he has embraced his role of team captain and all the pressures that come along with it.</p>\n<p>“There are guys that look up to you. You have to always be ready to play. You can’t have an off day. You’re going to be the guy that everyone looks up to in the end,” Davis said. “It’s just one of those situations where you have to be confident and be sure of yourself that you’re going to handle that pressure of people expecting so much of you.”</p>\n<p>Now a senior and playing in his final opportunity to win a national championship, Davis understands the potential this team has developed over the course of the season and is confident his team can make a run like they did when he was just a sophomore.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is starting to click and it couldn’t have come at a better time right now,” Davis said. “I have high hopes for the end of the season and we just got to keep it going … I don’t want it to stop; I don’t want the end to come soon.”</p>\n<p>Although UCSB will have to play on the road in the first round of the playoffs against UC Irvine on Saturday, the Gauchos still have a little magic on their side in Davis, and we all know what happened last time he entered the playoffs as an underdog.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Daniel Wade of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50882\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50882\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-17/stepping-up-when-it-matters-most/","id":5299,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5298,5297,5296],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Season Finale to Pepperdine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_010.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_010.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"Senior night had no happy ending for the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team.

The two applied pressure on the Gaucho defense throughout the match.</p>\n<p>In his final regular season game at home, Davis led the way for the Gauchos with an impressive stat line of 10 kills, four digs and a .571 hitting percentage. Junior opposite Evan Licht continues his excellent play and had a career-high 23 kills for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Despite ending the season on a loss, the season is still not over for the Gauchos. Next for Santa Barbara will be a road playoff game in the quarterfinals against Irvine with the winner advancing to the next stage of the MPSF tournament. The game is scheduled for Saturday at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-15/ucsb-falls-in-season-finale-to-pepperdine/","id":5324,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5323,5322,5321],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Captures Crucial Victory Over USC","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/M-Volleyball_Mark-Brocher_for-04.12.2013.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/M-Volleyball_Mark-Brocher_for-04.12.2013.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"It wasn’t pretty, but it was a still a win for the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team.

Currently in the eighth slot in the conference, Santa Barbara continues its success at home and improves to an 11-5 record at the Thunderdome. More significantly, the win keeps UCSB’s hopes alive of getting a higher seed in the playoffs with just one game remaining in the regular season.</p>\n<p>UCSB came out aggressively in the first set and had a commanding lead, taking care of business despite USC making a late run in the game to make things interesting. Nevertheless, Santa Barbara won 25-23.</p>\n<p>With Southern Cal having only a .156 hitting percentage in the second frame, Santa Barbara exploited the Trojan defense and went various runs throughout the set. The Gauchos took a 2-0 advantage by beating USC 25-19.</p>\n<p>Despite losing the third set 25-21, the Gauchos regrouped and handed the Trojans a 25-17 defeat in the fourth set to win 3-1. UCSB was on point defensively in the fourth and held USC to a .000 hitting percentage.</p>\n<p>Junior middle blocker Evan Licht continues playing at a high caliber level and had seven assists and four blocks to go along with a team-high 19 kills. The 19 kills makes it the sixth straight game he has recorded double-digit kills and the eighth time out of the last 10 games he has led the team.</p>\n<p>“He brings a level headedness to the court that really helps everyone. We kind of feed off his calmness at times,” freshman setter Jonah Seif said. “He doesn’t get dazed when he starts making errors; he stays focused and it really helps the team.”</p>\n<p>With an impressive .800 hitting percentage, Staahl delivered a clutch performance for the Gauchos and provided defense down the middle of the court with eight total blocks.</p>\n<p>“Staahl jumps a lot higher than [USC’s] middles do, so I just really tried to put the ball as high as I could for him,” Seif said. “He just hit over them, he had a really good night.”</p>\n<p>With only one game left in the regular season against No. 6 Pepperdine, the game has high implications for the Gauchos as they are still in contention of improving their seeding by as many as two slots. Currently, UCSB is half a game behind Stanford for the sixth seed and one game behind Pepperdine for fifth.</p>\n<p>“If we can come out and beat Pepperdine Friday that’ll mean a lot to our team because Pepperdine is a great team,” Staahl said.</p>\n<p>In the previous meeting between the two teams, UCSB was in the midst of a three game losing streak and lost to the Waves in three sets. In that game, Santa Barbara was unable to stop the impressive offense Pepperdine displayed.</p>\n<p>The Waves controlled every facet of the game and hit for a .420 clip and outdug UCSB by a 22-14 margin.</p>\n<p>UCSB will honor its three seniors before its final home game of the regular season, including team captain Davis and Evans.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against Pepperdine is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 11th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50776\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50776\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-11/ucsb-captures-crucial-victory-over-usc/","id":5316,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5315,5314,5313],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Ready to Snap Two-Game Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_0072.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_0072.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With only two games left in the regular season, the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team plans to end the season strong and gain momentum for the playoffs when it plays USC tonight at the Thunderdome.

Although the team has lost consecutive games for the first time since February after Friday’s five-set loss to BYU, the Gauchos have still won seven of their last nine matches, including sweeping five of those opponents in three sets.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest thing is we’re not killing ourselves as much, we’re making teams play,” Licht said. “[Head Coach Rick McLaughlin] is giving us great scouting reports. When we get the ball we serve hard, we pass well, good things happened and it’s showed over the past few weeks.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, USC comes into the Thunderdome at 6-16 overall and in MPSF play, and are eliminated from postseason contention. In the last meeting between these two teams in Los Angeles, the Gauchos upset the Trojans 3-1, which marked the turning point in the season for the Gauchos as the team went on to win eight of the following nine games.</p>\n<p>“[USC is] going to be a lot better this time. They’re going to be hungry,” McLaughlin said. “Last time we were the ones who surprised them. They’re going to try to surprise us so we just got to be ready and play like the way we did [against BYU], and if we do that we’ll have a good chance.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore outside hitter Cristian Rivera will be the main threat likely to cause problems for Santa Barbara. In his last game against Cal State Northridge, Rivera had a team-high 18 kills and hit for an impressive .500 clip. This season, Rivera is third on the team with 147 kills so far.</p>\n<p>UCSB will still be without some of its key players tonight including senior outside hitter Miles Evans, whose presence was missed in Friday’s game versus BYU. Still, the Gauchos understand the importance of finishing the season strong as they prepare to play in the MPSF playoffs in two weeks.</p>\n<p>“We have to finish strong heading into the playoffs, we don’t want to go not playing our best,” McLaughlin said. “If we can play like we did [against BYU] I think we got a good shot at these next two opponents … That’s easier said than done.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s match is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Photo by Megali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50748\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50748\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-10/gauchos-ready-to-snap-two-game-skid/","id":5337,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5336,5335,5334],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to No. 1 BYU in Full Five Sets","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_009.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MagaliGauthier_MenVolleyball_040513_009.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"  In February, the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team lost against top-ranked BYU in Utah in five sets.

The defeat comes as UCSB’s first home loss since January and only its second loss in its past nine games. BYU extended its winning streak to 12 and improves to 20-3 overall and 19-2 in the MPSF.</p>\n<p>“Any time you can go toe-to-toe with the No. 1 team in the country, some good stuff’s happening on your side of the net,” Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. “It’s a tough loss, but they learned a lot and we look forward to playing these guys again.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took the first set 25-20 in large part to various runs it made throughout the frame. However, the Cougars responded in game two despite trailing by as many as five points in the set, mounting a comeback to win 25-20.</p>\n<p>Each team traded sets from there on, with the Gauchos winning the third set 25-18 and losing the fourth set 25-21.</p>\n<p>In the fifth set, UCSB found itself down 8-5 before switching sides of the court and going on a 7-2 run to take a 12-10 lead. Yet, BYU remained poised and won 15-13. It was UCSB’s fifth five-set loss of the season.</p>\n<p>“Typically fifth sets are a little more steady than that, but both teams gave up some runs,” McLaughlin said. “We got ourselves right back in it and we actually had the lead and probably the player of the year, [BYU outside hitter] Taylor Sander, made it when it counted. That guy came through. He was clutch; it all goes to him.”</p>\n<p>Freshman setter Jonah Seif was able to read the Cougar defense throughout the course of the match, setting up many opportunities for UCSB and recording 45 assists in the match. Santa Barbara was led by Licht, who had a career-high 21 kills to go along with four blocks and eight digs, making it the seventh time out of the past nine games he has led the Gauchos in kills.</p>\n<p>Although the Gauchos had 16 blocks and limited Brigham Young to just a .187 hitting percentage, Sander delivered a clutch performance and took over late in the game on his way to recording 18 kills and 11 digs. Freshman opposite Ben Patch was equally impressive with 19 kills.</p>\n<p>UCSB now gets ready to play against USC on Wednesday in its second-to-last game of the regular season at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of April 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Megali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50712\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50712\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-08/ucsb-falls-to-no-1-byu-in-full-five-sets/","id":5336,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5335,5334,5333],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Streak Ends at Seven","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MVBall-Mark-Brocher-DSC_5654.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MVBall-Mark-Brocher-DSC_5654.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"All good things must come to an end, and that was the case for the No. 7 UCSB men’s volleyball team last night against No. 6 Cal Baptist.

From there on, the Lancers dominated the frame, scoring eight of the final nine points to steal the set.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist picked up where it left off from the first set and had an early advantage in the second game.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Gauchos mounted a comeback of their own and tied the frame at 18, despite trailing throughout. Just as in the previous set, Cal Baptist outlasted UCSB for a 26-24 win.</p>\n<p>The Lancer’s two Brazilian outside hitters, senior Levi Cabral and sophomore Guilherme Koepp combined for 24 kills as Cal Baptist won the third set 25-19 for the sweep.</p>\n<p>Cal Baptist was extremely efficient on offense in its last two sets, hitting for an impressive .640 clip in the second set with 17 kills, followed by a .409 hitting percentage in the final set. The Gauchos did not help themselves either, committing 16 total errors in the game compared to just eight errors for the Lancers.</p>\n<p>Junior opposite Evan Licht had another big game for UCSB. Licht led all Gauchos in kills with 13, making it the sixth time in eight games he has lead the team in kills. Senior middle blocker Dylan Davis had a subpar night for his standards, hitting only .091 with five kills and two blocks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have no time to dwell on the loss of the winning streak as it must prepare to face the top-ranked team in the nation on Friday in BYU.</p>\n<p>The Cougars enter as the only team as hot as the Gauchos before their loss against Cal Baptist. Brigham Young is currently on an 11-game winning streak and serves as a measuring stick for the Gauchos as the playoffs approach.</p>\n<p>“We know we can beat any team in our league, we proved it throughout our season,” Evans said. “We’re just going to have to take it to the teams.”</p>\n<p>In the previous match between the two teams, the Gauchos took the Cougars to the brink of defeat but were outlasted by BYU in the fifth set.</p>\n<p>In that game, four different Gauchos had double digit kills including senior outside hitter Miles Evans who had a career-high 21 kills. However, BYU’s junior outside hitter Taylor Sander had 20 kills, four digs and three blocks, which proved to be the difference in the game.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of confidence coming into the next match,” Evans said. “We know we can beat them and we really want to [win] so we can have a good chance for a good seed.”</p>\n<p>Besides serving as a measuring stick, Friday’s game against BYU will be critical in terms of seeding. The Gauchos are still in the hunt for the fourth seed in the playoffs which will grant them home court advantage. Santa Barbara has a 10-4 record at home but has struggled on the road, defeating only three conference opponents away from home and making the remaining games that more important.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are starting to feel the late season grind with only three games left in the regular season. UCSB was dealt with a devastating blow during last week’s trip to Hawaii. Evans suffered a high ankle sprain while playing against Hawaii when he stepped on sophomore middle blocker Jake Staahl’s foot.</p>\n<p>Ruled out by doctor’s for four to six weeks, the injury came as a surprise to Evans who might have played his last game as Gaucho. Evans will attempt to come back in three weeks, which will be put him on track to play in the postseason.</p>\n<p>Friday’s match against BYU is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of April 4th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50663\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50663\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-04/the-streak-ends-at-seven/","id":5335,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[5334,5333,5332],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":7,"highestPage":11,"route":"/authors/65"}},"__N_SSG":true}
