It is the first time since 2012 that UCSB has lost consecutive series. Cal Poly continues its hot start to the season and is 26-5 and 5-1 in league.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Shane Bieber delivered a solid outing yesterday, going 5.2 innings and striking out six Cal Poly batters. The only blemish on the pitcher’s afternoon came in the fourth inning, when he allowed a single and a triple to go down 1-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was the only run Cal Poly would need on the day. Sophomore Casey Bloomquist had a stellar performance on the mound and kept UCSB on check. Bloomquist pitched his way to the eighth inning while striking out 10 hitters to move to 7-0 on the season.</p>\n<p>The score in the second game resembled more of what the two best offenses in the Big West were capable of. Santa Barbara found itself down by five runs as early as the second inning but mounted a comeback in the fourth with a six-run inning. Seven hits in the inning, including a double by junior outfielder Cameron Newell, gave UCSB a 6-5 lead.</p>\n<p>The lead was short lived as Cal Poly retook the lead in the bottom half of the inning with two more runs until UCSB again tied the game 7-7.</p>\n<p>With both offenses on display through the first five innings of the game, the next three turned into a pitching duel between the two bullpens. Sophomore Kenny Chapman pitched 4.1 innings of relief and was not charged a run, striking out four with four hits allowed.</p>\n<p>Tied going into the bottom half of the ninth inning, the Mustangs put a runner on first base and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt. Sophomore pitcher Dillon Tate faced senior catcher Chris Hoo for the final out of the inning but gave up a hit up the middle for the walk-off 8-7 win.</p>\n<p>In the first game of the series, UCSB was down 2-0 going to the third inning when it quickly erased the lead on the power of back-to-back homeruns. Sophomore utility player Robby Nesovic smashed his first homer of the season with two runners on base, followed by another homerun by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa, his team-leading eighth of the season.</p>\n<p>The power surge did not end there. UCSB broke out for three more runs in the next inning to extend its lead to 7-2. It was a one-man show as senior infielder/outfielder Joey Epperson doubled to bring in two runs and scored on a wild pitch.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone exited after four innings as the righty struggled containing the potent Mustang offense. However, the Gaucho bullpen was there to pick up for Pettibone. Tate and junior Greg Mahle closed the door, pitching five innings of one-run ball for the 8-6 UCSB win.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has found itself struggling recently, losing four of its last six games.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to Caesar Uyesaka Stadium in a critical series against Big West powerhouse Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of April 7, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54685\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-13-ucsb-drops-two-at-no-5-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54685\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-13-ucsb-drops-two-at-no-5-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-13-ucsb-drops-two-at-no-5-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-13-ucsb-drops-two-at-no-5-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/no-13-ucsb-drops-two-at-no-5-cal-poly/","id":4691,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4690,4689,4688],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ready For Blue-Green Rivalry Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos play their first Big West series on the road this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With conference play now under way, the No. 13 UCSB baseball team heads to rival Cal Poly tomorrow for its first Big West road trip of the season.</p>\n<p>“It’s an important series from the standpoint that every series we play is going to be important,” senior infielder/outfielder Joey Epperson said. “There’s a good number of teams in the Big West that have a chance to win this year … It’s definitely a game with intensity and some emotion behind it.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters with a 19-5 overall record and 1-2 in Big West games after dropping the conference opening series to Hawaii.

For the Gauchos, junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa has been the team’s run producer and power hitter, leading the team with 29 RBIs and seven homeruns. Epperson is ranked second in the nation in batting average with a .478 clip and slugging an impressive .630.</p>\n<p>“I have had some success, but there’s no extra pressure on me,” Epperson said. “I kind of feel like I can just go up and put the barrel on the baseball and have a quality at-bat.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly boasts a solid lineup down the order with four hitters hitting above .300. Junior outfielder Nick Torres leads the teams with four homeruns and 28 RBIs, to go along with a .355 batting average, second-best in the lineup.</p>\n<p>With two of the best offenses squaring off against each other, pitching will be crucial with UCSB’s depth being vital in gaining the upper hand.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone made his second appearance of the year against Hawaii in his comeback from injury sustained during the offseason. Limited to pitch count, the team’s ace tossed five innings of three-hit ball and gave up no runs. Slated to pitch this weekend, Checketts will still keep the right-hander to a pitch count, albeit a higher one.</p>\n<p>“The last two [starts] were more restricted or there were certain amounts of pitches I could make,” Pettibone said. “This [start] is kind of based on how I’m feeling. If I feel good, I’ll keep going and if I don’t, then I’ll pass it on to the bullpen.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs will counter with junior Matt Imhof on the mound.

It is UCSB’s first series loss dating back to last year.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara fell behind Sunday as the Warriors jumped out to a 10-1 lead in the fourth inning, an early deficit the Gauchos could not recover from. Sophomore Domenic Mazza did not have his usual stuff on the mound, as the starter allowed eight earned runs in 3.1 innings of work while UCSB hitters failed to produce runs.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t play the best of our game, but I didn’t think we necessarily beat ourselves,” sophomore pitcher Dylan Hecht said. “They had a lot of guys that came out and beat us. We have to give credit to them.”</p>\n<p>Scoring runs was not a problem in the middle game of the series. UCSB piled on the runs in the fourth inning beginning with a two-run double by sophomore utility player Robby Nesovic, after consecutive hits put runners on second and third base. Two more triples in the inning extended the Gauchos’ lead to 6-0 heading into the fifth.</p>\n<p>Trailing 8-1 in the seventh inning, Hawaii began a thunderous comeback on a bases-loaded triple that brought three runners home and cut the deficit 8-6.</p>\n<p>Sophomore closer Dillon Tate was brought in for the two-inning save but encountered problems as well. After escaping a bases-loaded situation in the eighth inning, Tate put the go-ahead run on base, but retired the final batter on a comebacker for the 8-7 UCSB win.</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone worked effectively in his second start of the season in his comeback from injury. The team’s ace pitched five shutout innings, allowing three hits and striking out two before exiting the game.</p>\n<p>“He was outstanding. He pounded the strike zone, he had a good fastball, his breaking ball has improved from where it was last year,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “I thought he had a good feel for his changeup early in the count. He was very competitive.”</p>\n<p>Opening day of the conference season for the Gauchos was met with a stellar performance by the Warriors’ senior starting pitcher Matt Cooper. UCSB entered the game on a six-game winning streak and off to its best start since the 1984 season. However, Cooper ended the streak by tossing a complete game and allowing only one run.</p>\n<p>Not until the seventh inning did the Gauchos put a run on the board on a sacrifice bunt, but were unable to muster anymore and fell 3-1.</p>\n<p>“I think it was a series where we can learn some stuff,” Hecht said. “They beat us and we just have to go and focus on Cal Poly now because there’s nothing much you can really look into.”</p>\n<p>Despite the series loss to open Big West play, the Gauchos remain one of the top teams in the conference if their preseason record has any bearing. UCSB entered conference play with the second best non-conference record in the league, bested only by Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>After the first week of conference play, Santa Barbara ranks tied for sixth in the Big West standings with a major challenge coming next week againsst the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next series is at Cal Poly beginning Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 31, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-30/no-10-ucsb-drops-opening-big-west-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-30/no-10-ucsb-drops-opening-big-west-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-30/no-10-ucsb-drops-opening-big-west-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-30/no-10-ucsb-drops-opening-big-west-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-30/no-10-ucsb-drops-opening-big-west-series/","id":4452,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4451,4450,4449],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Heads to Arizona For Hi Corbett Classic","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3.2.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Baseball.v.Princeton-9_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3.2.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Baseball.v.Princeton-9_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Off to one of its best starts in program history, the UCSB baseball team looks to stay hot in the desert for this weekend’s tournament at Arizona University, where it will face powerhouses Mississip...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Off to one of its best starts in program history, the UCSB baseball team looks to stay hot in the desert for this weekend’s tournament at Arizona University, where it will face powerhouses Mississippi State as well as the Wildcats.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the Hi Corbett Classic winners of eight of its first nine games of the season, including six straight wins.

However, the Gauchos benefitted from two pinch-hits in the bottom of the ninth inning, one of those coming off the bat of junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who knocked in the game-winning run.</p>\n<p>Kuresa has had a hot start to the season, leading the team with 12 RBI and slugging .529 with a respectable .265 batting average. Senior infielder Joey Epperson has had even more of an impressive start to the campaign. Last week’s Big West Player of the Week leads the Gauchos with a .500 clip and .781 slugging percentage. His two home runs are tied with Kuresa for most on the team.</p>\n<p>For the UCSB pitching staff, consistency has been the theme in its recent games. The staff allowed two hits to Waseda and shutout Princeton University in the game before that. The team has averaged nearly eight strikeouts per game and a 2.54 ERA.</p>\n<p>“When they get ahead and throw strikes and they stay ahead, it gives us a good chance,” junior infielder Woody Woodward said. “They just have to put ground balls in play and we’re going to make those outs.”</p>\n<p>With UCSB’s offense and pitching coming off stellar performances, Friday’s first game against No. 12 Mississippi St. will be a highly contested matchup. The Bulldogs come in at 10-4 and winners of six straight games.</p>\n<p>Although Mississippi St. enters with a high ranking, UCSB has won against a ranked opponent this season, upsetting defending champion UCLA on the road. Still, the team’s focus remains on improving upon each game.</p>\n<p>“We try to get better every day and that’s the only thing we can control: our attitude, effort and mentality,” Woodward said.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play an afternoon contest against the Bulldogs one more time on Saturday before playing again in the evening versus the Wildcats for a double header.</p>\n<p>The hosts have a 6-7 record and will look to gain some momentum in its own tournament before the start of conference play. Arizona will play the Gauchos again on Sunday to complete the four-game weekend.</p>\n<p>First pitch on Friday against the Bulldogs is for 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of March 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54389\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/ucsb-heads-to-arizona-for-hi-corbett-classic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54389\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/ucsb-heads-to-arizona-for-hi-corbett-classic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/ucsb-heads-to-arizona-for-hi-corbett-classic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/ucsb-heads-to-arizona-for-hi-corbett-classic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/ucsb-heads-to-arizona-for-hi-corbett-classic/","id":4451,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4450,4449,4448],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Waseda University of Japan","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mens-Baseball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mens-Baseball-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeated Waseda University 2-1 in an exhibition game yesterday.

Junior pitcher Andrew Vasquez gave up a run in the first inning allowing a triple to the first hitter, followed by a sacrifice fly to advance the runner. However, that was the only damage done to UCSB.</p>\n<p>Vasquez, sophomore Robby Nesovic and junior Campbell Wear pitched the most innings for the Gauchos, going two innings each. The staff as a whole shutdown Waseda to allow only two hits on the day while striking out five.</p>\n<p>UCSB manufactured a run in the fourth inning on a two-out single by freshman catcher Dempsey Grover to tie the game at one apiece. That was the only blemish done to starting pitcher Yuhei Takanashi on the day as he exited after four innings of work that included five strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Despite being held in check, UCSB had its opportunities on offense. After consecutive singles in the sixth inning, sophomore outfielder Dalton Kelly hit into a double play to end the scoring threat for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos put together another scoring chance in the following inning when a runner reached third base on a sac bunt with one out. However, Waseda punched out the runner on third on a fielder’s choice and UCSB went down quietly.</p>\n<p>Although managing 11 hits in the game, UCSB hitters did not bring another run home until the ninth inning. With one out in the inning, freshman designated hitter Josh Adams singled to right field, followed by a pinch hit single by senior infielder Joey Epperson to put runners on second and first base.</p>\n<p>After a strikeout, Kuresa delivered the game-winning hit to right center field to win the game for UCSB. It was Kuresa’s team-leading 12th RBI of the season.</p>\n<p>Grover had the best game by a Gaucho from the plate, going 3-4 with an RBI in his third game of the season. Junior outfielder Scott Quinlan was also productive, getting two hits in four at-bats.</p>\n<p>Waseda previously defeated the university of Southern California 3-1 on Monday in the midst of a Southern California international road trip. The team will next face UCLA today.</p>\n<p>This matchup against one of the best university baseball teams in Japan was a unique opportunity for the Gauchos to face some international competition. It is certainly always a special event when teams from different nations can come together to play and celebrate a national pastime.</p>\n<p>UCSB now goes on the road to Arizona University to play powerhouses Mississippi State and Arizona in a three-team tournament this weekend. UCSB will play both teams twice with its first game against the Bulldogs at 2 p.m on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of March 5, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54353\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54353\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-04/ucsb-defeats-waseda-university-of-japan/","id":4450,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4449,4448,4447],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Hot Bats Power UCSB Sweep of Princeton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3.2.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Baseball.v.Princeton-4VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3.2.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Baseball.v.Princeton-4VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB outscored Princeton 38-11 this weekend, as the Gauchos' three-game sweep improved them to 7-1 on the year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Not even the weather can cool down the UCSB baseball team’s hot start.

However, the Gauchos broke the game open in the seventh inning, exploding for five runs to break a 10-10 tie. UCSB added on to the lead in the following inning to take the game 18-10.</p>\n<p>“We were sloppy in the field and I think we finally were able to get going,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “That was like a bad football game; our guys plugged away and we found a way to win ugly.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore Justin Jacome pitched one of his best games in the series opener on Friday. The lefty threw seven innings of shutout ball and struck out a career-high seven batters to pick up his first win of the season.</p>\n<p>Setting the tone early by striking out five of the first six hitters faced, Jacome took a no-hitter into the fifth inning before being broken up. Jacome faced the minimum in what was his second time in his career shutting out the opposing side as starting pitcher.</p>\n<p>“Our pitching staff is fantastic and we have all really good guys. There’s no drop off between the first, second and third guy,” Woodward said. “It’s a collective effort.”</p>\n<p>UCSB broke the game open in the sixth inning after already leading by two runs. The Gauchos jumped on the new relief pitcher after two batters reached second and third base. A sacrifice fly, a wild pitch and a single turned into a three-run inning for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara took advantage of a shaky Tiger bullpen and scored four runs in the eighth inning, capped off by a two-run homerun by senior third baseman Joey Epperson. UCSB took the game 9-1.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for Tuesday’s contest against Waseda University of Japan.

The win marked the first road victory against the Bruins since 2011 and the program’s first win against a defending champ since 1999.</p>\n<p>In that game, Santa Barbara had a solid outing from sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza who went into the sixth inning allowing only two runs to the potent Bruin offense. UCSB also benefitted from timely hitting by junior infielders Tyler Kuresa and Pete Maris who each went deep: Together they accounted for five of UCSB’s six runs in the game.</p>\n<p>So far in the season, the Gauchos have relied on its bullpen to get them out of trouble in late game situations. Sophomore Dillon Tate has converted on both of his save opportunities and junior Greg Mahle is developing into a reliable setup man for Tate. Before Tuesday’s game, the bullpen came in with a 2.40 ERA.</p>\n<p>UCSB has been on an offensive tear as of late, as it has put up a combined 16 runs in its past two games. Senior third baseman Joey Epperson has excelled at the top of the lineup and leads the team with a .450 batting average, while Kuresa has been the Gaucho’s power hitter with two homeruns in five games.</p>\n<p>In its first game of the season, Princeton enters looking to improve on last year’s 14-28 finish where the team was mostly hurt by its fielding errors; the Tigers had the most in their conference with 74.</p>\n<p>Although being among the middle of the conference in batting average and ERA last season, the Tigers return players capable of becoming big threats this season. Senior infielder/outfielder Alec Keller batted .378 with four homeruns and will be counted on to lead the offensive production for the young Princeton squad this year.</p>\n<p>Another potential threat in the lineup of the Tigers is sophomore infielder Danny Hoy who managed a .307 batting average to go along with 21 RBIs and two homers.</p>\n<p>On the mound, sophomore Cameron Mingo will have to step up for the Tigers after the loss of their two best pitchers from last year. The right-handed pitcher posted an ERA of 2.92 and 1-4 record last season and is one of the best prospects in the Tiger’s conference.</p>\n<p>Friday’s opening game at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium is scheduled for 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54236\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54236\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-look-to-continue-strong-start-to-season-against-princeton/","id":4437,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4436,4435,4434],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Defending Champs UCLA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-PLEASE-CROP-TO-SUPER-VERTICAL-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-PLEASE-CROP-TO-SUPER-VERTICAL-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos beat UCLA 6-4 on the road","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It may be a month away from conference season, but the UCSB baseball team sent a major statement to the Big West last night, defeating defending champion UCLA on the road 6-4.</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 4-1 on the season with the win, with three of the victories coming away from home.

However, Hecht had his usual stuff on display against the Spartans.</p>\n<p>Hecht did not allow an earned run through six innings of work and walked only two batters with four strikeouts.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the offense for the Gauchos was clicking from the beginning of the first inning. Sophomore designated hitter Robby Nesovic brought in two runs home on a hit and then scored on a single by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa, giving the Gauchos a 3-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Behind the arm of Hecht, UCSB tacked on to the lead in the second inning with one run, and an additional three more runs in the fourth inning. Santa Barbara added three more runs later in the game and won the contest 10-1.</p>\n<p>Nesovic went 3-5 from the plate with two RBIs.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s afternoon game was a close affair until the seventh inning, when SJSU broke a 3-3 deadlock. Sophomore pitcher Hector Lujan gave up a hit and walk before being pulled out from the game.</p>\n<p>The Spartans loaded the bases after another walk allowed, putting catcher Kyle Gallegos at the plate. Gallegos hit a clutch double, giving San Jose a two-run lead going into the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara responded with two runs to even the match. However, UCSB put itself into a further hole in the bottom half of the inning when they allowed two more runs giving San Jose a 7-5 advantage.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara could not come up with the needed runs in the final and dropped the decision.</p>\n<p>Despite getting 16 hits in the game, UCSB couldn’t get the timely hits it needed to pull ahead. Junior right fielder Scott Quilan had the best performance from the plate, going 3-5.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Justin Jacome took the mound for the Gauchos in the opening game of the series. The lefty threw six solid innings, giving up two earned runs, two walks and four strikeouts before being lifted.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara got on the board in the second inning on a single by freshman outfielder Andrew Calica, who brought a runner home from third base. San Jose scored in the bottom half of the inning to tie the game at one apiece.</p>\n<p>Held scoreless for the next five innings, the Gauchos put a runner in scoring position with two outs, trailing by one run. Kuresa delivered the game-tying single UCSB needed that sent the game into extra innings.</p>\n<p>After a scoreless ninth inning pitched by sophomore Greg Mahle, the Gauchos started the tenth inning with a runner on second base after a walk and sacrifice. Nesovic came up to at-bat and doubled down the line to give UCSB the 3-2 win.</p>\n<p>The win extended the Gauchos’ win streak against the Spartans to eight games, dating back to the 2011 season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will have another non-conference game on Tuesday against defending champion UCLA. Game time is scheduled for 6 p.m. in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Mercurio led the team in hits last season and is currently hitting .400, while Carroll has the team’s only homerun so far.</p>\n<p>Mercurio and Carroll are but a few of the returning players from last season as 14 freshmen make up the Spartans’ 20 man roster.

In its last two seasons UCSB has swept the Spartans.</p>\n<p>In its previous game, the Gauchos relied on the arms of their bullpen after starting pitcher, sophomore Dylan Hecht, struggled with his command, giving up four walks and having two wild pitches in four innings played.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Hector Lujan came in relief and pitched three impressive innings, allowing just one runner to get on base and striking out five batters in three innings on the mound. Junior Greg Mahle and sophomore Dillion Tate came in the last two innings in relief.</p>\n<p>UCSB was relatively quiet on offense except for a momentum changing homerun by junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa in the third inning. The three-run blast came as Cal State Bakersfield allowed two runners on base after previously not scoring on a bases loaded situation in the top half of the inning.</p>\n<p>The homerun was all UCSB needed to secure the win, but added additional runs in the sixth and eighth inning to seal the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB will rely on a combination of a deep pitching rotation and small ball to counter San Jose’s home field advantage.</p>\n<p>Game time for the first game between the teams is for Friday at 6 p.m., with games on Saturday and Sunday beginning at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54110\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-hit-the-road-to-face-san-jose-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54110\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-hit-the-road-to-face-san-jose-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-hit-the-road-to-face-san-jose-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-hit-the-road-to-face-san-jose-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/gauchos-hit-the-road-to-face-san-jose-state/","id":4692,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4691,4690,4689],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Its Season With a Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-v-CSUB-peter-vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baseball-v-CSUB-peter-vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=797%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos beat Cal State Bakersfield 5-1","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its first game of the season, the UCSB baseball team defeated Cal State Bakersfield 5-1 on the strength of its bullpen after a rocky performance from its starting pitcher.</p>\n<p>Sophomore pitcher Dylan Hecht, the team’s best pitcher coming into the season, put UCSB in an early hole until the Gauchos responded with a three-run homerun that proved to be the difference in the game.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t look like himself.

We had really quality relief from Hector Lujan and Greg Mahle.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will continue its schedule this Friday on the road in its first three-game series of the season against San Jose State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 19th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54066\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54066\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/ucsb-opens-its-season-with-a-victory/","id":4690,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4689,4688,4687],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Baseball Set to Build on Last Season’s Success","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After being selected to the NCAA Tournament last season, the UCSB baseball team hopes to further build on that success as the 2014 season opens this week.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Led by a core group of veterans and a talented crop of incoming players, the UCSB baseball team is focused on the bigger picture this year.

UCSB will rely on a deep pitching rotation that returns nine hurlers, including the entire rotation from 2013 and the backend of the bullpen.</p>\n<p>Despite the staff being without star junior pitcher Austin Pettibone for the first month of the season after he suffered a shoulder injury, UCSB has enough arms to make up for his absence. Looking to fill in the role will be sophomore pitcher Dylan Hecht, who moves from closer to the top of the team’s rotation.</p>\n<p>Last season, Hecht emerged as one of the top closers in the Big West. With a fastball that can reach 97 mph, Hecht earned nine saves and finished with a 1.83 ERA on his way to earning All-Big West honors. Joining Hecht in the rotation will be sophomores Justin Jacome and Robbie Nesovic; each are coming off solid freshman campaigns.</p>\n<p>“We’re really deep, there’s kind of no separation between some of our starters, our middle relief and closer,” Checketts said. “We’ve got some depth. We’re 10 to 12 deep, and they’re competitive.”</p>\n<p>Pitching wasn’t the only weapon in the Gauchos’ arsenal last season, as its offense was in the top three in most Big West offensive categories. Under hitting coach Jason Hawkins, the Gauchos were near the top in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and home runs.</p>\n<p>Junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa appeared in all games for UCSB last season and led the team in hits, home runs, RBIs and slugging percentage. Kuresa will be joined by Nesovic who does double duty as a utility player. Nesovic ended last year’s campaign with a .326 batting average and 33 RBIs on his way to receiving Big West Freshman Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>With a similar approach on offense this year, the Gauchos will rely more on small ball to generate runs on the board rather than trying to hit for the fences.</p>\n<p>“We have a pretty solid lineup one through nine. We like to run and hit-and-run, we attempt to run a more West Coast Offense,” Checketts said. “I think you’ll see some [power] out of the middle of the order, but not an unbelievable amount.”</p>\n<p>The schedule will not be easy for the Gauchos who will be tested from the start. Already in a conference that features baseball powerhouse Cal State Fullerton, UCSB will also face off against defending national champion UCLA and other notable opponents such as Arizona and Mississippi State.</p>\n<p>After its opening game against NC State was cancelled, the Gauchos will open the season next week.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54006\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/baseball-set-to-build-on-last-seasons-success/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54006\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/baseball-set-to-build-on-last-seasons-success/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/baseball-set-to-build-on-last-seasons-success/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/baseball-set-to-build-on-last-seasons-success/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/baseball-set-to-build-on-last-seasons-success/","id":4689,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4688,4687,4686],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Super Bowl XLVIII: One Game,  Plenty of New Legacies","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/football.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/football.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Peyton Manning Still a Remarkable QB","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The clock ran down to zero, the Gatorade was dumped on the coach and the confetti began falling, bringing an end to another football season.

Not for him and not for his critics. The big question that remains is how the loss will reflect upon Manning’s legacy.</p>\n<p>There is no denying that Manning is unquestionably one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever suit up in the NFL. But in this league, and in sports in general, a player’s greatness is evaluated by how many rings he has.</p>\n<p>However, what separates Manning from the rest is that he didn’t need to win to solidify his legacy. Countless broken records and one Super Bowl title is already enough for Manning to claim his place among the greatest who ever played the game.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself this, would you place Eli Manning, who has two Super Bowl titles, ahead of big brother Peyton?</p>\n<p>Although the Broncos might have lost in a humiliating fashion that no one saw coming, how much can that actually change what Manning has accomplished over his career? Not much. He has achieved what no other quarterback has done during his era has, and that is something worth noting in a pass-happy league.</p>\n<p>The knock on Manning will remain that he is the greatest regular season quarterback ever. But think about it, how many players can lead a team to the best record for two-straight years after coming off a career-threatening neck injury? That alone should give you some insight into Manning’s greatness, and he did it at 37 years of age.</p>\n<p>Looking back at the game, it wasn’t all Manning’s fault. It’s easy to point fingers at only the quarterback and the coach in football. Yet, a quarterback is only as good as the supporting cast around him, and that supporting cast that showed up for the first 18 games of the season was nowhere to be found in the last game of the year.</p>\n<p>No one could have predicted that the first play of the game would result in a botched snap going over the head of Manning and turning into a safety. Manning sure didn’t.</p>\n<p>The explosive wide receiver core of Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker trembled and looked flustered by the Legion of Boom, and the offensive line did little to help Manning throw his signature passes.</p>\n<p>The Broncos defense wasn’t much help either. Seattle hadn’t been putting up points in its run-up to the Super Bowl, yet the Broncos’ defense gave up two touchdowns through the air, one on the ground, one on a kick return and had a bunch of missed tackles.</p>\n<p>The Broncos were outplayed by a defense that was built to counter its record-setting offense. It’s as simple as that. The better team won and it showed throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this wasn’t the storybook ending Peyton Manning and fans had hoped for. Numerous people dreamed of Peyton going out on top just like John Elway did after he lost his first three Super Bowls for Denver.</p>\n<p>The Broncos are still a young, talented team with much to improve on and under the leadership of Elway, the Broncos will still be a contender. For Peyton, at least he knows there’s someone in the organization who knows how he feels right about now and will give him the tools to get back.</p>\n<p>So, is Peyton one of the greatest to play? Yes. Is he the greatest of all-time? Not right now, but there’s always next season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of Feb. 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>Since Callero took over the program five years ago, his team has had the reputation of being the grittiest team in the conference. Last season’s postseason appearance, the first ever in school history, is a testament to the Mustang’s slow style of play. Relying on more of the same defensive tenacity this season, Cal Poly looks to exceed its predicted third-place finish in the preseason media poll.</p>\n<p>“[The style of play] has been successful a few years, I think it’s going to continue to be successful,” Callero said. “It really speaks to our commitment to defense, rebounding and being smart on the offensive end.”</p>\n<p>Leading the league in defense for the past three seasons has not come at the expense of poor offense for Cal Poly. Scoring has come by way of First-Team Big West selection, senior forward Chris Eversley. With team averages in points (14.0) and rebounds (7.2), Eversley is expected to be one of the best players in the league this year.</p>\n<p>“Chris is a First-Team All-Conference player, I think he has the chance to repeat that honor, but it also goes hand in hand with team success,” Callero said.</p>\n<p>Aside from Eversley, the tandem of wing player David Nwaba and sophomore forward Brian Bennett make up one of the strongest frontcourts in the league. Last season, Bennett shot 52.4 percent from the field and averaged 9.3 points per game, while Nwaba, despite being a transfer, is second on the team in points (11.5) and rebounds (4.5).</p>\n<p>Even with its defense and talent, Cal Poly is coming into conference play on a four-game losing skid ahead of its conference opener against Hawaii on Thursday. With a record of 4-9, the Mustangs’ biggest weakness has come when playing on the road. After Saturday’s road loss against Delaware, the team has fallen to 0-7 when away from home with all the losses coming by double digits.</p>\n<p>“We still haven’t hit our stride, and we like to hopefully play our best basketball during conference play and then during playoffs,” Callero said.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly has however notched impressive wins against Santa Clara (64-53) and Cal State Dominguez Hills (85-49). In spite of its record, Cal Poly ends its nonconference schedule first in Big West in defensive scoring (65.2) and has proven to take care of the ball, turning the ball over the least of any team in the conference (10.6).</p>\n<p>Cal Poly begins Big West play at home on Thursday against Hawaii and meets UCSB in the season’s first installment of the Blue-Green rivalry on Saturday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-preview-cal-poly-mens-basketball/","id":600,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[599,598,597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dolphins’ Locker Room Antics Show Flaw in NFL","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/incognito.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A look at the Miami Dolphins' bullying scandal.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the NFL you are supposed to channel all your aggression and violence toward your opponent — not your teammate. That is a pretty simple idea in football. Bully the guys with the different colored jerseys, not the ones that carry around the same helmet as you.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in between, Richie Incognito of the Miami Dolphins forgot all about that and it has potentially cost not only his career, but it has jeopardized the career of one of his teammates, his coaching staff and discredited one of the proudest franchises in the NFL.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t heard, Incognito has been suspended indefinitely by the Miami Dolphins for unspecified misconduct against a teammate. That teammate is Jonathan Martin, a second-year player out of Stanford who is biracial, and that unspecified misconduct is leaving threatening voicemails and texts messages for Martin that includes the use of racial slurs and attacks on Martin’s family.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Incognito’s misconduct Martin forced to leave the team, after no longer being able to deal with the constant racial slurs and threats against his life and family. Martin hired a lawyer who released Incognito’s messages to Martin, a move that has stirred up controversy in a league that prides itself in keeping player issues behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>Say what you will about football being a “man’s sport” or the fact that Martin should have handled this situation inside of the locker room. When someone work in an environment where racial slurs and threats are part of the norm, something needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>What is even more shocking is that teammates have come in support of Incognito, dismissing his threats and racial epithets.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross has come to the defense of Martin and rightly so, because whatever locker room culture the Dolphins have created over the past years leading up to this situation is not normal — far from it.</p>\n<p>If the players of the Dolphins actually support Incognito and his use of racial slurs, then that says something about the nature of the Dolphins locker room and what exactly is allowed to go on in there. Not only that, it shows the lack of leadership on the team. If football really is a man’s game, it’s time for the Dolphins players to start acting like men.</p>\n<p>Ross has formed his own task force of former Miami Dolphin greats such as Don Shula, Dan Marino, Jason Taylor and highly respected NFL figures, such as former head coach Tony Dungy. Their job will be to analyze exactly what was going on in the Miami locker room and most importantly, establish a code of conduct for the team, because clearly the team is in need.</p>\n<p>For Ross, this is a step in the right direction not just for his franchise, but for all of the NFL, because if this is happening in one locker room it is more than likely happening to more teams.</p>\n<p>Expect NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to come down hard on the Miami Dolphins and that includes excessive fines and suspensions. Dolphins Head Coach Joe Philbin will likely be out of a job for being oblivious to what was going on in his own locker room and General Manager Jeff Ireland in all likelihood will also be out of a job.</p>\n<p>In his first sit-down interview, Incognito insisted he is not racist and did not apologize for his actions. Incognito has also said that Martin sent him messages with the same type of language. This is a poor defense to hide behind extreme behavior encouraged by teammates and does not justify his actions.</p>\n<p>The big picture is this — any type of bullying inside the locker room has no place in the NFL or any other sport for that matter. It is up to the Miami Dolphins organization and the NFL to correct this situation and prevent it from happening in the future.</p>\n<p>Martin is now currently in Los Angeles receiving counseling and a report came out yesterday that Martin wants to play professional football again, just not this year and of course not with the Dolphins. Though Martin is just 24 and a former second-round draft pick, the question to ask is which team will bring him in considering the potential risk he can bring to a team after seeing what the Miami Dolphins are now under.</p>\n<p>Some players will definitely be against the idea and many general managers would not like the distraction from the media Martin would bring. Until then, you can only hope that the league will be there for Martin because that was clearly missing in Miami.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 14, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Vicky Kohatsu of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52925\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52925\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/dolphins-locker-room-antics-show-flaw-in-nfl/","id":3243,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[3242,3241,3240],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":5,"highestPage":11,"route":"/authors/65"}},"__N_SSG":true}
