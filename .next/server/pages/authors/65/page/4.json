The Gauchos will have to win their six remaining games to do so.</p>\n<p>Already in desperation mode entering the game, Head Coach Andrew Checketts opted for a pitching change in the first inning after sophomore starting pitcher Domenic Mazza gave up UCSB’s 2-0 lead on a RBI groundout and a homerun.</p>\n<p>Sophomore designated hitter/relief pitcher Greg Mahle came in to stop the bleeding, but not before he ran into trouble in the fourth inning.</p>\n<p>With UCSB down by a run, Mahle allowed the runner on second base to score on a double down the left field line, forcing Checketts to make another pitching change.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine began separating itself from there on despite sophomore closer Dillon Tate taking over on the mound. The right-hander salvaged the inning by allowing only one more batter to cross the plate on a wild pitch. However, Pepperdine extended its lead to 6-2.</p>\n<p>The game got even uglier for the Gauchos after that. After the Waves managed only one run on a bases-loaded situation in the fifth inning, they broke the game completely open in the next three innings.</p>\n<p>Senior relief pitcher Cameron Cuneo took over in the sixth and loaded the bases with one out. Cuneo then walked the next batter before Checketts made another call to the pen.</p>\n<p>The move did not pay off as the next batter also walked with the bases loaded. In total, the Waves earned two runs on only one hit in that inning.</p>\n<p>While UCSB attempted to find the right combination on the mound, the Waves’ sophomore starting pitcher Jackson McClelland was in complete control of his game.</p>\n<p>Through six innings of work, McClelland allowed only two runs on five hits, striking out seven batters and walking only two to improve his record to 7-3.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara put an end to its scoring drought in the top half of the seventh with a three-run inning.</p>\n<p>Sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic had an infield single with the bases loaded and two outs to earn the first run and junior right fielder Cameron Newell hit a two-run single to tack on more runs for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Pepperdine put a stamp to the game in the bottom half of the inning with a two-run homerun that pushed its run total into the double-digit range. With one more run in the eighth, the Waves finished the game with a total of 12 runs.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara did have standout performances from two of its players. Junior shortstop Peter Maris hit 2-5 and Nesovic went 2-4 from the plate and one of three Gauchos to earn at least one RBI in the game.</p>\n<p>UCSB plays again this weekend against San Francisco in a non-conference series.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 14, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55296\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55296\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/gauchos-suffer-road-loss-at-pepperdine/","id":4431,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4430,4429,4428],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Beat CSUN in Final Home Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballDustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos' playoff hopes in danger after failing to sweep CSUN.

Freshman starting pitcher Shane Bieber managed to escape the inning, but the damage was done for UCSB. The Gauchos manufactured only one run in the sixth inning on a RBI hit by sophomore designated hitter/pitcher Greg Mahle.</p>\n<p>“We weren’t ready to go defensively and then we couldn’t adjust offensively later,” Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. “They weren’t flat. They had energy, but their concentration level probably wasn’t where it needed to be.”</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Austin Pettibone’s complete-game shutout on Saturday clinched the series for the Gauchos as the team won 6-0. The right-hander delivered his best outing of the season, facing only 30 batters and throwing 85 pitches to pick up the win and improve to 3-1 on the year.</p>\n<p>“He had everything working today. He hit all his spots and when he does that he’s pretty unhittable,” senior left fielder Joey Epperson said. “The fastball was coming out of his hand well. He did a good job of being deceptive at times and throwing pitches where he wants in the strike zone.”</p>\n<p>UCSB led 2-0 in the eighth inning before adding four big insurance runs to extend its lead. After junior right fielder Cameron Newell scored from second base on a throwing error, the top half of Santa Barbara’s lineup capitalized on senior relief pitcher Michael Coates’s poor outing on the mound.</p>\n<p>Coates allowed two runs on a RBI triple by Maris and a double by Epperson, which drove Coates out of the game. Sophomore third baseman Robby Nesovic capped off the inning with a single to bring Epperson home.<br>\nSanta Barbara previously scored two runs in the fourth inning on a two-run homerun by Epperson. With a runner on second base, Epperson smashed the ball opposite-field for his fourth homer on the year and first since March 16.</p>\n<p>“In that situation, mainly I was just trying put the barrel to the baseball and find a way to get that run in,” Epperson said. “And I wound up taking a good swing on the ball and it left the yard. With Pettibone pitching that was really all we needed.”</p>\n<p>In the first game of the series on Friday, the Gauchos’ four runs in the third inning was just enough, with the final score ending 4-3 in favor of UCSB. Newell singled to get the third inning started for the Gauchos and scored two outs later on a hit to the left side by Maris.</p>\n<p>CSUN’s senior pitcher Brycen Rutherford followed the Maris single by loading the bases, setting the stage for a two-run RBI hit from Nesovic. Freshman center fielder Andrew Calica singled one more time in the inning to give UCSB a 4-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara’s lineup gave UCSB the lead, Mahle’s versatility in the batter’s box and on the mound proved to be the difference in the game. After sophomore starting pitcher Justin Jacome gave up three runs in the sixth inning, Mahle came in relief with the bases loaded and pitched out of the jam to maintain UCSB’s lead.</p>\n<p>Mahle filled the stat sheet on the day. From the plate, Mahle went 2-3 with a walk and a run scored. His two innings pitched in relief secured the lead before sophomore closer Dillon Tate came on in the eighth and ninth inning to close the door on the Matadors.</p>\n<p>UCSB is back in action Tuesday against Pepperdine. The game is of critical importance in terms of UCSB qualifying for the NCAA tournament, given that the Waves are the last opponent the Gauchos will face with an RPI of above 40. Teams with an RPI above 40 have a considerable shot at earning an at-large bid, and as of now, Santa Barbara has an RPI of 52.</p>\n<p>First pitch tomorrow is set for 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 12, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55266\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55266\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-12/gauchos-beat-csun-in-final-home-series/","id":4432,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4431,4430,4429],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Matadors for Senior Day","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsUCR-DustinHarris-04252014-01.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Baseball_vsUCR-DustinHarris-04252014-01.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB plays in its final home series of the season against CSUN.

Santa Barbara began the year with its second-best start in program history at 18-3 and ranked as high as No. 10. Since then, however, UCSB has been in a tail-spin, losing four of six conference series.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos reached their low point of the season last weekend when they were swept by first-place UC Irvine in a series critical for Big West positioning. Before Tuesday’s win at Bakersfield, UCSB was held from winning its previous four games, the longest stretch the team had gone without winning this season.</p>\n<p>A big reason for UCSB’s struggles has been a lack of quality innings from its starting pitching. Against the Anteaters, Santa Barbara starting pitching combined to allow 12 runs in 12.1 innings of work, while the bullpen gave up a total of five runs in 10.5 innings of relief.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Gauchos’ relief pitching has been the most consistent facet of this year’s team. Despite giving up a late lead to UCI last weekend in the second game of the series, the bullpen had previously pitched the Gauchos into having a 20-0 record when leading after the sixth inning.</p>\n<p>The duo of sophomore relief pitchers Greg Mahle and Dillon Tate have provided a solid tandem in the back end of the bullpen for UCSB. Besides their reliability, the two have been workhorses for the team. Mahle ranks first in conference appearances by a pitcher with 13 and is coming off his longest outing where he pitched six shutout innings of two-hit ball in the series finale against Irvine.</p>\n<p>Mahle’s standout year has taken a backseat to Tate’s own outstanding season. Tate is second behind Mahle in conference appearances by a pitcher with 11 and after pitching three scoreless innings against Bakersfield, he lowered his ERA to 0.55. The shutdown closer has allowed just one earned run in 21 of his 22 outings this year.</p>\n<p>UCSB will also need to put more runs on the board against a team that ranks second to last in the conference in ERA at 3.64. Recently, junior shortstop Peter Maris has been the best hitter for the Gauchos. In his last eight games he has hit .362, including collecting three hits and two RBI against CSUB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has done significantly better at home than on the road and will look to take advantage of the Matadors’ troubles away from home. CSUN is 5-17 on the road.</p>\n<p>Aside from home field advantage, the team will also honor four of its seniors for Senior Day, including starting catcher Jackson Morrow and left fielder Joey Epperson, who leads the team with a .384 batting average.</p>\n<p>First game of the series is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. on Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 8, 2014’s print edition of  </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55217\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55217\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/gauchos-host-matadors-for-senior-day/","id":4430,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4429,4428,4427],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Late Surge Pushes UCSB to Victory","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Four runs in the eighth inning propelled the Gauchos to a 7-3 win over Cal State Bakersfield.

With the bases still loaded, senior left fielder Joey Epperson grounded out to score the runner from third and the next hitter, junior shortstop Peter Maris, doubled down the right field line to extend Santa Barbara’s lead to four runs.</p>\n<p>Sophomore relief pitcher Dillon Tate took over from there for the Gauchos. The right-hander had an easy 1-2-3 inning in the bottom of the eighth and quickly took care of business in the final inning by retiring the side in order. Tate pitched three innings of relief in total and gave up only one hit.</p>\n<p>Bakersfield had originally put the game in a deadlock in the sixth inning as sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza ran out of gas towards the end of his start. A single by the Roadrunners followed by a groundout advanced the runner to second base and into scoring position.</p>\n<p>Needing just one more out to escape the threat, Mazza allowed another single to put the game at 3-3.</p>\n<p>The game-tying run ended a three-inning scoring drought by both sides. Santa Barbara previously led 3-2 by scoring two runs on three hits and an error in the second inning. Epperson had an RBI single and Morrow later scored from third base on a pass ball.</p>\n<p>In the first inning, UCSB took the lead by tacking a run on a two-out RBI by junior designated hitter Greg Mahle. Mahle, who has had an impressive year pitching from the bullpen, was in the lineup in Tuesday’s game and singled through the right side to send Maris home from second base. Maris had previously doubled in his at-bat.</p>\n<p>The lead was short-lived as Bakersfield took the lead with two runs in the bottom half of the inning. With runners on first and second base, Mazza picked off the runner from first but allowed a triple to the next batter to tie the game at one apiece. Mazza gave up another extra-base hit before the inning ended to give CSUB a 2-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>UCSB now turns to this weekend when it will play Cal State Northridge for the final three-game set at home starting Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 7th’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55180\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55180\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/late-surge-pushes-ucsb-to-victory/","id":4419,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4418,4417,4416],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Brings in 10 Talented Freshmen for Next Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10.6.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-Peter-Vandenbelt-2.jpeg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos bring in young crop of forwards, defenders and goalkeepers for 2014 season.

Despite losing only five seniors from the roster to graduation, this recruiting class will try to fill the holes left in the forward and backline positions.</p>\n<p>Attempting to step up in the forward position will be Amanda Ball from Chino Hills High School, who headlines the class. Ball will have an opportunity to start right away and looks to fill the shoes of graduating senior forward Allie Ariniello, who tied for most goals on the team last year. Her athleticism and playmaking abilities up top make her a huge threat in the scoring department for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I think we finally bring in — in Amanda Ball — something we have not had for a while,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “And that’s a very athletic, a very smart and a very technical soccer player, who is going to score a number of goals herself.

Brittney McKinney from Chaminade Prep in Woodland Hills, CA, is a player with a knack of putting the ball on frame and finished within the top 10 in her high school’s scoring list.</p>\n<p>Jordan Alves from Mary Star of the Sea High School can play in the forward and center midfielder position and can provide some versatility in the position. The San Pedro, CA native is in the discussion for possibly earning playing time in her first year. Recently committed Zoe Purcell from Torrey Pines High School, will add another option at the forward position for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We have not done a great job of scoring many goals the last couple of years,” Stumpf said. “We specifically went after some goal scorers that we thought were going to help us right away.”</p>\n<p>Defense, the strongest suit for UCSB last season, will lose three key leaders. The departure of Taylor Gehring and the Gankema twins, Paige and Lindsay, will most likely be filled by returning players, says Stumpf.</p>\n<p>However, Chace Schornstein from Redwood High School has potential to battle for a starting role, along with Kate Shoemaker from Poway High School in San Diego. The two use their size and physicality to keep the ball away from attackers.</p>\n<p>Despite a breakout season from junior Beth Ritter in between the goal posts last year, the Gauchos welcome three recruits in goalkeeping that can potentially threaten Ritter’s starting role. At 5’8”, Hannah Frogge from Bishop McGuinness High School in Oklahoma has the ideal frame for a goalkeeper and has athleticism to go with it. She had an impressive 90 percent save percentage her senior year.</p>\n<p>Remi White from Monte Vista High School and Brittney Rogers out of Murrieta Valley High School will also be in the goalkeeper rotation.</p>\n<p>“[Frogge is] going to come in and she’s going to challenge the two returning keepers pretty much right away in goal,” Stumpf said. “The other two goal keepers coming in — Remi White and Brittney Rogers — most likely, an educated guess will tell me they’re going to be backups at least their first years.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of May 8, 2014’s print edition of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of</em> The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/ucsb-brings-in-10-talented-freshmen-for-next-season/","id":1572,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1571,1570,1569],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Three Straight in Sweep","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/baseball21.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/baseball21.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos are in sixth place with six Big West games remaining.

Santa Barbara previously had a 19-0 record when leading after six innings, but sophomore closer Dillon Tate allowed the game-winning single to the first batter he faced in the eighth inning.</p>\n<p>UCSB held Irvine scoreless entering the seventh inning up by two runs until UCI began its comeback. Junior third baseman Robby Nesovic committed a throwing error to first base, allowing the runner on third to advance and tie the game after UCI earned its first run on a RBI groundout.</p>\n<p>The two runs were charged to junior pitcher Austin Pettibone, who exited the game after allowing hits to the first two batters of the inning. Pettibone worked efficiently other than his final inning pitched. The right-hander commanded the strike zone to keep the Anteaters off the board, but ran out of gas towards the end. He finished with 6.1 innings pitched, four strikeouts and two walks allowed.</p>\n<p>Junior second baseman Woody Woodward came to bat in the second inning with a runner in scoring position to earn the game’s first run on a RBI single to center field. Not until the fifth inning did we see any scoring from either side. Senior left fielder Joey Epperson knocked in a run on only his third hit of his last 26 plate appearances against a conference opponent to give the Gauchos a 2-0 lead at the time.</p>\n<p>Irvine jumped out to a two-run lead in the second inning of the series’ first game on three hits off of starting sophomore pitcher Justin Jacome. UCSB, however, was quick to counter with two runs of its own in the following inning to tie the contest at two runs apiece.</p>\n<p>Junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa knocked in both runs with a bases-loaded, two-out single to right center field. In putting up two runs on the scoreboard, Santa Barbara became just the fourth team this season to score multiple runs against UCI’s senior pitcher Andrew Morales.</p>\n<p>Jacome ran into trouble again in the fifth inning, first by allowing a single and a walk, then by giving up a two-run RBI double to junior first baseman Connor Spencer for a 4-2 Anteater lead.

It’s the same mentality going into this weekend as any weekend.”</p>\n<p>UC Irvine comes into the weekend’s contest as the hottest team in the conference with an 11-1 league and 29-14 overall record on the year after defeating USC in a one-game series on Tuesday. Prior to that game, UCI swept three of its four conference series with its lone loss coming against UC Riverside. However, the Anteaters’ conference record at this point might not reflect the team’s true identity.</p>\n<p>Irvine has preyed on the lesser teams of the conference and has yet to face a ranked Big West opponent. This series against the Gauchos marks the beginning of a tough stretch of ranked conference opponents for UCI, which has to play Cal Poly and Cal State Fullerton to close out the regular season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have been hurt by inconsistent starting pitching that has resulted in the team playing from behind on many occasions. UCSB will need its pitchers to go deeper into games and command the strike zone against an Anteater team that features many threats on offense. Among those hitters is junior first baseman Connor Spencer, who leads the team with a .366 batting average and 33 RBI.</p>\n<p>UCSB will send out its same three starting pitchers it did in its previous conference series. Sophomore Justin Jacome will take the mound in game one after displaying a solid outing in his last start. In that performance against UC Riverside, Jacome pitched into the seventh inning and allowed only two runs to pick up his fifth win of the year.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Pettibone will try to bounce back from a subpar start last week. The Gauchos’ ace was not his usual self in his last game as he allowed five runners to reach home plate, which raised his ERA to 4.94. Freshman Shane Bieber will take the mound in the third game of the series.</p>\n<p>Besides pitching playing a key role in gaining the upper hand, the Gauchos will also need to perform better offensively to come out with a series win.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to have be better at executing,” Checketts said. “It’s a difficult park to score in and they have good pitching, so we’re going to have to be able to [play] short game and be able to bunt and be able to execute hit-and-runs and do the little things we didn’t do against [UCLA].”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Anteaters enter in first place primarily due to their pitching. Irvine has a combined 2.50 ERA and senior Andrew Morales leads the staff with the nation’s third-best ERA at 0.78.</p>\n<p>If UCSB establishes a lead in the final innings of any of its games, the team has an excellent track record of closing the door on its opponents because of its bullpen. Junior relief pitcher Greg Mahle has excelled in his role as setup man for the Gauchos this year. In 24 appearances, Mahle has a 1.90 ERA to go along with 30 strikeouts. Against the Bruins, Mahle retired the six batters he faced without trouble.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s most consistent pitcher all year long however, has been sophomore closer Dillon Tate. Tate has served as the lights-out stopper coming out of the pen for UCSB this year. To put into perspective how dominant the hurler has been so far, he has struck out 39 batters in only 29.1 innings of work. Tate had his longest outing of the season against UCLA, throwing four innings of shutout ball before the game was called a draw.</p>\n<p>Despite pitching four innings on Tuesday, Tate will be available to pitch as early as the first game of the series if the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n<p>“He went through 56 pitches [against UCLA]. He should be able to bounce back and be okay,” Checketts said. “It probably won’t be a long save. We usually don’t use him long on Friday, but if he has a save opportunity I think he’ll be available.”</p>\n<p>First pitch at Irvine is scheduled for tomorrow at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of May 1st’s print edition of The Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of The Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/chasing-a-ticket-to-the-postseason/","id":4414,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4413,4412,4411],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos and Bruins Tie in 12 Innings","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballDustinHarris1.jpg?resize=533%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB and UCLA tied after 12 innings of play due to darkness coming over Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Yesterday was a missed opportunity for the No. 24 UCSB baseball team.

With runners on second and third base, UCLA managed to earn the game’s first run with a single, followed by a two-run RBI that chased Vasquez from the game. UCLA would put up one more run after the pitching change as Vasquez was charged with all four runs despite allowing only three hits in total.</p>\n<p>“His stuff wasn’t very good. I think he was a little flat,” Checketts said. “His command was just okay. He didn’t have great stuff today. The ball wasn’t coming out of his hand very good.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara began clawing its way back into the game by scoring a run in the bottom half of the inning. After a walk and double that put two runners in scoring position, UCLA retired the next two batters but allowed a run on a fielding error that brought UCSB within three runs.</p>\n<p>Down 4-1 in the third inning, the Gauchos tied the score with one swing of the bat. With two runners on base, junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa smashed a three-run blast over the right field fence for his team-leading ninth homerun of the season. It was his first since April 4 after he went a stretch of 37 at-bats without hitting one.</p>\n<p>“I was trying to get something up in the zone, something elevated,” Kuresa said. “We had a runner on third with one out; I was just trying to hit a sac-fly and not a double play. I was pretty surprised he gave me a fastball there. He missed over the middle, and I put a good swing on it.”</p>\n<p>The tie did not last long as UCLA manufactured a run in the next inning against sophomore pitcher Domenic Mazza, who came in relief for Vasquez. Mazza allowed a runner to reach first base, resulting in a successful steal of second after. The Bruins capitalized with another single to take the lead once more.</p>\n<p>Now trailing, Santa Barbara remained persistent on offense and managed to tie the game once more. With consecutive hits to put runners on first and second base, junior shortstop Peter Maris advanced to within 90 feet from the plate on a fly-out. In need of a clutch hit, freshman center fielder Andrew Calica delivered with an RBI up the middle to complete the 5-5 comeback.</p>\n<p>“We got some toughness,” Checketts said. “We’ve been down because the starting pitching hasn’t been very good this year. So we’ve been chasing runs quite a bit and have had a lot of situations like that. The guys definitely did a good job of coming back.”</p>\n<p>With 10 runs combined through the first five innings, the game from there on turned into a battle between the bullpens. After Mazza pitched an efficient 4.1 innings, allowing only one earned run, Checketts handed the ball over to junior Greg Mahle. Mahle retired the first three batters faced in the seventh inning and had a quick eighth inning to end his appearance.</p>\n<p>Despite not scoring for the rest of the game, the Gauchos did have opportunities to break the deadlock. UCSB put runners on the corners in the sixth inning for senior left fielder Joey Epperson, the team’s leading hitter. However, Epperson came up empty as he popped up to the shortstop to end the inning. In the following inning, the Gauchos failed to bring in Kuresa from third base after junior outfielder Scott Quinlan struck out looking with two outs.</p>\n<p>UCSB used just four pitchers for the entire game, including using sophomore closer Dillon Tate for the final four innings. Tate was on point in his appearance, striking out four batters on only 56 pitches. His combination of fastball and sinker kept UCLA from scoring.</p>\n<p>“I give all the credit in the world to Dillon,” Kuresa said. “He pitched a good game and they couldn’t do anything against him, too.”</p>\n<p>After 12 innings of play and with night starting to become a factor, the umpires called the game as a 5-5 draw.</p>\n<p>UCSB now prepares for its biggest series of the season against first-place in the Big West UC Irvine beginning this Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 30, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55085\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55085\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/gauchos-and-bruins-tie-in-12-innings/","id":4717,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4716,4715,4714],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dillon Tate Q and A: Food, Music and Baseball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball17PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball17PeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=853%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Staff writer Mark Salay sat down with Gaucho pitcher Dillon Tate for a fun Q and A session.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a fastball clocking in at over 95 mph and a nasty slider that makes some batters look like little leaguers, sophomore pitcher Dillon Tate has established himself this season as one of the best closers in the nation.

But I’d say the calendars we have set up on the computer help me a lot to get organized and just being really cautious of my time and trying to manage. That is what helps me.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: So what are some of the things you like to do to relax?</p>\n<p>A: I enjoy going to the beach in my spare time. I don’t really get much spare time, but on my off days I like to go down to the beach after class with all my teammates, and we’ll play catch on the beach, which is pretty nice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: When you want that cheap meal, what’s your favorite place in I.V. to hit up?</p>\n<p>A: There’s a number of different places in I.V. that I can go to for some cheap meals. The Habit is a pretty good place to go for a cheap meal or Kaptain’s Barbeque is a place I enjoy going to. And if I’m not in I.V. or one of those places, I will probably go to In-N-Out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Before every game what music do you play to get you pumped up?</p>\n<p>A: That’s a good question. I always try to listen to some of the same songs on my phone when I’m in the clubhouse before the game. Just rap, I would say. I listen to Rick Ross before a game. That’s something I’ve done continuously before every game — just that same [Rick Ross] song right before I go out on the field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Which song is it?</p>\n<p>A: It’s called “9 Piece.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: You’ve been playing baseball for such a long time. Do you ever get tired of the sport?</p>\n<p>A: I would say no. The only thing I would get tired with sometimes is practice because it’s kind of the same old routine in that it gets tedious, but I’m not really tired of it. The only reason I would probably get tired of the sport I feel like is when I’m out in the field and I don’t have anything to eat, and I get hungry. Because then I get kind of cranky.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Do you ever take some of that crankiness out on your teammates? Can they tell?</p>\n<p>A: Maybe some of them can, like some of the other pitchers because we have the same rotation together sometimes. So when we share these rotations together I feel like some of them might see that like, “Oh, Dillon is getting pretty cranky” or “Dillon must be hungry.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Which baseball team do you root for?</p>\n<p>A: I really like the Red Sox, not because they won the World Series this past year, but I’ve been a fan of them since 2003 when they lost in the ALCS to the Yankees. That’s kind of odd how a loss in the playoffs was something that attracted to me to another team. But it wasn’t so much a loss, but just the way they played, that I was attracted to.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: So I’m guessing you really hate Aaron Boone then?</p>\n<p>A: Not a fan.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What about Derek Jeter? Are you sad he’s retiring?</p>\n<p>A: Not really sad, but even though he’s on the Yankees and everything, that’s someone that I feel everyone in baseball looks up to … I feel like people in Boston don’t loathe him or anything, but they respect him for what he’s done and how he’s been in the game so long.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Any animosity toward Jacoby Ellsbury?</p>\n<p>A: Ahhh! That’s just a tough situation. He was a really big part of [the Red Sox] and it really sucks to lose someone like that, but I mean you got to think the individual player has to do what’s best for them. I think that’s what he did; he just did something that was best for him and so he went to the Yankees. It sucks to see him go, but you got to respect it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What about you personally? Any game that you had a big role in that stands out to you?</p>\n<p>A: There haven’t been any games that stand out to me personally, but I’d say close games we win are highlights for me. Any game we win where I’m pitching or not pitching is always good.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s been your most embarrassing moment on the field while playing for UCSB?</p>\n<p>A: I don’t really have one. I really haven’t [had] one that embarrassing yet, so I will keep my fingers crossed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Did anything embarrassing in high school happen to you?</p>\n<p>A: Oh high school, definitely. I was at third base once, and this guy hit a swinging bunt. We were playing our rival school and I went up to get the swinging bunt, and I missed it under my glove. And I tried to turn around really fast to go get it, and my foot just came out from under me, and I just fell on my back. That was pretty bad — people were laughing at me and everything.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s one thing you can’t live without?</p>\n<p>A: Probably my music is one thing I couldn’t live without. That’s something I need every day; I wake up, and I play my music and I ride my bike to class.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Baseball players are pretty famous for having these insane pregame rituals. Do you have one?</p>\n<p>A: I wouldn’t even call it a ritual; I would call it more of a routine. As far as my routine goes, I come to the field with my headphones on and after we’re done taking batting practice — well, I got to back up a little bit — I stretch the same person out every day, even in practice. After we’re done with batting practice I go into the clubhouse, I eat my sandwich and I always listen to music, and I listen to that same song right before I take the field. So that would be something that’s part of my routine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: So you bump that same Rick Ross song every single time?</p>\n<p>A: Yeah. I might listen to a couple different songs before, while I’m relaxing watching TV, but it’s primarily music that gets me game ready and focused. And I always end the playlist with that Rick Ross song.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: I have to check that song out. His last album was pretty good.</p>\n<p>A: Yeah, I enjoyed it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Yeah, “Sanctified” is my favorite song on the album.</p>\n<p>A: I’d say the second song is my favorite on the album.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Is that “The Devil is a Lie” with Jay-Z ?</p>\n<p>A: No, it’s “Rich is Gangsta.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: What’s one team you hate losing to the most?</p>\n<p>A: I wouldn’t say there’s one team in particular I hate losing to, but it’d probably be just any team we lose to. I don’t like it. Especially home losses. Home losses are one thing I really can’t stand because I just don’t like it when another team takes the mound after you lose, and they walk on your mound … I feel we should beat everyone we play because I think the guys on the team are that good.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Q: Now finish this sentence for me.

UCSB was down 4-0 as early as the first inning as freshman pitcher Shane Bieber struggled settling in. The Gaucho offense was kept in check by the Highlanders’ senior relief pitcher Dylan Stuart. Stuart entered the game in the fourth inning and had command of his four pitches to keep hitters guessing throughout his 5.2 innings of work.</p>\n<p>“They came out and scored four in the first; that’s usually tough to rebound from,” Woodward said. “Those are big momentum swings. We added on and responded and scored in the same inning — in the first — but it’s tough when you have a deficit like that early on. I think some things didn’t go our way (yesterday).”</p>\n<p>UCSB mounted a come-from-behind 6-5 win on Saturday after erasing a two-run deficit. Down 5-3 in the sixth inning, the Gauchos got the ball rolling on a double that brought junior outfielder Cameron Newell home from first base.</p>\n<p>After the Highlanders went down quietly in the top of the seventh inning, Santa Barbara began the bottom half with consecutive singles to put runners on first and second base. UCSB was quick to capitalize on the situation when UCR committed a throwing error on a sacrifice bunt that brought in the runner from second. With one out and the scored tied, Newell gave UCSB the lead with an RBI groundout before the inning ended.</p>\n<p>Now with a one-run lead, Head Coach Andrew Checketts elected to bring in his shutdown closer, sophomore Dillon Tate, for the two-inning save. The right-hander had his usual stuff working and converted his tenth save of the season, with five of the six outs recorded coming by way of strikeout.</p>\n<p>“We rely on Dillon to do that when he comes in the game,” junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa said. “We think he’s going to get it done. It wasn’t a surprise to any of us how he performed.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was in full control in the series’ opening game on Friday, coming out with a 6-2 win behind the stellar pitching of sophomore Justin Jacome. Jacome tossed 6.1 innings of three-hit ball and gave up only two runs on the day to improve his record to 5-1 on the season.</p>\n<p>“He did a good job throwing strikes and pounding the strike zone,” Checketts said. “He struggled a little bit with his command early and was able to find it; he did a good job.”</p>\n<p>Junior shortstop Peter Maris led the way offensively for Santa Barbara with a three-hit performance. Maris tripled in the first inning to bring in a runner from first base and then came home on a sacrifice fly to give UCSB a 2-0 lead. Maris once again came to bat with a runner on second in the sixth inning and singled to left field to tack on another run for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCR got back to into the game with a two-run seventh inning, however, Santa Barbara countered with a three-run effort in the bottom half to push its lead to 6-2 and put away the Highlanders.</p>\n<p>UCSB will next play UCLA at home on Tuesday at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of April 28, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55055\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55055\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-28/gauchos-capture-series-victory-over-uc-riverside/","id":4715,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4714,4713,4712],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 19 Gauchos Enter Must-Win Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Baseball_Brock1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces UC Riverside in second to last home series.

We have to take it one game at a time and get better every day.”</p>\n<p>UCR has been the conference’s biggest overachievers so far. Climbing their way to almost .500, the Highlanders are 17-19 overall and 6-3 in league after sweeping UC Davis in their last conference series. Riverside sits alone in third place, two games out of the second spot.</p>\n<p>With just two conference road wins under its belt, Santa Barbara welcomes a return to Caesar Uyesaka Stadium where it is 15-4 this year. Meanwhile, the road has been a headache for UCR. Riverside is 4-12 outside of home and has lost eight of its last nine away games. UCSB will have to take advantage of the home field given this is the second to last conference home series on the year.</p>\n<p>Senior Jake Smigelski will take the mound in game one for the Highlanders. In his last start against UC Davis, Smigelski threw 100 pitches in five laboring innings of work to improve to 5-4 on the season. For UCSB, sophomore Justin Jacome will be called on to contain the UCR offense that ranks third in hitting.</p>\n<p>Junior Austin Pettibone is slated to take the mound for the Gauchos in game two, followed by freshman Shane Bieber in game three. Bieber is coming off his best start of the season last weekend when he tossed eight innings and gave up just one run en route to striking out eight batters.</p>\n<p>After leading the nation in hitting last week, senior third baseman Joey Epperson now finds himself in an unexpected hitting slump. Epperson has gone 1-12 in the past three games to lower his batting average to .418, a drop from his previous clip of .441. Nevertheless, the senior still leads the Big West in batting average and on-base percentage.</p>\n<p>Epperson and junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa have provided the one-two punch on offense for the Gauchos. Kuresa leads the team with 33 RBIs, and his .574 slugging percentage and eight homeruns are second-best in league.

Bieber tossed eight innings of four-hit ball and struck out eight batters to limit the Dirtbags to just one run.</p>\n<p>“That was the best I’ve ever seen [Bieber],” junior pitcher Austin Pettibone said. “He was kind of in the zone with his fastball. His slider was pretty filthy. That’s all you want to do — to be able to get deep into the game.”</p>\n<p>His outing set the stage for sophomore pitcher Dillon Tate to collect his ninth save of the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB broke the game’s deadlock on a RBI groundout by sophomore utility player Robby Nesovic in the third inning to go up 1-0. Santa Barbara manufactured another run in the following inning on a fly out, after a sacrifice bunt advanced a runner to third base.</p>\n<p>Much of the game from there on consisted of each team’s pitching retiring the others’ bats. Bieber’s lone blemish came in the fifth inning when he allowed a runner to score on a fielder’s choice.</p>\n<p>Bieber was near perfect on the day, needing only 93 pitches for the win and lowering his ERA to 2.89.</p>\n<p>Bieber’s outing came the day before when Long Beach’s senior pitcher Josh Frye shutout the Gauchos in a tight 1-0 decision. Frye canceled out Pettibone’s own impressive efforts. The two starters were locked in a pitcher’s duel with Pettibone exiting after six innings with one run allowed.</p>\n<p>After Long Beach capitalized on two hits in the first inning to score the game’s only run, Pettibone seemed in for a long outing similar to his last start, but the right-hander settled down from there on.</p>\n<p>“It felt good to throw well again; I’ve been struggling these past couple weeks against Cal Poly and Fullerton,” Pettibone said. “I gave up an earned run which ended up hurting us, but overall I had a competitive outing.”</p>\n<p>Frye went the distance to improve to 3-0 on the season. Long Beach has now won Frye’s last four starts as the senior has given up only one run in his last 27 innings thrown.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s only threat came by way of junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa, who was the only Gaucho to get past first base.</p>\n<p>Thursday’s five-run game was the highest scoring game of the series. Mounting a two-run rally in the ninth, the Gauchos’ comeback attempt fell short in the bottom half of the inning on a walk-off hit by the Dirtbags.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s sophomore pitcher Andrew Rohrbach kept hitters guessing for eight innings and did not rattle until the ninth. Kuresa doubled to force a change, and junior Kyle Friedrichs came in for the save.</p>\n<p>Friedrichs, however, gave up a walk and was victim to an infield error that brought in the runner from second. Freshman DH Billy Fredrick then stepped up to the plate and delivered the game-tying hit to nod the score at 2-2 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Long Beach got the bottom half of the inning started with a single off junior Greg Mahle. Mahle, who has been a workhorse and reliable relief pitcher for the Gauchos, retired the next batter before giving up the game-winning double for the 3-2 loss.</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts UCR beginning Friday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of </em><em>April 21, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54922\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54922\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-20/gauchos-drop-series-to-long-beach-state/","id":4713,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4712,4711,4710],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 14 UCSB Hits the Road to Face Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_1548_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_1548_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB will look to continue its strong play against Long Beach State after winning last week's series against Fullerton.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Coming off three wins in its past four games, the No. 14 UCSB baseball team eyes its first conference series win on the road starting tonight against Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game 23-8 overall and 4-5 in the Big West after Monday’s nonconference victory against BYU.

Hopefully the way we’ve been playing continues to reward us this weekend at Long Beach.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach State presents a different challenge for Santa Barbara. The Dirtbags have won three of their last seven series and enter 16-18 overall and 3-3 in league.</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s winning formula has been pitching and defense. Senior pitcher Josh Frye has been the ace of the staff and pitches the second game of the series. The right-hander has started the last three weeks and the team has gone 3-0 in each of his appearances. Frye has been nearly unhittable, allowing just a run in his last 16 innings and five hits combined during his last two starts.</p>\n<p>Just as unhittable has been junior closer Kyle Friedrichs. In six save opportunities, the closer has converted all of them without giving up a run or walk, with just two hits. Opposing batters are hitting a mere .105 against him.</p>\n<p>LBSU’s efficiency on defense is shown in its .980 fielding percentage, the eighth highest in the country. In total, the Dirtbags have committed just 27 errors this season.</p>\n<p>Although not as reputable as Cal State Fullerton, UCSB learned how tough the Big West is earlier in the season when it lost its series against Hawaii University and will be careful not to repeat its mistake.</p>\n<p>“When you have a good year, you have a target on your back,” Epperson said. “I wouldn’t expect Long Beach to be any different. We’re preparing just like we prepared for Fullerton.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have consistently been able to put up runs on the scoreboard. Statistically, Santa Barbara is top in the league in batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and homeruns.</p>\n<p>While UCSB’s offensive statistics are a testament to the team’s potent lineup, no hitter in the country this year has been seeing the ball as clear as Epperson.</p>\n<p>Epperson leads the nation with a .451 batting average and his numbers have been recognized with him being added to the Midseason “Golden Spikes Award” Watch List — the award given to the top amateur player in the country. His most underrated aspect, however, has been his versatility to hit anywhere in the batting order, from leadoff to the cleanup spot.</p>\n<p>“There’s really not a lot of pressure on each individual offensively, and I certainly feel that way,” Epperson said. “I’m really comfortable on the leadoff spot and I’ll hit wherever, and I kind of feel like I’m just going to go for it and do whatever I can to help the team win.”</p>\n<p>Just as dominant as Epperson, has been the UCSB bullpen. When leading after six innings, Santa Barbara is 17-0 with much of the credit going to sophomore closer Dillon Tate and his eight saves on the season, second overall in conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will send sophomore Justin Jacome and junior Austin Pettibone for games one and two, respectively. Saturday’s starter is yet to be announced.</p>\n<p>First pitch tonight is set for 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 17, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54887\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54887\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-16/no-14-ucsb-hits-the-road-to-face-long-beach-state/","id":4711,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4710,4709,4708],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 13 UCSB Takes Series Against Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BaseballPeterVandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The No. 13 Gauchos won the series against the No. 19 Titans 2-1.

Both kept batters off balance by throwing breaking pitches, with Mazza’s curveball helping him get through 5.2 innings of relief and not allowing a run. The left-hander improved to 3-2 on the season after coming in for freshman starter Shane Bieber.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to pick up my teammate, Bieber. He struggled a little bit, but he kept them to only two runs,” Mazza said. “I just wanted to come in and keep them where they were at, basically limit the inning and pound the zone.”</p>\n<p>With a new pitcher for Fullerton on the mound in the ninth, junior outfielder Cameron Newell singled up the middle on the first pitch of the inning to put a runner on first base. After a sacrifice bunt advanced the runner, the nation’s leading hitter, Epperson, connected on a fastball for his second walk-off hit against a ranked opponent in his career.</p>\n<p>“I thought they were just going to put me on, but when they didn’t, I figured they were pitching around me,” Epperson said. “I was trusting that Newell’s got good legs out there, and I was just trying to put a good swing on a ball, and not do too much.”</p>\n<p>Game one foreshadowed the closeness of the two teams. What was thought to be a low-scoring game turned out to be anything but as each team knocked around each side’s best pitcher early on.</p>\n<p>The Titans’ pitcher Thomas Eshelman came in with a 1.43 ERA and 5-1 record, but the Gauchos roughed him up for six earned runs, the most given up in his career. UCSB’s ace, junior Austin Pettibone did not fare better, lasting just three innings before exiting.</p>\n<p>The game was tied 9-9 in the tenth before darkness forced the match to be rescheduled before the start of game two. CSUF came out on top when play resumed by sneaking in two runs in the 11th inning for the hard fought 11-9 win.</p>\n<p>“You end in a tie to be resumed the next day and there’s a little bit of a letdown,” Epperson said. “Unfortunately they put a couple good swings together in that first half and we went down 2-0 right away. It was tough because I thought the day before I kind of felt if we grinded that out, it would’ve gone our way.”</p>\n<p>UCSB takes a break from conference play for today’s match against BYU. The Cougars are 14-23 overall on the season and 5-10 in the West Coast Conference after losing two games in its series against Pepperdine University.</p>\n<p>Brigham Young will rely on its three best hitters in junior third baseman Dillon Robinson, senior infielder Brock Whitney and freshman outfielder Brennon Lund. Each is hitting above .300 and will cause problems for UCSB pitching.</p>\n<p>First pitch is scheduled for 1 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of April 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54823\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54823\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-14/no-13-ucsb-takes-series-against-fullerton/","id":4712,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4711,4710,4709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"No. 13 UCSB Hosts No. 19 Fullerton in Battle of Conference Contenders","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Baseball","publish_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3.4.2014.UCSB_.Baseball.v.Waseda-1_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/3.4.2014.UCSB_.Baseball.v.Waseda-1_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces a big test this weekend with a three-game series against perennial powerhouse Cal State Fullerton.

UCSB has lost just three times in 15 games at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium while the Titans have been inconsistent on the road with a 5-6 record.</p>\n<p>Fullerton will have to zone in on certain batters to contain UCSB. In his senior year for the Gauchos, infielder/outfielder Joey Epperson has been leading the way. Epperson is hitting a Big West high .462 clip to go along with a .615 slugging percentage. Junior first baseman Tyler Kuresa has eight dingers and junior infielder Peter Maris has 14 stolen bases, each a conference best.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara, as a whole, has been extremely productive on offense despite it not translating to wins; the team leads the Big West in many statistical categories. UCSB has the fewest strikeouts, highest slugging percentage, batting average, home runs and stolen bases.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of different ways we can threaten you,” Checketts said. “We’ve shown more power this year which is nice, we’ve got some execution guys that can hit-and-run, and then we have pretty much most of the lineup that can run.”</p>\n<p>In its last series, the bullpen for UCSB came up huge when its starting pitching failed to get deep into games. In 4.1 innings of combined work, junior Greg Mahle kept UCSB in contention in two appearances in the series and came away with a win in the opening game to improve to 5-1 on the season.</p>\n<p>UCSB will send out junior pitcher Austin Pettibone to start game one and freshman Shane Bieber on Saturday, while Sunday’s starter is yet to be announced. The Gauchos will need more innings out of its starters after its relief pitchers were heavily used last weekend.</p>\n<p>“The longer starters go, the less wear and tear the bullpen will have,” junior pitcher Andrew Vasquez said. “The bullpen is huge; it keeps us in games. The starters give us a chance to win, and the bullpen makes sure we still have a chance to win.”</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton may not have the same offensive numbers as the Gauchos but their games have resulted in wins, in part to its dominant pitching. CSUF has the lowest ERA in the conference at 2.05 and has the second highest rate of strikeouts per game at 8.33.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big series but every conference series is a big series,” Vasquez said. “We’ll treat it the same way we treat every other series.”</p>\n<p>First pitch for Friday’s game is at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of April 10, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54759\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/no-14-ucsb-hosts-no-19-fullerton-in-battle-of-conference-contenders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54759\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/no-14-ucsb-hosts-no-19-fullerton-in-battle-of-conference-contenders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/no-14-ucsb-hosts-no-19-fullerton-in-battle-of-conference-contenders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/no-14-ucsb-hosts-no-19-fullerton-in-battle-of-conference-contenders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/no-14-ucsb-hosts-no-19-fullerton-in-battle-of-conference-contenders/","id":4696,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[4695,4694,4693],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":4,"highestPage":11,"route":"/authors/65"}},"__N_SSG":true}
