Despite salvaging a split and defeating Cal State Fullerton 4-2 on Friday, yesterday’s 1-0 loss against UC Riverside mathematically eliminated the Gauchos from the postseason.</p>\n<p>“Friday night was great; the Sunday game stings a little bit because I think we’re better than [UC Riverside],” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “In addition to that, it would’ve moved us up two or three spots in conference; we would’ve kept the outside chance of getting into the Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara moves to 5-11-2 overall and 2-5-1 in conference play. With only seven points earned and one game left in the year, the Gauchos will be left on the outside looking in as only the top four teams in the league will compete for the Big West title.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After an impressive offensive output against Fullerton, the Gauchos struggled finding the back of the net Sunday against Riverside. UCR took an early lead, scoring in the third minute on junior midfielder Andrea Morales’ shot from a set piece.</p>\n<p>The goal seemed to settle down the Gauchos, who then took control of the game for the entire duration of the match, even forcing a penalty kick, which was blocked by the Highlander goalkeeper. Despite outplaying UCR in every aspect, the Gauchos could not finish their opportunities.</p>\n<p>“We took more shots, we took more corner kicks, we even earned ourselves a penalty kick, but we just did not finish our chances,” Stumpf said. “I think the girls are a little disappointed in themselves because I think we let one slip away.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s game, the Gauchos faced a Fullerton team that had only allowed four total goals in conference entering the match. However, UCSB capitalized on its only three shots in the first half, scoring the trio of goals in a 15 minute span.</p>\n<p>Sophomore midfielder/forward Indiana Mead opened the scoring for the Gauchos in the 15th minute, followed by freshman midfielder/forward Angelisa Cortez’s third goal of the season a minute later. After the Titans cut the lead in half, senior midfielder Erin Ortega scored to send the Gauchos into halftime with a 3-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>Cal State Fullerton came out of halftime pressuring the UCSB backline, outshooting the Gauchos 12-6 in the second half, but junior goalkeeper Makenna Henry was the defensive stopper of the game, coming up big with nine saves on the night. Freshman forward/midfielder Mayra Almazan sealed UCSB’s first road conference win of the season with her first collegiate goal in the 70th minute.</p>\n<p>“The shooting Friday night was significantly better and interestingly enough we played a better team on Friday and we snuck four [goals] in,” Stumpf said. “Friday night was a great performance for our team. Once again they played hard; the possession was really nice.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s four goals were the most allowed this season by the Titans, who came in as one of the top-ranked defenses in the Big West. These four goals were also the most scored this season by the Gauchos, who came in struggling and won only their second game in the last nine matches.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now prepare itself for the Blue-Green rivalry game against Cal Poly this Sunday at San Luis Obispo in its final match of the season.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-22/gauchos-erupt-beat-csuf/","id":1641,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1640,1639,1638],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels South to Face Riverside, Fullerton","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After playing its final home games of the regular season, the UCSB women’s soccer team travels south for a pair of conference matches against Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside this weekend.

we just have to put the ball in the back of the net.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton (7-7 overall, 4-1 conference) enters as one of the hottest teams in the Big West, winning its last four games and propelling to fourth place in conference after defeating Riverside 1-0 last week. Despite scoring only one goal in five of its six conference games, the</p>\n<p>Titan defense has been the cornerstone of the team’s success, shutting out six of its opponents this season and allowing a league-low four goals in conference play.</p>\n<p>Considering the Titans are second in conference in goals against average (0.77), it will be critical for Santa Barbara to take advantage of its offensive opportunities.</p>\n<p>“We play with three strikers and one center mid, so we’re going to do everything we can to aim pressure on their [defense] and get turnovers closer to goal when we’re attacking,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We’re going to do everything we can to create as many scoring opportunities as we can.”</p>\n<p>After playing Fullerton on Friday, UCSB will travel to the Inland Empire for Sunday’s match against a Highlander team that is last in the Big West with a 5-9-2 overall record and 0-5 conference record.</p>\n<p>Although playing in front of a home crowd, a win will be hard to come by for Riverside who has lost six straight to the Gauchos and is 2-10 all-time against UCSB.</p>\n<p>“No matter what happens on Friday, we’ve got to gather ourselves; reset the tactics a little bit because they play a slightly different system,” Stumpf said. “We’re just going to put the healthiest group out there and have them go after them and hopefully get an early goal so we can grab a little bit of momentum.”</p>\n<p>With UCSB’s defense ranking near the bottom of the conference with a 1.74 goals against average, the Gauchos will try to take advantage of a struggling UCR offense that has been outscored in conference 13-3 and is last in shots taken (31) and goals per game (0.60).</p>\n<p>Kickoff is set for Friday at 7 p.m. against Fullerton and at 1 p.m. Sunday versus Riverside.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Meanwhile, the Hornets fall to 7-5-2 overall and 4-1-1 in conference. The Gauchos now have 10 points in league, sitting in third place along with Cal Poly. Sac State sits atop the crowded Big West North with 13 points.</p>\n<p>Offense came in a hurry for the Gauchos, as Boateng rocketed a shot from 30 yards out into the top corner of the net in the seventh minute to give UCSB its first goal of the match.</p>\n<p>Less than a minute later, senior midfielder Nic Ryan scored his team-leading seventh goal of the season, capitalizing on a hard shot that was not handled by the Hornet goalkeeper. Ryan easily capitalized on the failed clearance from inside the box for a 2-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>“Ema got the ball off a throw in and kind of cut in and banged one with his left foot,” Ryan said. “We pressed again, we got the ball, [senior defender Peter] McGlynn got it out wide, just crossed it and it came right to me, it was kind of a lucky thing.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara controlled every aspect of the first half, putting pressure on the Hornet defense and dominating the offensive flow of the game. Sacramento State was only able to get off one shot in the half, getting outshot by the Gauchos by a 12-1 margin.</p>\n<p>UCSB went back to work in the second half, controlling the ball and frustrating the Sacramento State offense. Santa Barbara managed to create plenty more scoring chances, putting up 12 shots while limiting the Hornets to six, but came up empty and settled for the 2-0 victory.</p>\n<p>“I actually thought we played a very good first half,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I really felt we defended well. I thought we controlled the game, we were on the ball most of the night and I thought we had good energy.”</p>\n<p>Up next for the Gauchos will be the Blue-Green rivalry game against conference opponent Cal Poly. More will be at stake on this rivalry matchup as each team is tied for third place with just five games left to play in the season.</p>\n<p>“Friday’s game is crucial and every game from now on is definitely big,” Ryan said. “We know we have to win all of them and we’re confident we can do that.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48245\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/early-goals-push-ucsb-sac-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48245\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/early-goals-push-ucsb-sac-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/early-goals-push-ucsb-sac-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/early-goals-push-ucsb-sac-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-17/early-goals-push-ucsb-sac-state/","id":1637,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1636,1635,1634],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Home Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its final home games of the regular season, the UCSB women’s soccer team defeated the University of Hawaii 1-0 before losing a close contest to Cal State Northridge by a 1-0 margin.

Despite snapping a six-game winless streak with Friday’s win over Hawaii, the Gauchos were not as fortunate in Sunday’s loss to CSUN in the final match at Harder Stadium for seniors Erin Ortega, Dyanne Anderson and Lauren Kennedy.</p>\n<p>The first half against the Matadors was a defensive stalemate, with each side putting pressure on the ball and the offense generating few chances on goal. With the match still even heading into the last 10 minutes of regulation, the game seemed to be heading into overtime until CSUN’s freshman midfielder Taylor Hobson was able to exploit the backline and score from 10 yards out, giving Cal State Northridge the 1-0 victory.</p>\n<p>“It was very even — a lot of heart and passion.

I think it will be really emotional because I think it is just going to absolutely hit me; it hasn’t hit yet that season is coming to an end and soccer is ending.”</p>\n<p>Despite having an offensive resurgence and scoring at least one goal in five consecutive games, defensive mishaps have been the Gauchos’ main fault. In its last six games, the backline has been exploited for 15 goals. Hawaii (6-6-2 overall, 1-2 Big West) is coming off a split of two conference matches, a 2-0 victory over UC Riverside and a 1-0 loss to Cal State Fullerton in double overtime that snapped its 12 game home-winning streak. UCSB will try to take advantage of a tired Hawaii team that will have to fly to Los Angeles and then drive to Santa Barbara. In its last 19 road matches, the Rainbow Wahine have struggled, going 2-17 and is 1-5 on the road this season.</p>\n<p>Condering the Rainbow Wahine rank third in the Big West in goals per game at 1.57, tiring Hawaii out could serve as a huge advantage.</p>\n<p>“The fact we have them here at home really kind of helps us,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “They have to take a trip to the airport in Hawaii, they have to take a five hour flight and they have to drive two and half hours to get here from LAX. [We have to] try and take the game to them because they’re going to be tired with all the traveling.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will then host the Matadors (5-4-4 overall, 2-1 Big West) on Sunday, who have played impressive soccer in their conference so far. The Matadors easily defeated UCR 3-1 in its last game and lost 1-0 in overtime to CSUF last Friday. However, CSUN will have to travel to Santa Barbara after playing a tough Cal Poly team on Friday.</p>\n<p>“They’re having a great year … they have a couple great results; they’re coming here with two conference wins,” Stumpf said. “Luckily they have to play at Cal Poly on Friday so hopefully they have a hard time up there and come to us a little tired.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s offense will really need to kick into gear if the Gauchos want to give its seniors a win in its last game at Harder Stadium. The Matadors lead the league in goals against average at .64.</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Friday’s match against Hawaii is set for 7 p.m. and at 1 p.m. Sunday versus CSUN.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/gauchos-play-final-home-matches-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/gauchos-play-final-home-matches-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/gauchos-play-final-home-matches-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/gauchos-play-final-home-matches-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-12/gauchos-play-final-home-matches-year/","id":1630,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1629,1628,1627],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gankema Twins: UCSB’s Double Trouble","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Entering the season as one of the youngest teams in the Big West, the UCSB women’s soccer team has matured into a serious contender this year thanks in large part to the veteran play of two junior G...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Entering the season as one of the youngest teams in the Big West, the UCSB women’s soccer team has matured into a serious contender this year thanks in large part to the veteran play of two junior Gauchos in the backline.

They showed off their footwork at UCSB’s summer soccer camp and impressed the coaching staff with their intelligence and skill.</p>\n<p>“We saw them play a few times, then they came to our summer camp and it was at that camp that they convinced us that we needed to go after them,” Stumpf said. “They’re really intelligent soccer players, very skilled soccer players. They’re not the most imposing players on the face of the planet, but they maximize what they do have.”</p>\n<p>Despite winning various championships at the club level together and each winning various awards and accolades, success was not always the case for the Gankema sisters. Each struggled with assimilating to their individual roles early in their collegiate careers. In the first two seasons, both players combined for a total of only one start.</p>\n<p>“Before we became freshmen, we played every single minute of every single game. We were starters, we were the best in the team,” Paige said. “But once you come here, you’re trying to compete with other girls that are the best on the team. So it’s just hard to be a full-time player and being a superstar in the club team, and then coming in and not being able to play and not starting.”</p>\n<p>Things were especially difficult for Lindsay, who despite playing in 12 games last season, had to see Paige on the sideline for most of the season as she played in only one game in 2011.</p>\n<p>“It was difficult because our whole lives, we always played exactly at the same time, we played the whole game,” Lindsay said. “It was different to see [Paige] out when I played, and I felt bad, but coaches, in the end, decide.”</p>\n<p>Patience and persistence paid off for both sisters as their hard work in practice was finally recognized at the start of this season and has led to an increase in playing time for the two Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I think they’ve started or played in almost every game, so it’s great for them; they put in their time on the bench doing almost everything right,” Stumpf said. “Now their opportunity arises and I think they’re grabbing that opportunity with two hands and holding on. They are mentally tough and physically tough, so I’m really kind of proud of kids like that.”</p>\n<p>Now, having the opportunity to play on the field at the same time once again, the two players have helped the defense with their established chemistry and sixth sense of knowing where the other sister is on the field at all times.</p>\n<p>“We just work well together, we kind of know exactly how each other plays, what to expect from each other, where I’m going to go, where she’s going to go,” Paige said. “We can kind of tell beforehand what’s going to happen — if she’s going to win the ball, that kind of thing. It’s fun getting to play with your sister, there’s nothing better than that.”</p>\n<p>Despite being born only 17 minutes apart — Lindsay being the oldest — you will be hard-pressed to find any sibling rivalry existing between the two defenders, as they are each other’s biggest supporters on and off the field.</p>\n<p>“We’re always there for each other, so I would say [our relationship] is the same off and on the field,” Lindsay said. “We’re best friends. I consider her more my friend than my sister because we’re always together and we’re always hanging out; we do everything together.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48050\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48050\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-10/gankema-twins-ucsbs-double-trouble/","id":1633,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1632,1631,1630],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lose Two on Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its first conference road trip of the season, the UCSB women’s soccer team came up empty in its two games against Long Beach State and UC Irvine this past weekend.

Despite leading Long Beach and UCI at one point in each game, it was a tale of two halves for the Gauchos as they faltered in the second half of each match.</p>\n<p>The two losses this past weekend drop the Gauchos’ record to 3-9-2 overall and 0-3-1 in conference. Already four games into conference, the Gauchos’ chances at making a playoff run are in trouble, as they are still without a conference win and have only won one game in their past seven matches.</p>\n<p>UCSB travelled to Anteater Stadium on Sunday, where they have been winless since 2005, but got off to a strong start on Sunday as freshman midfielder/forward Angelisa Cortez’s goal put the Gauchos ahead five minutes into the match. It was Cortez’s second goal of the season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The lead was short-lived, though, as Santa Barbara gave up a goal in the 24th minute to go 1-1 at the half and then allowed a goal one minute into the second half. UCSB was not able to respond to the Anteater attack and gave up a foul inside the box in the 82nd minute. Senior forward Rachel Wood stepped up for UCI to convert the penalty kick and seal a 3-1 loss for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I thought the first half we did extremely well and as soon as they scored, our heads kind dropped,” senior midfielder Dyanne Anderson said. “We had our chances, but they just didn’t go in.”</p>\n<p>In an evenly-contested first half against Long Beach on Friday night, the Gauchos went up 1-0 in the 22nd minute as freshman midfielder Sara Feder found the back of the net when Cortez crossed the ball to the left side.

In the 60th minute, junior midfielder Eileen Maes received a pass from sophomore defender Renee Mendiola and shot it from just outside the box and into the right side of the goal to even the game at one apiece. Just two minutes later, the Gaucho defense let up again and a crucial foul proved to be costly, as Mendiola lost her defender and scored a header on a free kick to give Long Beach a 2-1 win. The 49ers dominated the second half, outshooting UCSB 13-2 in the half.</p>\n<p>“The girls played beautifully in the first half … I don’t know what happened in the second half,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “The goals we gave up were mistakes, [which is] really tough.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48009\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48009\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/gauchos-lose-road/","id":1631,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1630,1629,1628],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Looks for First Conference Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With a loss and a draw in its first two Big West conference games this past weekend, the UCSB women’s soccer team now goes on the road for its first road trip of conference play.

The Gauchos will have no easy task as they look to build upon last weekend’s performance against preseason conference favorite Long Beach State and second in conference UC Irvine.</p>\n<p>“This weekend will probably be our toughest weekend of the season,” senior midfielder/defender Erin Ortega said. “Long Beach [was] a top 25 team and we’ve always struggled playing at UC Irvine. I think it’ll be a good challenge for the team especially since we’re still young … It’ll be a good challenge and we’re excited.”</p>\n<p>UCSB (3-7-2 overall, 0-1-1 Big West) is coming off two overtime games that resulted in mixed results. In last Friday’s conference home opener against UC Davis, the Gauchos gave up a goal in sudden death overtime after tying the match with five minutes left in regulation. Santa Barbara responded last Sunday against the University of the Pacific and managed a 3-3 tie in double overtime after falling behind by two goals.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The 49ers, which hold a 8-4-0 overall record an a 1-1-0 Big West record, will host the Gauchos tonight and look to rebound after its stunning 2-1 defeat against Cal State Fullerton last Sunday. Long Beach entered the contest as the only nationally-ranked team in the Big West with a ranking of No. 24, but dropped out of the national rankings for the first time this season after allowing a goal to Fullerton in the 88th minute. Senior forward Nadia Link will head the 49er offense; the 2011 Big West Offensive Player of the Year leads the team with five goals scored including one against UC Riverside in last Friday’s 5-1 victory. UCSB will also have to account for LBSU’s balanced attack as six different players scored in last weekend’s games and 13 players have scored 22 goals in total for the 49ers.</p>\n<p>“We really need to clean up [defensively] in the future because I think better teams will take advantage of some of those mistakes we made,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We do need to do a better job of not giving up soft goals, which I think we gave two or three soft goals up [last weekend] … We really need to tighten the defense.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will then travel to Anteater Stadium on Sunday to face Irvine (6-7 overall, 2-0 Big West), which was picked to finish second in conference during the preseason, and is currently tied for first. Irvine has a decisive home-field advantage over the Gauchos who haven’t won at UCI since 2005 and haven’t scored there since 2007.</p>\n<p>“I think [UC Irvine’s] field is a lot smaller than ours, so there’s less to work with.

Freshman midfielder Sara Feder will start as the team’s lone forward. Freshmen attacking midfielders Angelisa Cortez and Mayra Almazan will play on opposite sides of Mead to solidify the offense.</p>\n<p>“[Offense has] definitely been an issue we struggled with last year,” Stumpf said. “We are going to be very young up front… We’re going to be using the whole preseason to hopefully get them more and more comfortable in conference and the college game.”</p>\n<p>Senior captain Erin Ortega provides needed leadership for the young Gauchos. As defensive midfielder, Ortega played in all 20 games last season, scoring three goals and notching two assists, while garnering Second Team All-Big West accolades and entering this year on the Preseason All-Conference team.</p>\n<p>“Leadership on this team is a hard role because there are so many young girls that are looking up to you,” Ortega said. “I always have to watch over my shoulder and try and lead by example. I’m going to try to have the best season I’ve had here.” Four Gauchos will anchor the defensive line, including surprise choice senior Dyanne Anderson who started on offense last year, scoring a team-high four goals.</p>\n<p>If UCSB plans on competing in the Big West, junior goalkeeper Makenna Henry will have to come up big against opponents. A Preseason All-Conference selection, Henry was a bright spot for the team last season. She recorded five clean sheets last season and looks to be the big defensive stopper for the Gauchos this year as well.</p>\n<p>“We need [Henry] to make the good saves all the time and we need her to make the great saves every now and then to keep us in the game,” Stumpf said. “Her foot skills keep getting better and her confidence keeps growing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will be tested early on in the season, playing 10 non-conference games, including matchups against Indiana and No. 19 Illinois. Conference play begins with UC Davis visiting Harder Stadium on Sept. 28. The Gauchos close the regular season against rival Cal Poly on Oct. 28.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47498\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/young-gauchos-rise-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47498\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/young-gauchos-rise-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/young-gauchos-rise-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/young-gauchos-rise-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-08-22/young-gauchos-rise-big-west/","id":1663,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1662,1661,1660],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season, Earns Second Place","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its final series of the season, the UCSB softball team completed a sweep of Cal State Northridge this past weekend to end on a seven-game winning streak.

Jennings’ seventh home run of the season was the most of any Gaucho this year. With the game 2-1 in the sixth inning, senior outfielder Brooke Putich singled with the bases loaded to add to the lead.</p>\n<p>Freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom, who went on to pitch all 21 innings of the series, struck out six batters and limited the Matadors to one run on three hits for a 4-1 win.</p>\n<p>“We were engaged in the win; our defense made the plays and our offense adjusted,” senior catcher Lainey DePompa said. “We enjoyed each other and really playing together. Being present in the moment is what we did.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos had no trouble scoring runs in the second game of Friday’s doubleheader. With the game scoreless, UCSB exploded in the fourth inning for a five-run inning. The Gauchos added on two extra runs in the seventh inning as Wisdom delivered her fifth home run of the season, a two-run blast over the left center field fence for a 7-0 win.</p>\n<p>Friday’s first match saw Wisdom’s first collegiate no-hitter. Wisdom retired the first nine batters she faced in order as the Gaucho offense also struggled manufacturing a run. Not until the seventh were the Gauchos able to break through with RBI hits by junior outfielder Jessica Soria and sophomore second baseman Kathryn Pilpil to win 2-0.</p>\n<p>Only two Matador runners were able to reach base, both on fielding errors as Wisdom broke the school record for most strikeouts in a season in the process; she finished with 247 strikeouts on the season and 24 wins.</p>\n<p>“We expected [Wisdom] to do great things before she got here and she lived up to those expectations,” Galicinao said. “She’s really matured over the course of the year. It’s exciting we still have another three years with her.”</p>\n<p>With the season now over, the Gauchos will now turn their attention to next year where they will be lead by their two seniors, Jennings and Soria, and a talented supporting cast.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-14/ucsb-ends-season-earns-place/","id":966,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[965,964,963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Play in Final Series of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Two games behind first place Long Beach with one series left in the season, the UCSB softball team travels to Cal State Northridge today with the oppor- tunity to earn a Big West Championship crown.

With three other teams in conten- tion of receiving the conference’s auto- matic berth to the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos must sweep Northridge and have help along the way to win the pro- gram’s first title.</p>\n<p>“I feel good about our chances; I think we can come out strong against Northridge and sweep them,” junior shortstop infield- er Keilani Jennings said. “Our team is at a good place right now. We’re all clicking and as long as we stay within ourselves and play relaxed, I think we have a chance.”</p>\n<p>At 27-28 overall and 12-6 in confer- ence, the Gauchos have the opportunity to go over .500 for the first time this season with a sweep of the Matadors. If they sweep, it will mark the first time since 2008 that the Gauchos win 30 games in a season. Northridge, losers of five straight, come in 10-39 overall and 5-13 in league.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB is currently in a three-way tie for second place along with Pacific and UC Davis. The Gauchos need Pacific to beat first place Long Beach State twice this weekend and have UC Davis lose at least one game to secure the conference’s at-large bid to qualify for the postseason. If Long Beach only wins one game, the possibility of a three-way tie for first place exists, with UC Davis winning due to head-to-head competition against Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“It’s crazy that everything is coming down to this one weekend,” sophomore infielder Kathryn Pilpil said. “We have to do our job and hopefully the other teams can beat each other out so we can come in first in Big West.”</p>\n<p>Hoping to pitch the Gauchos into the postseason for the first time since 2007, freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom looks to put the finishing touches on her spectacu- lar freshman campaign. Already setting the school record for most wins in a season (21), Wisdom ranks No. 27 in the nation in strikeouts (227) and is seven strikeouts shy of breaking the school record for most in a season.</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos to come out on top this weekend, they must carry over the offense they displayed last weekend when they scored 17 runs in a sweep of Cal Poly. Freshman infielder Jenessa Jeppesen bat- ted .700 with two home runs and six RBIs on her way to being awarded Big West Player of the Week honors. The Gauchos manufactured runs through singles and bunts, and plan to use the same game plan this weekend.</p>\n<p>With the entire season going down to the wire, all the pressure is on the Gauchos to execute. Yet, the team is ready to handle what comes its way.</p>\n<p>“They’re playing the best they have all year long,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “We have to play the softball we’ve been playing, execute on offense, play good defense, get some good pitching and win every inning.”</p>\n<p>First pitch at Matador Diamond is scheduled for 1:30 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46855\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46855\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-11/gauchos-play-final-series-season/","id":962,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[961,960,959],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Perseverance at the Plate and Off the Field","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB softball team enters its final series of the season this weekend with a chance of winning the Big West for the first time in the program’s history.

It was just a feeling I guess.”</p>\n<p>Jennings came into the program as a freshman ready to make an immediate impact, starting the first nine games of her career. However, Jennings suffered a devastating setback when she broke her leg, sidelining her for the rest of the season.</p>\n<p>“That was literally the first time I’ve ever been injured; I knew I wasn’t going to be able to play for the rest of the year,” Jennings said. “The second it happened I knew I broke my leg. It was definitely scary because I heard it crack and I was kind of in shock.”</p>\n<p>Despite suffering the season-ending injury, Jennings redshirted and returned the next year to lead the team in home runs and was one of three Gauchos to play in every single game, fulfilling the potential that was realized from her the year before.</p>\n<p>Building on her strong sophomore campaign, Jennings began the 2011 season by playing in 41 games and leading the team in batting average, slugging percentage and home runs. All was going according to schedule until injury struck Jennings once again. This time, a torn ACL sidelined her with another season-ending injury.</p>\n<p>“My second injury last year was harder; it was a different kind of feeling when you tear your ACL but I knew something was wrong because I wasn’t able to get up,” Jennings said. “It was really hard because your role as a teammate changes more as a supporter rather than actually being able to affect what’s going on on the field.”</p>\n<p>Yet, despite suffering another devastating injury, Jennings was determined to come back and play for the Gauchos in her final two seasons of eligibility.</p>\n<p>“I knew I would be able to come back,” Jennings said. “I wanted it bad enough to be able to come back and play. It’s the sport I love to play.”</p>\n<p>Now in her fourth year as a Gaucho, Jennings has not showed any signs of slowing down, playing a huge part in the run the team has made this season — a run that has UCSB within reach of a Big West title.</p>\n<p>“She’s come back from a lot; she’s been working hard and putting in the work necessary to come back,” Galicinao said. “Hitting in the fourth spot is challenging and she still has success hitting from that spot.”</p>\n<p>Because of her redshirt status, Jennings has the opportunity of becoming one of the greatest hitters in UCSB history before she leaves. Quickly climbing the record books, she currently ranks fourth overall for most home runs with 21, and has cracked the top 10 in doubles and runs batted in. However, even with a long list of statistical accolades to her name, Jennings still remains focused on the team goal of winning the Big West.</p>\n<p>“I’m not one to focus on stats,” Jennings said. “Coming into the season, obviously the big team goal is to be Big West champs.

But, looking ahead to next season, there is also reason for optimism — as long as Jennings is penciled into the lineup.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46789\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46789\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-09/perseverance-plate-field/","id":964,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[963,962,961],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sweeps Poly in Final Home Series","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its final homestand of the regular season, the UCSB softball team was able to stay in contention for first place in the Big West as the Gauchos completed a sweep of Cal Poly at Campus Diamond last ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its final homestand of the regular season, the UCSB softball team was able to stay in contention for first place in the Big West as the Gauchos completed a sweep of Cal Poly at Campus Diamond last weekend.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to get that sweep,” sophomore second baseman Kathryn Pilpil said. “It’s good we ended on a good note at Campus Diamond.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos are currently in a three-way tie for second place in the Big West with a 27-28 overall record and 12-6 in conference, two games behind Long Beach State with only one series left in the season.

With runners on the corners in the fourth, freshman pitcher Shelby Wisdom singled the runner home, and one out later, sophomore outfielder McKenzie Kane gave UCSB a 3-1 lead on an RBI single.</p>\n<p>Wisdom was able to take over the game, allowing only one other batter to reach base and striking out seven hitters total, pitching a complete game to get the win, 4-1.</p>\n<p>“We were so loose, even though the game was only a three-run win,” Pilpil said. “On the field, it didn’t seem like that even though it was only a 4-1 win, it felt much better than that.”</p>\n<p>More offense was on display for game two of the doubleheader as both teams combined for 24 hits in the matchup. Jeppesen gave the Gauchos a 1-0 lead in the second with a single, scoring the runner on third. Wisdom was victim to the long ball, giving up solo homeruns in the third and fourth innings to give the Mustangs a 2-1 lead.</p>\n<p>Down to their last out and trailing 4-3, junior shortstop Keilani Jennings belted her team-leading sixth home run of the season to send the game into extra innings. Cal Poly failed to advance two runners on base in the eighth, setting the stage for Jeppesen to drive home the game-winning run in the bottom of the inning on her fifth hit of the day.</p>\n<p>“Our plans in the bottom of the seventh were to just push one run across and push the game into extra innings, and with one swing we were able to do that,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They really believed they were going to win that game.”</p>\n<p>Five seniors were honored in their final home game before the start of the third game. In the series finale, UCSB again came out swinging early in the game by way of the long ball; with runners on second and third, Jeppesen hit a three-run homerun for a 3-0 lead. UCSB added two more runs — one in the fourth inning and one in the fifth — as Wisdom dominated from the mound.</p>\n<p>Wisdom threw a complete game shutout, allowing only three hits and striking out at least one batter in every inning. The game was called after the sixth inning as the Gauchos put up three more runs and won 8-0 on the mercy rule.</p>\n<p>“They did a good job of focusing, and all the seniors played a role in the win,” Galicinao said. “It was really good for the seniors to cap off their final home game like that.”</p>\n<p>UCSB now goes on the road this Friday to Cal State Northridge with the potential of winning the Big West if Long Beach State stumbles in the final weekend of play.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46697\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46697\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-07/ucsb-sweeps-poly-final-home-series/","id":963,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[962,961,960],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":10,"highestPage":11,"route":"/authors/65"}},"__N_SSG":true}
