Yet, she established herself this year as an elite player in the Big West, leading the league in shutouts and becoming the centerpiece of the Gaucho defense. What seems more improbable is that none of it should have happened.</p>\n<p>A career-ending injury to starting senior goalkeeper Makenna Henry in the beginning of the season gave way to Ritter emerging as UCSB’s goalkeeper of the future. With one collegiate career beginning and the other coming to an end, something special between Ritter and Henry developed through the course of the season: a relationship strengthened by adversity and friendship.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Mak is my number one role model on this team,” Ritter said. “I learned so much from her work ethic and her desire to play well and get better every single day … she’s the captain of our team, so she leads like no other and I just try to be like her as much as possible.”</p>\n<p>Although they are two years apart in age, the two have a lot more in common other than just being goalkeepers for the Gauchos. In fact, going back to last season, the two have shared a common bond with one another.</p>\n<p>In Ritter’s first year, she sat out the entire year as a redshirt freshman recovering from knee surgery. Before that, Ritter did not play in her final two years in high school because of knee injuries suffered before. With five knee surgeries in total, Ritter did not know if she would ever step onto the field again.</p>\n<p>“It was hard in college to watch my team play and not really be a part of it other than just a cheerleading aspect,” Ritter said.</p>\n<p>While Ritter was recovering during her first year, Henry suffered a right knee injury during a pre-conference game that severely limited her abilities. Henry toughened out the injury for the entire season even though she was forced to play with a knee brace.</p>\n<p>That knee brace brought with it its challenges: a reduction in her mobility, agility and even how she kicked the ball. Yet, one player was always there for Henry the entire season despite all the hard times.</p>\n<p>“I was struggling to get through season, [but Beth] was helping me all the way through, giving me little pick-me-ups here and there,” Henry said. “It was nice getting through a training session with someone who knew exactly what the struggles were.”</p>\n<p>Ritter knew exactly what those struggles were considering she had been dealing with knee injuries since high school and still at UCSB. For Ritter, her first year playing with Makenna was more than just learning and getting healthy; it was the start of her becoming a soccer player again.</p>\n<p>“[Makenna] used to bring me out when I was injured and work with me even if I couldn’t run, if I couldn’t dive,” Ritter said. “She would kick balls to my hand when no one else even acknowledged that I was on the team. She really set me up for the opportunity to start playing.”</p>\n<p>Flash-forward to this year and a fully healthy Ritter is able to finally play soccer for the first time in years, making her UCSB debut in the second game of the season against Weber State in a 1-1 draw.</p>\n<p>What she originally thought was going to be a year of cheerleading on the bench suddenly became a lot more when Henry could no longer go on playing injured.</p>\n<p>In her first game taking over for Henry versus Pacific University, Ritter had to deal with the usual nervousness, but instead of concentrating on herself, Ritter kept one person in mind the entire time.</p>\n<p>“What was really going through my mind was don’t let [Makenna] down. You’re playing for her right now,” Ritter said. “That’s all I needed to tell myself, play for Makenna, because as long as you focus on that, you’re not going to worry about yourself and worry about your decisions. I knew she would be proud of me if I played well.”</p>\n<p>Not only did UCSB win that game in overtime 1-0, Ritter was correct in making Henry proud of her when she revealed what she was thinking about during the game to Henry.</p>\n<p>“She actually did reveal that to me in one of our talks that we always have after our practices,” Henry said. “It’s a really huge honor to hear that from someone you respect as a person and as a goalkeeper. When she told me that, I was at a loss for words.”</p>\n<p>From that game on, Ritter showed what she was capable of accomplishing when fully healthy. Stepping in for Henry, Ritter had one of the best seasons by a UCSB goalkeeper ever recorded. At one point in the season Ritter had five straight shutouts, ending the season with the most in the Big West with eight and coming in second in save percentage at .826.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Ritter is quick to point out that it would not have been possible without her defenders and what she learned from Henry.</p>\n<p>“She took the time after practice to tell me how she always carries me with her out in the field,” Henry said. “Whatever influence I’ve had on her, either leading by example on and off the field, it was really cool to see her succeed like that and to know I had some positive effect on her success.”</p>\n<p>With Ritter now taking over the reins for UCSB, she remains as motivated as ever and does not take for granted any moment she is on the field, considering the years she spent off it.</p>\n<p>“In this weird way our injuries kept us closer together because we understood the challenges that came with being injured,” Henry said. “We were able to be each other’s support system and each other’s confidants.”</p>\n<p>If there ever was a case of injuries bringing a stroke of serendipity with it, look no further than Makenna Henry and Beth Ritter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52831\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52831\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/the-powerful-bond-between-teammates/","id":1589,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1588,1587,1586],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Drop Match, Miss Postseason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB fells to Davis 1-0, ending its postseason hopes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>One goal was how close the UCSB women’s soccer team was from making its first Big West Tournament appearance since 2009.

They surpassed last season’s win total by four and recorded their most wins in a season since 2009.

We have to get a result if we want to continue,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “One of our goals all year has been to get to the Big West Tournament; clearly the only shot is to get a result, to get a win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have overcome their recent injuries to remain in contention this late into the conference season. In its last game, UCSB played without as many as seven starters, including freshman defender Sydney Fuertes. Fuertes had previously started all games in the season before her injury.</p>\n<p>Filling in the gap on defense left by Fuertes has been freshman Kailey Hackett and sophomore Savannah Francis. Despite the inexperience of both players, they have been helped by the experience of senior defender Taylor Gehring, junior midfielder Miranda Cornejo and sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter. The trio has helped UCSB to the second best goals against average in the league (0.86).</p>\n<p>“The team has only conceded 16 goals out of 18 games,” Stumpf said. “I would say those three specifically have kept us in more games more than anything.”</p>\n<p>Against UC Davis, the Gauchos will have a favorable matchup on defense considering the Aggies have a conference-low 13 goals scored in the entire year and have been shutout on six occasions on the year. Yet, the Gauchos will have to deal with UCD having home-field advantage.</p>\n<p>“There are no easy teams out there; it’s going to be tough. They have a system we like playing against, so some people are going to have to step up,” Stumpf said. “We’re still going to have to defend as well as we have in the first 18 games of the year.”</p>\n<p>On offense, UCSB is led by senior forward Allie Ariniello and junior midfielder Madison Beckley; each are tied with a team-high five goals. Ariniello uses her size to overwhelm her opponents and has been the clinical finisher on the team.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Beckley has been the spark off the bench, contributing with three assists as well. Together, they have put UCSB in third in league with 21 goals.</p>\n<p>Kick-off for Sunday’s game is scheduled at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 31, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-31/ucsb-travels-to-davis-with-postseason-on-the-line/","id":1588,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1587,1586,1585],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall in Blue-Green Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.25.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-vs.-Cal-Poly-SLO-Peter-Vandenbelt-20.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10.25.2013-UCSB-Womens-Soccer-vs.-Cal-Poly-SLO-Peter-Vandenbelt-20.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to rival Cal Poly on senior night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the only Blue-Green rivalry match of the season between the first and second place teams in the Big West, Cal Poly proved why they are in first place, defeating the UCSB women’s soccer team 2-1 on Friday in the final regular season game at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>Two second-half goals by the nation’s leading scorer, sophomore forward Elise Krieghoff, was enough to push the Mustangs past the Gauchos.

With the loss, UCSB drops to 9-8-1 overall and 3-4 in the conference. The defeat endangers the Gauchos’ chance of qualifying for the Big West Tournament for the first time since 2009. UCSB will need to at least win its next game against UC Davis to maintain any chance of qualifying for postseason play.</p>\n<p>It is the 12th time this season the Gauchos have been involved in a game decided by a one-goal margin, including all of its conference games.</p>\n<p>Despite emotions running high for the Gauchos after honoring their five seniors on Senior Night, UCSB came out flat in the first 15 minutes of the game. Under heavy pressure in the opening moments, Santa Barbara soon settled in to match Cal Poly’s intensity. With both sides playing evenly on both sides of the pitch, the game went scoreless into halftime.</p>\n<p>“There are extended periods where you have to weather the storm and after 15 or so minutes we weathered the storm,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “I think from then on the game was relatively even, but it did take us 15 or so minutes to match the energy.”</p>\n<p>It did not take long for Cal Poly to break the scoreless draw in the second half. Unable to score in any of her three shots taken in the first half, Krieghoff broke through in the 50th minute with a shot from outside of the box that lofted over sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter’s outstretched hand into the corner of the net.</p>\n<p>Just three minutes later, Krieghoff found the back of the net again for her 20th goal of the season. This time a breakdown resulted in Ritter leaving her goal early. Krieghoff sidestepped Ritter and had an open shot on goal to give Cal Poly a 2-0 advantage.</p>\n<p>“[In the] second half they just found their chances and put them away,” junior midfielder Miranda Cornejo said. “Honestly there was nothing we can do about [the first goal], it was about 30 yards out, a bender in the top so that was a tough one. [Kreighoff] is the number one scorer in the nation.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was not without its opportunities. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley had a shot rebound to her with the goalkeeper out of position and sent the ball just left of the open net. Not until the 80th minute did the Gauchos find the back of the net on a cross that connected with Beckley’s head, hitting the crossbar and pushed in by Ariniello. It was Ariniello’s team-high fifth goal.</p>\n<p>The last game of the regular season for UCSB will be a must-win road game at UC Davis on Sunday at 2 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 28, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52639\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52639\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-28/gauchos-fall-in-blue-green-rivalry/","id":1586,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1585,1584,1583],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Battles Rival Cal Poly for Postseason Positioning","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_12.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_12.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has a chance to make the conference tournament for the first time since 2009.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Most UCSB-Cal Poly matchups already come with an added amount of intensity; however, you will be hard-pressed to find a Blue-Green rivalry game with as much on the line as tomorrow’s game.

It’s exciting for all of us to be really close to reaching our goal.”</p>\n<p>UCSB currently stands at 9-7-1 overall and is in a second-place tie in the Big West conference at 3-3.

Meanwhile, UCSB has not played in the postseason since 2009, but with a victory it will inch closer.</p>\n<p>“The season is coming to an end and the girls are in a very good position to meet one of their goals and that is to get back to the Big West Tournament,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter has emerged as the Gauchos’ most consistent player in only her first year starting. All of UCSB’s wins this year have come by way of shutout with Ritter producing eight of those, the most by a Gaucho since 2003. In her last game, Ritter had a career-high 10 saves and shutout the opponent in the previous home game against UC Riverside.</p>\n<p>“Really it’s just the defense. We’re stepping up strong, we had a few starters out [against UC Riverside], so we had a makeshift lineup in our defense and they stepped up,” Ritter said. “Some freshman did great and carried the ball out of there.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will take advantage of a hampered UCSB squad that started two freshmen in the backline in its previous two games. Cal Poly sophomore forward Elise Krieghoff, the leading goal scorer in the country, will try to exploit Santa Barbara’s inexperience.</p>\n<p>Krieghoff has been named Big West Player of the Week five times already and her 18 goals is a school record and third all-time in Big West history.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t really been focusing on her in our game plan,” Gankema said. “We’re trying to focus on us and how we’re going to come out. We know that she has scored a lot of goals so we just have to make sure we do well in defending.”</p>\n<p>Besides playing to remain in postseason contention, an extra incentive is to send the five Gaucho seniors, including Gankema, off with a win in their final regular season home game of their careers.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to be really pumped up because I know it’s my last home game and we have a lot to prove, especially against Cal Poly,” Gankema said. “Just having the thought that it’s our last home game will help everyone want to work even harder, for the seniors and for each other.”</p>\n<p>Friday night’s match against Cal Poly is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 24, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52610\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/ucsb-battles-rival-cal-poly-for-postseason-positioning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52610\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/ucsb-battles-rival-cal-poly-for-postseason-positioning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/ucsb-battles-rival-cal-poly-for-postseason-positioning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/ucsb-battles-rival-cal-poly-for-postseason-positioning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-24/ucsb-battles-rival-cal-poly-for-postseason-positioning/","id":1579,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1578,1577,1576],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Pair of Weekend Matchups","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_07.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_07.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats UC Riverside 1-0 in OT, falls to Fullerton 1-0","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite earning its biggest win of the season this Friday at home against UC Riverside in a 1-0 overtime thriller, the UCSB women’s soccer team was unable to duplicate the same result Sunday against Cal State Fullerton, losing 1-0 on the road.</p>\n<p>Through three weeks of conference play, the Gauchos continue their pattern of splitting their weekend matches and are now 9-7-1 overall and 3-3 in the Big West.

Each side traded possession of the ball in the first half and the Gauchos limited UCR to only two shots.</p>\n<p>With time expiring in regulation, the Gauchos showed no sign of fatigue and sent the game to overtime, their first of the season.</p>\n<p>“One of the things we’ve talked about is their mentality and they’ve proved over the last two games in a row that there mentality is very good,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>Despite fatigue setting in, UCSB was quick to attack the opposition’s side of the goal in overtime, having four shots in five minutes before freshman midfielder McKinsey Martinez scored the game-winning golden goal. Martinez capitalized on an open shot inside the penalty box.</p>\n<p>“[The ball] was fumbling around, got hit a couple times and off defenders, just bounced out to my right foot and I volleyed it in,” Martinez said. “…This is my first game ever playing; it feels awesome being able to know that it’s finally my time.”</p>\n<p>At that point, Ritter continued adding to her impressive shutout streak. All of UCSB’s wins this year had come by way of shutout, eight of those with Ritter guarding the posts.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara now prepares for its final two games of the regular season where it will need to produce results to earn a spot in the Big West Tournament. The first game of the weekend against Cal Poly at home is scheduled for Friday at 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52551\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52551\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-21/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matchups/","id":1562,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1561,1560,1559],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sees Top Keepers in Pair of Games this Weekend","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Preview UCSB women's soccer vs. UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After splitting its road games last week, the UCSB women’s soccer team will stay at home to play UC Riverside this Friday before traveling to Cal State Fullerton on Sunday, in what is the team’s second-to-last week of conference play remaining.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes into the weekend’s matches with an overall record of 8-6-1 and 2-2 in the Big West conference.

Taking over the starting position at the beginning of the season, Ritter has amassed seven shutouts, the most in the Big West. The eight combined shutouts this year rank fifth in program history for a single season and the most since 2008.</p>\n<p>Although Ritter has been one of the hottest goalkeepers, the Gauchos will encounter goalies just as impressive this weekend. Both Riverside’s and Fullerton’s goalkeepers rank in the top three in save percentage and shutouts.</p>\n<p>UC Riverside suffered its first conference loss last week against UC Irvine by a 2-0 margin. Prior to that the Highlanders had outscored its opponents 5-1 in two league matches with much of the success due in large part to sophomore goalkeeper Elizabeth Silas who ranks fourth in the Big West in total saves (73). Silas has allowed only three goals in the last four games and has emerged as an elite goalkeeper in the Big West.</p>\n<p>After playing UC Riverside, Santa Barbara travels south to Fullerton for another conference challenge. Fullerton’s goalkeeper, senior Lindsey Maricic ranks first in save percentage and total saves so far this season, being a deciding factor in the two games the Titans have earned results in.</p>\n<p>Aside from Maricic on the defensive side of the ball, UCSB will also have to take into account senior midfielder/forward Erica Mazeau. Mazeau has played both her positions well this season, leading the team in goals with three and assists with four.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s defense has been the team’s backbone, however, the team has become a threat offensively. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley leads the team with five goals, ranking third in the league and sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez has notched three goals of her own for the team.</p>\n<p>Kick-off for Friday’s game against UC Riverside is scheduled for 7 p.m. and Sunday’s match versus Cal State Fullerton will begin at 6 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 17th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52512\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52512\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-17/ucsb-sees-top-keepers-in-pair-of-games-this-weekend/","id":1609,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1608,1607,1606],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Split Weekend Road Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_05.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_Sept29_05.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in fourth place in the Big West standings.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For its first road trip of the conference season, the UCSB women’s soccer team split its two games on the weekend, losing to the University of Hawaii on Thursday but bouncing back on Sunday for a 1-0 win against Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>With the split over the weekend, UCSB is now 8-6-1 overall and 2-2 in the Big West. The two conference wins are the same number of conference victories the Gauchos had all of last year. After Hawaii’s win on Thursday night, the Warriors improve to .500 at 6-6 on the season and are 1-2 in conference. Meanwhile, the Matador’s conference struggles continue as they remain winless at 0-3-1 and 5-9-1 overall.</p>\n<p>UCSB was quick to bounce back early against the Matadors after Thursday’s disappointing loss against the Warriors. In the 14th minute of play the Gauchos got on the board when sophomore midfielder Angelisa Cortez drew the goalkeeper out of the goal, after cutting past the defense. Cortez slid the ball to senior forward Allie Ariniello who had an open goal and put UCSB up 1-0.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>It was Ariniello’s fourth goal of the season, second-most on the team, and Cortez’s first assist on the year.</p>\n<p>The game remained even from there on going into the half. Possession of the ball switched between teams in the last 45 minutes of play; each team struggled to maintain control of the ball as the defense from both teams demonstrated solid play in the backline. UCSB benefitted from the early score and played defense against Northridge in the final minutes of the game.</p>\n<p>With less than five minutes left in the game, CSUN had one last shot on goal, but sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter blocked the ball for her second save of the game, giving UCSB the victory. The 1-0 result is the fourth occasion UCSB has won by that score and more notably, all of UCSB’s wins this year have come by way of shutout.</p>\n<p>UCSB travelled to Hawaii for its first road game of the conference season on Thursday; previously the Gauchos had been a respectable 2-3-1 away from Harder Stadium going into the match. Both teams were even in the first half and went tied 0-0 going into halftime, having the same number of shots in the first period with four each.</p>\n<p>Consistency has been a problem for the Gauchos in the second half of games with the team often wearing down towards the end of matches. Against the Warriors, UCSB again had a difficult time trying to maintain its same level of play. Hawaii outshot the Gauchos 9-4 in the second half and pressured Santa Barbara for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>With 10 minutes remaining, the UCSB defense let Hawaii’s main offensive threat let loose. Junior forward Tiana Fujimoto, who entered the game second in the Big West with six goals, ran past the defense and unleashed a shot from the left side of the field that deflected off the post, and into the back of the net.

When UCSB went on a five-game winning streak earlier in the season, her clean sheets in all those games were the most consecutive shutouts by a UCSB goalkeeper since 1989.</p>\n<p>“We’re not terribly surprised, but the fact that she stepped in with little or no experience has been huge,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “Just to have her step in and have her do as well as she did just from the word ‘go’ has been great.”</p>\n<p>Prior to the team’s last loss on Sunday versus Long Beach State, junior midfielder Madison Beckley had been red hot playing up top for UCSB. Beckley notched the only goal in Friday’s win against Irvine, bringing her goal total to five, the most on the team. Aside from her goals, Beckley has been creating scoring chances for the Gauchos by recording two assists, tied second on the team.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will rely on its home crowd for tonight’s matchup. Last season, the Rainbow Wahine were not able to win a conference game on the road, yet only lost one league game when playing in Hawaii. A key point of emphasis for Santa Barbara will be the passing game. Turnovers by way of errant passes derailed the Gauchos offensive opportunities in its last lost.</p>\n<p>“[The game plan] doesn’t really change terribly. We want to do what we do well,” Stumpf said. “Some of the goals we have is we want to possess the ball 65 percent of the game or more, we want to create more chances for ourselves.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will have to be on lookout for junior forward Tiana Fujimoto who has scored six goals on the season, second in the league, and is the Warrior’s main threat on offense.</p>\n<p>Once the Gauchos finish playing the Warriors, they will head back to California for a matchup against Cal State Northridge (5-7-1 overall, 0-1-1 conference). Despite the long distance traveled in few days, the players are set on playing at the same level of intensity.</p>\n<p>“We have that Friday, Saturday gap so I don’t think we’ll be that concerned with Sunday’s game,” sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez said. “It’s about mentality, so you got to go out there and think [you’re] going to win.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Cynthia Tafoya will guard the back of the net for the Matadors and will present trouble for UCSB offensively; her 44 saves on the season are fifth in the league.</p>\n<p>Kickoff for tonight’s match against Hawaii is scheduled for 10 p.m. and Sunday’s game at Cal State Northridge will begin at 4 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of October 10th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52414\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52414\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-10/gauchos-travel-to-hawaii-for-first-road-trip-of-season/","id":1605,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1604,1603,1602],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Making a Difference on and Off the Field","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A women's soccer feature on freshman Kailey Hackett.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Playing in the Mecca of college soccer under the Friday night lights every week is what all collegiate soccer players dream of although few actually get to experience it.</p>\n<p>However, some of these soccer players can get lost in the shuffle off the pitch once the referee blows the final whistle.

It’s basically a day for them to come to our school,” Hackett said. “We play with them, basically make their day and are with them.”</p>\n<p>The program, which celebrated its fifth anniversary last year, is free of cost and held at Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, CA — the very school that Hackett attended. Designed for children ages five and up with special needs, the program allows for each of the kids to get the opportunity to develop their skills and self-esteem through soccer.</p>\n<p>Besides participating in soccer activities, the children spend plenty of time interacting with the volunteers in various other events organized, such as face painting, balloon art and giveaways.</p>\n<p>The matter hits close to home for Hackett, who was inspired to volunteer after hearing the story of one of her best friend’s cousins being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. That account encouraged Hackett to participate in TOPSoccer, a decision that has left just as big of a mark on her as it does on the children she helps. Although the program runs for only one day, it still leaves Hackett with a profound sense of self every year.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, it feels really awesome because you’re doing something for someone else and having that feeling — there are no words to describe it really,” Hackett said. “I’m very thankful for everything and my health and being a part of making them happy.”</p>\n<p>Despite her endeavors outside of the soccer field, Hackett is quick to remind the crowd of how good of a player she is when she does step onto the grass.</p>\n<p>In the first games of the season, Hackett has complemented the defense of the Gauchos and earned herself considerable playing time for a freshman. In nine games played so far, she has started four of them and proven to be a valuable asset to an already strong defense that features four seniors in the backline. In fact, Hackett was a part of four of UCSB’s shutout wins when it went on a five-game winning streak earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>“We brought her in to play center back,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We kind of expect Kailey, once [the starters] graduate, to really kind of step in and be that starter that’s going to play an awful lot of minutes at the center back spot.”</p>\n<p>Accustomed to the big stage in high school where she led her team to a CIF championship, the college game brings with it some challenges and a learning curve Hackett still has to adjust to. Just like any other freshman playing for a different team, her first instances wearing the UCSB uniform brought an array of emotions to her, considering how far she has come and what she has given in the past.</p>\n<p>“It was nerve-racking and exciting at the same time because I worked really hard to get this far,” Hackett said. “It feels rewarding because I worked really hard to get to where I am right now.”</p>\n<p>When she is not tackling the ball away from defenders, Hackett is busy tackling the books. Her soccer aspirations fall in line with her academics and just like any student athlete, she still juggles time between the gym and the classroom.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty stressful because of how much homework we have but I think it’s really awesome at the same time because you’re involved with so much stuff,” said Hackett.</p>\n<p>When the season ends, Hackett plans on returning to her hometown of Coto de Caza where she will join TOPSoccer once again for the winter at her high school. Despite all the shots she has taken while playing, it was the shot Hackett took off the pitch that has stayed with her the most, and which she encourages everyone to take.</p>\n<p>“No matter what, I think people should just go out there and give it a shot and put those kids and those people before you,” Hackett said.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is scheduled for Thursday at 10 p.m. against the University of Hawaii.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52401\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52401\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/making-a-difference-on-and-off-the-field/","id":1602,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1601,1600,1599],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_093012-7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MagaliGauthier_WSoccer_093012-7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Irvine but falls to Long Beach.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With every victory there is always room for improvement. That is the story for the UCSB women’s soccer team after this past weekend’s games. Despite defeating UC Irvine 1-0 on Friday in its conference opener, the Gauchos suffered a disappointing loss to Long Beach State on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“The simple truth is we got beat by a better team. [Long Beach was] a little more technical, they were a little more athletic and we started off flat,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “We got beat by a better team. The good news is on the weekend, we’re 1-1.”</p>\n<p>After this past weekend, the Gauchos’ record stands at 7-5-1 overall and 1-1 in the Big West conference. Long Beach improves to 7-5-0 and 1-1 in the league while the Anteaters are 6-5 and 1-1 in conference after its two games during the weekend.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Long Beach started the game strong and controlled UCSB in the first moments of the game, using its tactics to keep the ball away from the Gauchos and attacking offensively for a majority of the first half.</p>\n<p>In the 31st minute of play, Long Beach got inside the box and had a series of shots on goal until a shot deflected off a UCSB defender and shot past the goalkeeper into the back of the net for a 1-0 49er advantage. CSULB was not finished for the half and scored again eight minutes later when junior midfielder Taylor Nelson shot from distance into the corner of the goal to put the 49ers up by two heading into the second half.</p>\n<p>“Momentum is a really hard thing to turn around,” Stumpf said. “We were really chasing the game for the first 20, 30 minutes.”</p>\n<p>With adjustments made coming into the second half, UCSB was nearly able to even the game but was still unable to establish any rhythm offensively. Long Beach’s early momentum was enough to carry them past the Gauchos for a 2-1 win. After a shutout win on Friday, the Gaucho defense was not on par with Friday’s performance.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Sunday game, it’s hot in the afternoon and [the defense] played a lot of minutes on Friday night,” sophomore forward Angelisa Cortez said. “They worked hard, the best they can do … They played to the maximum of their ability.”</p>\n<p>Despite getting behind in the first half against Long Beach, Friday’s match against UC Irvine brought better results for the Gauchos. The two teams were in a defensive stalemate for the first half until UCSB broke through late with a goal in the 44th minute. Junior midfielder Madison Beckley headed in a cross for her team-high fifth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>UCI entered the second half with more inspired play and became aggressors on the offensive side of the pitch. Being limited to only three shots in the first 45 minutes of the game, the Anteaters had 10 shots in the second half. However, the solid Gaucho defense remained on point and kept UCI from getting off a serious threat on goal.</p>\n<p>In the final minutes of the game, the Gauchos began to slow down, causing Irvine to take advantage of the worn-out defensive. UCSB was able to survive the late scare by the Anteaters to hang on to the 1-0 win.</p>\n<p>“I think we only won two conference games all last year and I kind of put Irvine at the top of the pile in the teams in the Big West, so to get a result off them on a Friday night at home is great,” Stumpf said.</p>\n<p>It was UCSB’s sixth shutout win in its last eight games before losing on Sunday. Sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter continued her stellar play between the nets, coming up huge for five saves to preserve Friday’s shutout.</p>\n<p>UCSB will now travel to Hawaii to face the Warriors on Thursday, followed by another road game against Cal State Northridge on Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-07/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-matches/","id":1600,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1599,1598,1597],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Play UCI, LBSU for First Big West Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-Soccer-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/W-Soccer-file-photo.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB women's soccer vs. UCI, LBSU preview","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over a month of preparation has led up to this moment.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, the UCSB women’s soccer team begins its long awaited conference season at home against UC Irvine.

Nevertheless, that is all a distant memory for the team now that the real season is about to start. All that matters is league.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine had success similar to the Gauchos during its nonconference schedule and comes into Harder Stadium with a 5-4 overall record.</p>\n<p>In September, UCI upset BYU, which was ranked No.6 in the country at the time, in what was the program’s biggest victory against a ranked opponent.</p>\n<p>Irvine still showed it has room for improvement though as in its most recent game they were picked apart by Washington State for a 4-0 loss.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB has the advantage of playing at home where they are 4-1, the Anteaters showcase an identical record on the road that the Gauchos have at home, including impressive victories against Oregon and Oregon State.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has been led offensively by junior midfielder/forward Madison Beckley, who has had a breakout season thus far. She scored the lone goal for UCSB in the last game to give her four on the season, a team-high and third overall in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Although she has started only three games, her role coming off the bench has translated to better offensive flow for the team as a whole. The Gauchos have been a surprise offensively this year as UCSB is tied with Cal Poly for most goals scored in the Big West with 16 and third in assists with 16 as well.</p>\n<p>Despite the offense being a surprise, the defense UCSB has shown has been on point with what was expected of them in the beginning of the year even though original starting goalkeeper Makenna Henry has been sidelined with injury for the past seven games. Sophomore Beth Ritter has filled in between the post and is leading the league in goals-against average (0.61), goals against (5) and is second in save percentage (.821).</p>\n<p>Irvine has a balanced attack offensively with seven different players on the team scoring and junior forward Laura McGrail leading the team in goals with four on the season. The Irvine defense will give UCSB trouble as they have carried the team as evident by its four shutouts.</p>\n<p>Long Beach will pose just as much of a threat, if not more. for Santa Barbara. The 49ers have the best winning percentage in the Big West with a 6-4 overall record with their best win coming by a 1-0 score line against ranked BYU after its defeat by Irvine; it was only BYU’s fourth lost in its last 32 games.</p>\n<p>Sophomore goalkeeper Kaci McCain has been stellar guarding the net for Long Beach.

Up against the 19th ranked team in the country at Harder Stadium, the Gauchos lost 2-1 on a late second-half goal, despite the tenacity they showcased.</p>\n<p>The loss drops UCSB to 6-4-1 overall and marks the second time this season the Gauchos have dropped consecutive games. With the victory, the Pioneers move to 8-1-1 on the year as they remain consistent on the road.</p>\n<p>UCSB made it a priority to control Denver’s main offensive weapon in senior forward Kristen Hamilton and kept her in check throughout much of the match.

The defense, which has been a strong point of the team for the season, gave up a goal via a corner kick in the 18th minute to make the match 1-0.</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Brooke Boothe settled the ball on the pass from senior midfielder Nicholette DiGiacomo and lifted it over the goalkeeper to give the Pioneers the lead going into halftime. Santa Barbara responded with a goal coming out of the half.</p>\n<p>In the 52nd minute, junior midfielder Madison Beckley received the ball from sophomore defender Savannah Francis at the top of the box and shot it past the Pioneer defense and into the left corner of the net to draw the game even at one goal apiece. The goal was Beckley’s fourth goal of the season, giving her the most of the team.</p>\n<p>From there on, the game was an even stalemate with each team struggling to maintain ball possession. However, much as it has done for most of the season, Denver began to wear down its opponent as the game got deeper into the second half. The Pioneers began to increase the pressure and had a series of shots on target against the goalkeeper, getting as close as hitting the crossbar.</p>\n<p>The pressure from Denver proved to be overwhelming for the Gauchos who were called for a foul inside the box in the 76th minute of the game. Junior defender Sam Harder stepped up to the spot and kicked it past sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter to give the Pioneers the 2-1 advantage.</p>\n<p>Denver held the Gauchos in check for the remaining time left on the clock and controlled the pace of the game after scoring the go-ahead goal, ultimately defeating the Gauchos 2-1.</p>\n<p>Denver benefitted from being the aggressors on the pitch as they outshot the Gauchos 15-8. However, most of the damage done by the Pioneers came in the second half, as they had an impressive 12 shots and limited Santa Barbara to only one shot in the period. The sluggish second-half play of the Gauchos was in direct contrast to its play in the first half, where they had seven shots on goal.</p>\n<p>The next game of the season will begin the start of conference play for the Gauchos as they host UC Irvine at Harder Stadium. The Anteaters enter the game with a record of 5-4 overall. Kick-off for Friday’s game against the Anteaters is scheduled to start at 5 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52227\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52227\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/ucsb-drops-decision-to-no-19-denver/","id":1598,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1597,1596,1595],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Look to Finish Non-Conference Play Strong","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Soccer-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/W-Soccer-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"As the first Big West game of the season approaches next week, the UCSB women’s soccer team prepares for its final preseason match against the University of Denver on Sunday.

Having allowed a total of only eight goals in 10 matches, the Gauchos will continue to rely on their defense against the Pioneers on the road.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters Sunday’s contest winners of six games this season, having lost three with one draw, and have the highest winning percentage of any team in the Big West thus far. Prior to last Sunday versus then-ranked No. 17 Texas Tech, the Gauchos were on a five-game winning streak and shut out all of it opponents during the stretch. However, Santa Barbara was victim to a defensive miscue and a free kick to fall 2-0 against the Red Raiders.</p>\n<p>Unlike last season where the strength of the team lacked a definitive answer, this year the clear source of effectiveness for the Gauchos has been defense. What is more impressive has been the play of sophomore goalkeeper Beth Ritter, who has filled in perfectly for injured senior goalkeeper Makenna Henry. Listed at only 5’4”, Ritter currently leads the league in goals-against average with 0.41 in seven games played.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Notable results on the offensive end of the pitch can also be credited to UCSB’s good play entering its game against Denver. Contrast to the prior season where the Gauchos failed to convert on their scoring opportunities, UCSB has scored 15 goals in its games played which is tied for first in the Big West along with Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Although distribution of the ball has been key with eight different players scoring goals, the trio of junior midfielder Madison Beckley, senior forward Allie Ariniello and junior midfielder Indiana Mead have excelled in their roles as playmakers for the team.</p>\n<p>Beckley and Ariniello lead the squad with three goals scored and have two assists each. Mead has scored two goals, notched two assists and done an excellent job of creating her own shots, as evident by her team-high 19 shots.</p>\n<p>Like the Gauchos’ previous opponent, Denver comes in ranked at No. 21 in the country.

That is the saying going around the UCSB women’s soccer team this year and that which the players have embraced as they prepare for the start of the season.<br>\nAn aggressive mentality and gritty play on the field, as well as the new motto, will be the backbone for this UCSB team.<br>\n“I think we have as reasonable a shot as everyone else,” Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. “All the big teams in the Big West are so close that on any given day one person can kind of turn the other over. I think we have just as good of a shot as anyone just as long as we stay healthy.”<br>\nUCSB comes in with the goal of qualifying for the Big West Conference Tournament for the first time since 2009. Last season, Santa Barbara finished in ninth place in the league with only seven points earned in total.<br>\nThis season UCSB was picked to finish sixth in the Big West Conference Coach’s Poll. However, the Gauchos will have to stay healthy and overcome a lack of goal scoring that plagued the team last season. Although four players underwent offseason surgery and will not be ready for the early part of the season, the majority of the team enters in strong shape and focused on avoiding injury.<br>\n“We don’t want to have as many injuries as we did last year,” senior defender Lindsay Gankema said. “We all came in fit, which helped and we’re going to work in the weight room.”<br>\nSanta Barbara managed only 19 goals last season, the fewest in the entire league. Because of an inability to finish on many scoring opportunities, 13 new players were brought in this year with the intention of creating plays on offense and putting the ball on frame.<br>\n“A lot of them have different personalities on the field, meaning they have different styles of play,” junior midfielder Indiana Mead said. “I think they’re really technical, so they bring a new spark on the team we definitely needed.”<br>\nAdded playing time will also give experience to the freshman and add depth to offset potential injury down the stretch. Although the new freshman will try to make an impact early on, team chemistry is still something that the Gauchos have to develop in the first month of their non-conference schedule as they prepare for league play beginning in October.<br>\n“We’re working on [chemistry] because chemistry is important,” Gankema said. “I wouldn’t say it is necessarily hard but it’s going to take a little bit of time.”<br>\nThe blueprint for the Gauchos’ success this season centers primarily on the defensive end of the pitch. Four seniors will play defense for the Gauchos including twin sisters Paige and Lindsay Gankema and center back Taylor Gehring, who returns from injury this season. Four-year starting goalkeeper Makenna Henry, who played injured for a large portion of last season, will command the posts again this year.<br>\n“Defensively we will be very strong …  most of us have been really close on and off the field and we already have that chemistry,” Gankema said. “We all work really well together, we read each other very well and get back for each other and that makes us strong.”<br>\nUCSB plays 11 non-conference matches with its first conference game at home against UC Irvine on Oct 4.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 16 of August 28, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cedar Lay of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/gauchos-look-strong-on-the-backline/","id":1624,"author":{"id":65,"name":"Mark Salay"},"related":[1623,1622,1621],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":6,"highestPage":11,"route":"/authors/65"}},"__N_SSG":true}
