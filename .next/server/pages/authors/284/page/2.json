In the 33rd minute, redshirt junior forward Matt Baringer found himself on the receiving end of a deflection, which he fired into the net for his fifth goal of the season. The unassisted effort added on to the team’s early lead, increasing the Aggies’ lead to 2-0, landing the Gauchos in an even deeper ditch.</p>\n<p>Right before the end of the first half, in the 41st minute, senior defender Kyle Higgins found himself on the breakaway while dribbling a pass from teammate Onah Power, managing to get past a Davis defender to find the back of the net.</p>\n<p>The first half was brought to an end with the Aggies on top 3-0, bringing back deja vu of the two teams’ previous match which ended with a 3-0 shutout victory.</p>\n<p>By halftime, the Gauchos defense had given up five shots to the Aggies and Carrillo did not manage to make a single save. The defense was shaky in the first half and was able to constantly create chances on the offensive end. The Davis defense was able to hold the Gauchos to no shots at halftime, as the home team just could not get too many good looks at the net.</p>\n<p>The second half kicked off and it was much of the same from the Davis offense. The rhythm the team had found in the first half had clearly continued into the second, with the team being able to notch another point on the board when Power was able to find senior Noah Wilson to make the game 4-0, in the 57th minute. Power notched his first two assists of the season to tie him for third best on the team.</p>\n<p>It was only five minutes later that the Aggies were able to score again with Mickelson striking yet again for his fourth goal on the season. The game ended 5-0 in favor of Davis.</p>\n<p>The multi-point nights from multiple Aggies in Saturday’s matchup were an indicator of the Gauchos’ collapse on defense. Excluding the first goal, each half had the scores occur within ten minutes of each other.</p>\n<p>The Aggies’ various quick bursts on offense were able to cut through the Gauchos’ defense, who left too many open looks, too many times on the pitch. Davis finished with 12 shots, of which half were shots on goal.</p>\n<p>Carrillo ended the match with just one save. It was a tough night for the keeper who was outstanding in play last week. The UCSB offense was able to take four shots in the second half, but forced the Davis keepers to only make one save. Senior midfielder Seo-in Kim was responsible for both of the Gauchos’ two shots on goal.</p>\n<p>The five goals allowed and no goals scored performance by the Gauchos is a sign that the team and Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg have some corrections to make upon the postseason’s arrival in the first week of November.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-23/gauchos-endure-worst-home-loss-in-more-than-25-years/","id":1383,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1382,1381,1380],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Anticipates Its Home Finale, Will Host UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.10.14_StephenManga_MSoccer-23-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017.10.14_StephenManga_MSoccer-23-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos look to ride the momentum of a 2-1 win over Sac State which put them back in first place in the Big West North as it takes on UC Davis.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Harder Stadium welcomes the Gauchos for the last Saturday night home game of the regular season, during which they will play the UC Davis Aggies just three games away from the start of the postseason.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara comes into this matchup fresh off a 2-1 Golden Goal victory at Sac State Wednesday and now boasts a 6-5-4 overall record.

The goalkeeper also added two more saves in the match against the Hornets.</p>\n<p>Carrillo has played outstandingly, and his six shutouts are a testament to his ability as a goalkeeper. The six clean sheets on the season for the keeper also speak to the defensive success of this team, as the Gauchos have often relied on their defense to keep them in a game in which their offense was slow to start.</p>\n<p>His 0.96 goals against average ranks first in the Big West, while his 0.75 save percentage ranks second and his 15 goals allowed ranks third.</p>\n<p>The offense has shown their strong capability to score throughout the season, particularly in a 5-2 win against Cal State Fullerton. Fellow freshman forward Randy Michael played a huge role in the Gauchos’ offensive resurgence over the last nine games, in which they’ve gone 6-1-2.</p>\n<p>Michael has scored all seven of his goals in these past nine games, including two scores against Sac State on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The seven shots in goal rank tied for second in the Big West. The California native also has four assists on the year, the best mark on the team, as well as his 18 total points.</p>\n<p>The Saturday night match presents an opportunity for the youthful squad to address the problems seen in their last matchup against Davis: defensive struggles from the keeper down through the defense and onto an offense, which could not answer Davis back after allowing each goal.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a very good shot at seeing Davis again in the postseason, and it will be better for the Gauchos to beat Davis and address the concerns now than to have to do it later on, especially when it comes to securing a possible first-round bye for the first week of the Big West Tournament.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play the Aggies at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 21, at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p><img class=\"ajT\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif?w=888&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Oct. 19, 2017, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79183\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79183\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-19/ucsb-anticipates-its-home-finale-will-host-uc-davis/","id":1380,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1379,1378,1377],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Part One of Blue-Green Rivalry Ends in a Draw","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Harder Stadium was rocking as the UCSB men's soccer team hosted its longtime rival Cal Poly Saturday night.

Cal Poly was able to regularly test the Gaucho defense and took five shots in the half, forcing UCSB’s goal keeper Alan Carrillo to make some incredible saves.</p>\n<p>The freshman keeper turned away a near score in the 61st minute; the result of a well serviced cross from the left side of the box and a well-placed shot that Carrillo was able to dive in front of. In the final 10 minutes of the match, Carrillo found himself having to stop a high shot to the top left of the net that he incredibly punched away and out of play. The conclusion of regulation play left the match scoreless, forcing the third double overtime match in the month of October for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly was able to pose another goal scoring threat yet again in the first OT period, sending a free kick ball into the box that was headed on target, but Carrillo was able to strike it down. The ball was then sent off the left post on a shot off of the save which Carrillo promptly got on top of.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos just could not find the offensive rhythm that they had in their victories earlier in conference play. The defensive play from UCSB was also concerning as from the start of the second half in regulation, Cal Poly was able to take control and create their own chances for shots on goal. The shaky defense from the Gauchos forced their keeper Carrillo to stand on his head throughout the match, keeping the team within range to win the game.</p>\n<p>“I think we were only able to break once and within five seconds there five players on top of us,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The rest of the time our center backs are at midfield looking into ten players and knowing that if you make a bad pass then you’re open on the right and the left and that’s when Alan made those two saves.”</p>\n<p>While exciting, the Gauchos were certainly hoping for a better result from the Blue-Green rivalry as they ended the week of play with a 0-1-1 record.</p>\n<p>The UCSB men’s soccer team found themselves heading into this week’s play with a full head of steam. The six game unbeaten streak for the club allowed the squad to climb the conference standings early in the season, bringing the team to the top of the North division, three points ahead of UC Davis, with ten points.</p>\n<p>The position the Gauchos find themselves at the conclusion of this week’s play is now second in the North division, two points behind UC Davis, with 11 points.</p>\n<p>The team is now finding themselves in a place of adversity. After two challenging games, the Gauchos will now face the challenge of making another climb up the standings with only four games remaining in the regular season. The Gauchos don’t need to run the table, but they do need to get enough favorable results in the remaining matches to get/stay ahead of UC Davis, who are looking like a threat to UCSB’s plans of taking the conference crown.</p>\n<p>Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg referenced the youth off the team saying, “We got to the top of the box and shot where we have one more pass to make and we didn’t do it. It’s young, it’s inexperience, it’s the crowd, and we just need someone who can handle the ball well.”</p>\n<p>The play from the young group of freshmen on the team, goalkeeper Alan Carrillo, forward Sahid Conteh and forward Rodney Michael, has been key to the Gaucho’s success this season.</p>\n<p>However, the team has been shutout twice in their last two games and have a three game winless streak. The addition of junior Joseph Ammer, who has been out since September 15th with an injury, can fully complete the offense and has the team waiting for his return to the pitch headed into the late season push.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will play their next game on the road against the Sacramento State Hornets on Wednesday, Oct. 18 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

However, neither side could break through as by the end of the half neither side had managed to put any offensive pressure on the other. At halftime, both teams had one shot, zero saves, and only one corner kick from UCSB.</p>\n<p>The teams were able to find their rhythm in the second half of the match with each side getting five shots off. UCSB was able to get four corner kicks as part of their efforts in making junior CSUN goalkeeper Henrik Regitnig work in the second half, forcing him to make four saves. Despite the chances on offense to score, UCSB could not put the ball in the net and the match ended at a regulation time in a draw bringing on overtime.</p>\n<p>CSUN was able to put together chances of their own in the first overtime period with three shots, which were unable to get past Gaucho keeper Alan Carrillo. Carrillo and the UCSB defense held strong in the first overtime period and were able to keep the team in the game long enough to find a chance for the team to score.</p>\n<p>That opportunity came in the second half of overtime in the 106th minute, where Gaucho freshman Rodney Michael got through two Matador defenders and played the ball to sophomore Noah Billingsley, who was able to put the ball past the CSUN keeper Regitnig from the right side of the box.</p>\n<p>The shot was good for the golden goal earning the Gauchos the win, 1-0 in 2OT, increasing their win streak to five. The UCSB defense also continued their shutout streak at the end of this game, bringing their total shutouts for the season to five. The Gauchos ended Thursday night with an overall record of 5-4-2, and 3-0 in conference play.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos then went south to play the University of California, Irvine Anteaters, at Anteater Stadium, Saturday night. Headed into the match, UCI had an overall record of 6-4-2 and 1-1-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>The second North-South division matchup of the trip began with an explosion of offense from both sides. Neither side was able to put a point on the board until the 28th minute where senior Anteater Giovanni Godoy drew a foul in the penalty box bringing senior teammate Mario Ortiz to the penalty spot.</p>\n<p>Ortiz was able to put the ball past UCSB keeper Alan Carrillo, giving the senior his third goal of the season. The offense from both sides continued as 18 shots were taken between the two teams by the end of the first half, but surprisingly it was only Ortiz’s shot which was on the board, giving UCI the lead at 1-0.</p>\n<p>UCI found themselves in their own end as UCSB was able to take possession and create some chances for good shots on goal. The Anteater defense was forced to try to stop the Gauchos as they took their own turn on the offensive end in a second half that would see nine shots taken by the away team.</p>\n<p>UCI was able to take six shots of their own in the second half and did have an opportunity to increase their lead, but Gaucho keeper Carrillo kept them out of the net earning four saves.</p>\n<p>It was in the 83rd minute where UCSB would finally get the finishing chance they needed to execute on when junior forward Jonah Adomakoh played the ball along the right wing to freshman standout Rodney Michael who sent the shot into the net for his fifth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>The match would slowly wind down, ending in regulation at 1-1, and the Gauchos would find themselves in another OT period.</p>\n<p>The first OT period found the Anteaters with yet another helping of steady offensive play. Their closest chance came in the 95th minute on a header that went off the far post and was unable to be put away by any Anteater.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s defense was able to hold steady throughout both overtime periods, not allowing a successful offensive outburst in the first and keeping the Anteater offense quiet in the second.</p>\n<p>The Gaucho offense found nothing in the OT periods and could not put ahead a second golden goal after staving off a valiant UCI offense. The match would be played to a draw at 1-1 at the end of 2OT.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos played well this week in their first instances of conference road play. Earning the exciting win against CSUN and getting a draw against UC Irvine are good signs for a heavily-favored squad which is looking to get ahead early.</p>\n<p>The next match for the Gauchos will be played at Aggie Stadium as UCSB will be taking on the UC Davis Aggies on Wednesday, October 11.</p>\n<p>The next home game for the Gauchos is a surely anticipated match in the 2017 men’s soccer installment of the Blue-Green Rivalry against the Cal Poly Mustangs, which will be played at 7 PM PST on Saturday, October 14th at Harder Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79045\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79045\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-08/chos-5-game-win-streak-ends-with-1-1-tie-at-uc-irvine/","id":1497,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1496,1495,1494],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Men’s Soccer Continues Strong Offensive Showing Against Winless Highlanders","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer_UCSBCalPoly_KennethSong-10-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoccer_UCSBCalPoly_KennethSong-10-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB improves to 2-0 in conference play after defeating winless UC Riverside 3-1 at home.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Gauchos kicked off their Big West matchup against UC Riverside late Saturday night with the offensive-minded approach they showcased in their first conference game of the year against Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>With that mindset, Santa Barbara was able to outlast the Highlanders 3-1 to improve to 4-4-2 overall, and now 2-0 in conference play sitting atop the standings with six points.

Liua was able to perfectly send the ball over the keeper’s head and into the corner of the net to leave the game all tied up at halftime.</p>\n<p>The beginning of the second half did not bring an end to UCSB being able to find ways through the Highlander’s defense and it was Gaucho sophomore Noah Billingsley who put UCSB out in front. The forward took a shot from the left side of the box and floated the ball over the keeper’s head and into the right corner of the net.</p>\n<p>UCR stayed in the game and would occasionally get through the UCSB defense, but the Highlanders were unable to find a way into the net throughout the second half and any shot on goal was either saved or cleared away. The Highlanders were more often finding themselves in their own end trying to prevent the game from getting too ahead of them.</p>\n<p>The defense for the Highlanders finally lapsed in the final five minutes of the game, allowing Gaucho forward Rodney Michael to run past two defenders into the right side of the box and sending a shot past the goalkeeper that was buried into the left corner of the net, allowing the game to end in a 3-1 UCSB victory.</p>\n<p>UCSB players Rodney Michael, Ignacio Tellechea, and Alex Liua continue to work well in the offense through making the correct passes and being able to finish the opportunities presented in front of the net, a great sign for a team looking to establish itself early on in the season.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos next game is Thursday, October 5 at the Cal State Northridge where the Matadors will be playing the Gauchos at 7 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78955\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78955\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-01/mens-soccer-continues-strong-offensive-showing-against-winless-highlanders/","id":1399,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1398,1397,1396],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Season Review: UCSB Women’s Tennis Repeats as Big West Champs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-7-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-7-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Despite early season struggles, the UCSB women's tennis team made a few changes midway through the year which helped it get its groove back en route to its second straight Big West championship.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The remarkable run of the UCSB’s women’s tennis team officially has come to an end, leaving behind another successful season for the Gauchos.

Santa Barbara then went on a tear through the Big West Conference, stringing together wins against opponents like Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State and Cal Poly. Of the seven regular-season conference games they played in April, the Gauchos swept their opponents 4-0 a total of four times.</p>\n<p>The impressive run of seven-straight victories carried Santa Barbara to the No. 2 seed in the Big West Conference Tournament, while three more wins to extend its streak to 10 matches led to an eventual return to the Big West Championships, during which the team played Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Hawaii was responsible for the Gauchos’ sole blemish in their conference record, and the matchup between the two teams was extremely competitive. However, it was UCSB who was able to answer back against the Rainbow Wahine by winning the conference final match 4-1. The finish at the top of the Big West Conference punched the team’s ticket to the first round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Results of the NCAA selection chose UCSB to face the No. 47 UCLA Bruins. The Bruins were a familiar opponent for the Gauchos, who had played them during their non-conference schedule. The Bruins were able to win that match 4-0, clinching the doubles point and leaving three singles matches unfinished.</p>\n<p>The first-round meet between the two teams began with doubles play against the talented Bruin duo of freshman Ena Shibahara and junior Kristin Wiley. UCLA captured the doubles point after a loss by UCSB tandem junior Amanda Atanasson and senior Melissa Baker.</p>\n<p>In singles play, junior Palina Dubavets and senior Stefani Stojic tried to give the Gauchos an early leg up on the Bruins, but the play of No. 5 Shibahara and sophomore Alaina Miller was too much for the Gauchos’ standouts. Junior Terri Fleming clinched the meet for the Bruins after defeating Natalie Da Silveira. Yet again, it was the Bruins winning the match 4-0, clinching the doubles point and leaving three singles matches unfinished.</p>\n<p>Despite the early exit for the Gauchos, the team is still poised to be a contender in both the Big West and the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>The key players the Gauchos will be losing after this season are seniors Melissa Baker, Jaimee Gilbertson and Stefani Stojic. All three of these players were crucial to both UCSB Big West Championship titles and were key players in getting the team out of its regular-season slump this year.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos end this season with a variety of accolades. The team has captured the first back-to-back conference titles since 1995 and 1996, which signaled the end years of UCSB’s six-straight Big West titles from 1991-96. The consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances were also the program’s first since then.</p>\n<p>It certainly was an exciting season to follow, as the women’s tennis program is taking steps toward returning to its glory of being one of the top-tier Big West teams.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Atanasson and Baker were key players in the Gauchos’ impressive run to get into the tournament, but the two were unable to come together in doubles play. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The match on court one between UCLA’s No. 32 redshirt freshman Jada Hart and junior Terri Fleming and the classic pair of No. 66 junior Palina Dubavets and senior Stefani Stojic was left unfinished after the clinching victory by Andrews and Miller on court two. With the Bruins capturing the early lead 1-0, the meet continued on to singles play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginning singles play were two extremely talented players who have been crucial to their respective teams all season, UCLA’s No. 5 Shibahara and UCSB’s Dubavets. The two standouts battled heavily throughout the match, keeping a close score with every set. </span></p>\n<p>However, it was Shibahara who was able to keep Dubavets away and earned the victory in two sets 6-3, 6-4. Up next was Stojic’s turn to try to turn it around for the Gauchos in her match against Miller. Stojic was able to win the first set 6-3, but Miller was able to complete the comeback as she went on to win the next two sets 6-3, 6-2.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Da Silveira continued the Gauchos’ fighting spirit and played an extremely tough first set against her opponent, junior Terri Fleming. Fleming was able to win the first set 7-6 and Da Silveira was unable to come back as she lost the second set 6-2. Like the previous battle between UCLA and UCSB, the meet finished in a 4-0 Bruin victory with three singles matches left unfinished. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos’ loss does not come from a lack of effort or will to win. The team was simply unable to come out on top after pushing the matches to the brink. The loss of several close matches came one after another, and UCLA was successfully able to prevent the Gauchos from establishing a rhythm and attempting a comeback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key Gauchos on the team such as Dubavets, Stojic and Atanasson were unable to step up and, despite the valiant effort, do have to feel disappointed with exiting the tournament so early. </span></p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team’s season ends with an overall record of 17-10; a perfect April and 10-game winning streak helped the team finish with the second seed in the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos went on to win the Big West Championship, their second consecutive title and reached the first round of the NCAA tournament. The end of the Gauchos’ season brings the graduation of seniors Baker, Jaimee Gilbertson oxford, and Stojic.

Stojic was named to the doubles first team for her work as one half of the Dubavets/Stojic pair, and Baker was named to the doubles second team for her partnership with Dubavets as well. It is these players who the Gauchos are hoping will push the team to new heights in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>“We have seven of the eight players returning from last year’s team, and everyone has seemed to gain experience and play better,” Thibodeau said. “We have a similar team, but with more experience, and now we’re playing a team that we know at a site closer to home, which has us feeling good about the match.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team will play the No. 23 UCLA Bruins on Friday, May 12, at 10 a.m. If UCSB advances, it will face either Pepperdine or LIU Brooklyn on Saturday, May 13 at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 4, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/rallying-gauchos-prepare-for-bruins-to-open-postseason/","id":1202,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1201,1200,1199],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Returning the Favor: The Reintroduction of UCSB Women’s Tennis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-10.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017.04.22_StephenManga_WTennis-10.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After winning its first NCAA Tournament match in program history last season, the UCSB women's tennis team entered its 2016-17 campaign even more determined to continue the ascension of the Gauchos re...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>At the end of March, the UCSB women’s tennis team had an overall record of 7-9.

The Gauchos played an exciting match, with the clinching point coming from a singles victory by freshman Stephanie Yamada.</p>\n<p>The final victory in the month of April allowed the Gauchos to yet again raise the cup, a satisfaction surely made sweeter by beating the team that had been above them so often during the season. The Championship win also meant a perfect April for the UCSB women’s tennis team, as the team won all 10 games played, and they will surely carry that momentum into the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis program has not always experienced this kind of success. Last year’s Big West Championship became the program’s first in 20 years. The team had fallen into mediocrity after winning the Big West Championship six consecutive years from 1991-1996.</p>\n<p>The work toward obtaining the accolades UCSB has earned over the past couple of seasons can be traced back to five years ago, when longtime Fresno State Head Coach Simon Thibodeau was brought to Santa Barbara to lead the program.</p>\n<p>“Well, it was difficult to leave Fresno State, where we had a lot of success, and I was really trying to bring UCSB to the same level. I felt the school had even more potential due to the location and academic rank of this school,” Thibodeau said.</p>\n<p>For the first three seasons of Thibodeau’s career, the team went 39-34, during which it was bounced out of the tournament every single season; the conference final was its highest mark yet.</p>\n<p>However, it was in this period of time when Thibodeau began to recruit players who would grow to be important pieces of the current winning formula at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Melissa Baker and Jaimee Gilbertson were added in 2013 and Natalie Da Silveira became a Gaucho in 2014. The 2015 additions to the squad included Amanda Atanasson, Palina Dubavets, Stefani Stojic and Yamada.</p>\n<p>“We also had a donor who boosted our scholarship amount, so we were able to go get a few more players like Palina, Amanda and Stefani Stojic, who are all transfers, and we gained some budget in their scholarship, so I was able to get more top players and I was able to compete at the highest level.”</p>\n<p>All of these players have been critical to UCSB’s rise to the top of the Big West Conference, and Thibodeau credits an increase in funding from UCSB donors as the primary reason the women’s tennis program is able to acquire highly talented transfers such as Dubavets and Stojic.</p>\n<p>“We really try to make this program the full package for any prospect in the world that wants to go study in the U.S. and play tennis. We’re getting closer; we would like to build more facilities in the future, but that’s the next step in terms of fundraising.”</p>\n<p>The current tennis roster boasts seven international players out of the current 12 roster spots, a sign of the increased ability of the program to attract better prospects.</p>\n<p>“Most of the best teams in the tournament are all fully funded in their scholarships.

In addition to benefitting from having five returners from the 2015-16 team, Santa Barbara is a more enticing team to keep an eye on entering the tournament, as it carries a seven-match winning streak into the postseason.</p>\n<p>However, for Cal Poly, the outlook coming into the tournament has been a bit less optimistic. The team barely missed out on having to play this Thursday in the first round in which the No. 8 and 9 seeds face off. Yet, even if the Mustangs had won, they would have been forced to face the unbeaten No. 1 Hawaii Rainbow Wahine.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Mustangs get a second look at the Gauchos in the quarterfinals and hope to perform better the second time around.</p>\n<p>In order to perform better against UCSB, Cal Poly has to make an effort to get ahead early, be it in doubles play or in the first matches of singles play. The Gauchos were simply able to dominate the Mustangs, carrying the momentum from winning the doubles point in singles play during which only one Mustang, junior Molly Reed, picked up a victory in singles play.</p>\n<p>Stopping the Gauchos before they are able to get on a run looks to be the only way Cal Poly will be able to come out on top or at least thoroughly challenge UCSB.</p>\n<p>Should Santa Barbara get past the Mustangs, waiting in the second round could potentially be either No. 3 Long Beach State or No. 6 UC Davis. A good sign for the Gauchos in these potential matchups is that the team defeated both teams during the regular season. The Aggies also suffered a loss in the quarterfinals of last year’s tournament to UCSB, 4-0.</p>\n<p>A potential matchup against the Beach in this year’s tournament could be one of the most exciting.</p>\n<p>Long Beach State possesses a long and storied history in the Big West Championships, having been crowned champions an impressive 12 times since 2002.</p>\n<p>The UCSB women’s tennis team’s first match in the Big West Conference Championships is against the Cal Poly Mustangs on Friday, April 28, at 9 a.m. The championships run until Sunday, April 30, on which the championship match will be played at 9 a.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 20, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/gauchos-thriving-off-current-7-match-win-streak-hold-no-2-seed-in-big-west-tournament/","id":1197,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1196,1195,1194],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Tennis Wins Final Seven Games of Regular Season After Defeating Cal Poly 4-1 in Finale","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-04-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-26-at-12.49.57-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-26-at-12.49.57-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In the final match of the regular season, the No. 48 UCSB women’s tennis team was able to beat the rival Cal Poly Mustangs at home by a final score of 4-1.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In the final match of the regular season, the No. 48 UCSB women’s tennis team was able to beat the rival Cal Poly Mustangs at home by a final score of 4-1.</p>\n<p>The meet began with doubles play, during which UCSB was able to quickly take the doubles point in two straight sets, despite not fielding any of the three ranked pairs the Gauchos currently have according to the latest ITA rankings.

With Cal Poly getting its first points on the board, the meet was at 2-1 in favor of the Gauchos, but the UCSB women’s tennis team was able to regroup and run away with the rest of the meet.</p>\n<p>With Cal Poly getting its first points on the board, the meet was at 2-1 in favor of the Gauchos, but the UCSB women’s tennis team was able to regroup and run away with the rest of the meet.</p>\n<p>The team went on to win the final two matches needed to clinch the victory in consecutive fashion as freshman Jaimee Gilbertson defeated Saltzen 6-4, 6-2. Gilbertson’s win over Saltzen increased her already team-leading record of 17 singles match victories to 18.</p>\n<p>Baker delivered the final blow to Cal Poly after defeating senior Sayaka Tsugai 6-3, 6-1, and the Gauchos officially became the winners of the women’s tennis Blue-Green rivalry three years in a row.</p>\n<p>Both Da Silveira and Baker were participants in last year’s Blue-Green rivalry, and it was good to see both players make significant contributions to this year’s rivalry in the form of picking up a victory in doubles and singles play.</p>\n<p>The win over Cal Poly marked the seventh-straight victory for the Gauchos, a streak that began on April 2 with a 4-1 win over Cal State Northridge. The seven-straight victories are the primary reason the Gauchos are where they are in the conference currently.</p>\n<p>During the seven-game streak, the team was able to beat six conference opponents, which allowed for the Gauchos to improve on the 1-1 record they had before the month of April.</p>\n<p>Their play on this hot streak has resembled the play of last season when the team won the Big West Championships, and they are hoping to carry their current momentum into the tournament to win the title two seasons in a row.</p>\n<p>In order to have the right to share the Big West Conference title, the Gauchos needed to get a win over the Cal Poly Mustangs and a loss by Hawaii to Cal State Fullerton.</p>\n<p>Although UCSB won its match this weekend, the Rainbow Warriors were able to get by a tough Titan team, winning their match 4-0. The Gauchos will enter the tournament at the No. 2 seed without the Big West title they won just a year ago.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Gauchos will travel to Indian Wells to kick off the Big West Championships, playing their first game on Friday, April 28, with a time and opponent yet to be announced.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77302\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77302\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-24/womens-tennis-wins-final-seven-games-of-regular-season-after-defeating-cal-poly-4-1-in-finale/","id":45,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[44,43,42],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Seek to Beat Rival Cal Poly to Maintain 7-Match Win Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WomensTennis_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-11-17_3-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WomensTennis_ChristinaDeMarzo_2-11-17_3-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Rising within the Big West standings, the UCSB women's tennis team carries its seven-match win streak into the traditional Blue-Green rivalry.

In the match, Cal Poly was able to clinch the doubles point and the match victory overall, despite taking three consecutive singles matches late in the meet. The close victory came for the Mustangs after suffering a deflating 4-0 loss to the Long Beach State 49ers during which no Mustang won a match, singles or doubles.</p>\n<p>The solid performance against Riverside may not be too good of an indicator of level of play for UCSB, as Cal Poly has been unable to perform well against the other top teams in the conference such as Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>Coming off of a weekend during which the Gauchos beat those two exact teams, the comparison between UCSB and Cal Poly in this match clearly favors the Gauchos winning the meet again. However, the Mustangs may be motivated to play well, as this is the final regular season chance for bragging rights in the rivalry.</p>\n<p>Players who are currently on a hot streak for the Gauchos are Palina Dubavets, Natalie Da Silveira and Amanda Atanasson. These players have been playing exceptionally well in the month of April, as Dubavets won all of her matches, both singles and doubles, in her last two matches against top competition. Da Silveira won all of her singles matches and one of her doubles matches against the same opponents. Atanasson was able to come back in last weekend’s meet against Long Beach State after losing the doubles match to begin the day.</p>\n<p>In the case of Dubavets, she was recently awarded her second Big West Women’s Tennis Athlete of the Week after defeating Long Beach State’s Maeva Razakasoa — a two-time Big West Player of the Year — in singles last week, helping UCSB take the victory over LBSU 4-2.</p>\n<p>No win comes easy for any team, especially in a rivalry match like this one. The Blue-Green rivalry spans between all sports, and with all that’s on the line for the Gauchos, chances are they won’t be taking things easy come Saturday.</p>\n<p>UCSB takes on Cal Poly at 10 a.m. on Saturday, April 22 in Santa Barbara at the Rec Cen courts.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the April 20, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"></div>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The meet began with doubles play in which the team of junior Amanda Atanasson and freshman Amit Lev Ari beat the UCR pair of freshman Sara Khattab and junior Natalie Penner 6-2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing the clinching doubles points were junior Palina Dubavets and senior Melissa Baker who won their set 6-1 against juniors Karla Dulay and Tamilla Vaksman. The doubles play from UCSB has been outstanding as of late and has been one of the reasons the team has been so successful. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was junior Amanda Atanasson who began the singles play action with a win against UCR freshman Lauren Wolfe 6-0, 6-0. Sophomore Stephanie Yamada was the next Gaucho to win in singles play during the meet, going 6-1, 6-0 against Vaksman. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winning what would be the final match of the meet was Lev Ari who beat her doubles opponent, Penner, with a score of 6-2, 6-0. The remaining three matches featuring Dubavets, Gaucho junior Natalie Da Silveira, and Gaucho senior Jaimee Gilbertson were left to go unfinished, and the Gauchos won the match 4-0. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB then traveled to Long Beach State for a Saturday meet with the No. 2 Big West team. The 49ers stared fate in the face, as the meet’s outcome would make or break their standing over No. 3 UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doubles play began with a slow start for UCSB as 49er freshmen Maren Helgo and Natalia Munoz defeated Yamada and Da Silveira 6-3. Long Beach junior Lena Pacholski and senior Laura Eales defeated senior Stefani Stojic and Atanasson 6-4 to give Long Beach State the doubles point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gauchos were left to try to rally. Beginning singles play with a victory for UCSB was Stojic, who won her first match of the weekend against freshman Helgo 6-4, 6-2. Atanasson continued the rally, picking up a victory against Munoz 6-0, 6-4. In what would be the third and final consecutive singles victory for the Gauchos, sophomore Yamada beat LBSU’s Eales 6-4, 7-5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In what would be the third and final consecutive singles victory for the Gauchos, sophomore Yamada beat LBSU’s Eales 6-4, 7-5. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putting a stop to the UCSB streak was Pacholski, who won her game against Gilbertson, 6-3, 2-6, 6-2. The opportunity to clinch the winning point and end the match fell on the shoulders of Dubavets, who has been a standout for the Gauchos all season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a back-and-forth match between Dubavets and senior Maeva Razakasoa as the two each traded the first two sets.

Natalie Da Silveira and Stephanie Yamada then beat Titan pair Masako Makiba and Danielle Pham, 6-2.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The senior star tandem of Alexis Valenzuela and Camille De Leon clinched the doubles point for the Titans against the #46 pair Melissa Baker and Palina Dubavets. This win gave Valenzuela and De Leon their 10th consecutive doubles win and a 13-1 record for the season. The doubles work of the Titans has been extremely successful and they have earned 16 doubles wins on the season.</p>\n<p>However, the Gauchos were able to storm back in singles play. Beginning the rally was senior Jaimee Gilbertson who defeated her opponent Karla Portalatin 6-3, 6-4. Stojic  and Atanasson defeated their opponents Nuno and Makiba at a score of 6-3, 6-3, and 6-3, 6-4. Winning the final completed match for the Gauchos was Melissa Baker who was able to beat Titan junior Danielle Pham 6-1, 5-7, 6-0. The rest of the matches were left unfinished and Santa Barbara began their weekend with a decisive victory over Cal State Fullerton, 4-1.</p>\n<p>Sunday brought the Anteaters to UCSB where the meet began with doubles play. The No. 46 team of Melissa Baker and Palina Dubavets got the Gauchos ahead early by winning the first game of the meet 6-1.</p>\n<p>The Anteaters responded back with a win of their own as Hali Dickson and Vivien Dvali beat the Gaucho pair of Amanda Atanasson and Stefani Stojic, 5-2. Clinching the doubles point for UCSB was the pair of Natalie Da Silveira and Stephanie Yamada who beat Cassidy Branstine and Ashlynn Hall, 6-1.</p>\n<p>Like they did the game before, UCSB stormed to win four consecutive games in singles play. Natalie Da Silveira earned the first singles win of the day 6-3, 6-1 over Vivien Dvali. Jaimee Gilbertson continued her winning ways against Anteater senior Cassidy Branstine 6-1, 6-2. Amanda Atanasson beat Ashlynn Hall 6-2, and capping off the meet was Melissa Baker who beat UCI freshman Jacqueline Tsodikova 6-1, 6-1.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos accomplished everything they wanted to this weekend, coming away with two victories over conference opponents and doing it in dominating fashion. The team is now 4-1 in conference play and has improved to third place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>The great performance against Cal State Fullerton is a great indicator of where UCSB is playing at currently in the season, a level of play the Gauchos will need to sustain if they want to climb the standings against Long Beach State in two weeks.</p>\n<p>The ability of the UCSB women’s tennis squad to continue their great play into the next meet against UC Irvine is exactly what the Gauchos need to be doing in order to stay ahead of the pack by beating the lower teams in the division.</p>\n<p>Wherever UCSB finishes after the end of the regular season, their performance and level of play must be high if UCSB wants to create a sequel to the very successful season the program had the year prior, where the team won the Big West Conference Championship and got to the second round of the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>Join the Gauchos as they begin their final road trip of the regular season in which they will play at UC Riverside on Friday, April 14 and at Long Beach State on Saturday, April 15.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76830\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/ucsb-tallies-its-fourth-consecutive-win-sweeps-weekend-matchups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76830\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/ucsb-tallies-its-fourth-consecutive-win-sweeps-weekend-matchups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/ucsb-tallies-its-fourth-consecutive-win-sweeps-weekend-matchups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/ucsb-tallies-its-fourth-consecutive-win-sweeps-weekend-matchups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-10/ucsb-tallies-its-fourth-consecutive-win-sweeps-weekend-matchups/","id":1170,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1169,1168,1167],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Tennis Aims to Notch 2nd Big West Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-05-at-9.20.41-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-05-at-9.20.41-PM.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Having won two straight, including their conference opener, the Gauchos will look to ride the hot streak when they face Big West foes CSUF and UCI this weekend on the road.

The lone loss for the Titans came against conference opponents Long Beach State, who is currently one spot ahead of Cal State Fullerton at the No. 2 spot in the conference. The impressive play for Fullerton this season seems to have been the result of consistency.</p>\n<p>The Titans have been able to clinch the doubles point 14 times this season and have not dropped a doubles point in all of 2017. The doubles play success is made possible with the excellent play of the tandem seniors Camille De Leon and Alexis Valenzuela.</p>\n<p>De Leon and Valenzuela have also been able to be a steady force for the Titans in singles play, as both players have a combined singles record of 22-3. The success of these players in both singles and doubles play has been critical to the Titans having their best record through 15 games played in the program’s history.</p>\n<p>The impressive play from the Titans could pose a problem for the Gauchos, who have the opportunity to improve their conference record to 4-1, which would place the Gauchos in the top three teams in the conference.</p>\n<p>UCSB will look to respond to Fullerton’s talented doubles teams with their own impressive tandems in senior Stefani Stojic and junior Amanda Atanasson as well as the pair of junior Palina Dubavets and senior Melissa Baker.</p>\n<p>Ever since the pairing of these teams, the Gauchos have performed well in doubles play, earning the doubles point yet again in their latest match against Loyola Marymount University.</p>\n<p>While Cal State Fullerton has had a successful season thus far, the UC Irvine Anteaters have not shared the same success.</p>\n<p>UC Irvine currently sits at seventh in the conference with a 3-13 overall and 0-3 conference record. The Anteaters are currently on a three-game losing streak and are continuing their conference play after dropping a game last weekend to UC Davis, 4-2.</p>\n<p>So far in the season, UC Irvine is 48-87 in singles play and 22-41 in doubles play. Only one player has an above .500 record for the Anteaters in singles play and only one team has an above .500 record in doubles play.</p>\n<p>It’s been a tough season for the Anteaters, and they would have to play well in nearly all of their games, coupled with some poor performances from the top teams, in order to climb the Big West Conference standings. UC Irvine is one of three teams who has yet to win a conference match.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play the Cal State Fullerton Titans at home on Saturday, April 8, at 11 a.m. The Gauchos will play again the following day on April 9 against UC Irvine at 11 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76663\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/womens-tennis-aims-to-notch-2nd-big-west-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76663\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/womens-tennis-aims-to-notch-2nd-big-west-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/womens-tennis-aims-to-notch-2nd-big-west-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/womens-tennis-aims-to-notch-2nd-big-west-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/womens-tennis-aims-to-notch-2nd-big-west-win/","id":1169,"author":{"id":284,"name":"Andrew Hernandez"},"related":[1168,1167,1166],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":4,"route":"/authors/284"}},"__N_SSG":true}
