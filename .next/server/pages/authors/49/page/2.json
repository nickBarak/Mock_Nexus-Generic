Community Service District (I.V. CSD), hires houseless people and pays them $15 an hour for various cleaning and landscaping tasks, according to Emily Allen, the United Way nonprofit’s director of Homeless and Veterans Impact Initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I was homeless, they hired me for this, now I’m not homeless,” Moomey said. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said he works around 20 hours a week, responding to the numerous service requests by users of the SeeClickFix app, which can range from graffiti cleanup and cutting overgrown weeds to removing Lime scooters on sidewalks. Anyone can download the SeeClickFix app, take photos of a nuisance in Isla Vista and someone — possibly Moomey — will fix the problem.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since working as the local beautification specialist, Moomey said that he has seen a tangible change in the community, in part from the work he has done so far. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know a lot of the homeless individuals here. Well, I guess I inspired them; they see what I’m doing picking up trash, doing landscaping stuff. They’ve been cleaning stuff up themselves,” Moomey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey also plans to work with landscaping architect Lynn Kirby on the new Isla Vista Community Center, and he said they are currently deciding on how to landscape the area surrounding the building. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD began using SeeClickFix in April 2019 as part of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/csd-launches-community-beautification-app-plans-to-employ-houseless-community-members/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pilot program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with United Way. Moomey was one of the original employees and was “critical in getting the project started in Isla Vista,” Allen said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United Way originally hired Moomey and one other employee for the program’s launch, but the other person moved to live with family on the East Coast, according to Christina Lydick, former beautification manager for SeeClickFix Isla Vista. For a few months, Moomey was the only beautification specialist in the program and responded to most of the service requests, according to Allen. United Way hired two new houseless community members in November 2019, and they started work this January.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the living wage in Santa Barbara County is $16.50 an hour for a working adult with no children, according to the </span><a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06083\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIT Living Wage Calculator</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the minimum wage in the county is $12 an hour for businesses with less than 26 employees and $13 an hour for businesses that employ 26 or more employees. Allen said that although the program is intended as a work experience project, the positions still pay above the minimum wage — $15 — due to the high cost of living. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the pilot program began in April 2019, I.V. Beautiful has completed at least 246 service requests, mostly regarding graffiti abatement, according to Allen. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The city of Santa Barbara is finalizing a partnership with United Way to develop a program based on I.V. Beautiful, according to Allen, who added that she aims to begin the program in late February.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moomey said that he is a part of the talks between the city of Santa Barbara and United Way and that he may work in the downtown area as part of the program.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve been asked to do 20 hours a week in Santa Barbara and continue doing 20 hours a week out here,” Moomey said. “I’m going to love it.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><em>A

Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299 were present at Wednesday’s UC Santa Barbara strike. The workers set up their base at Storke Tower but spent much of the day marching around campus in order to draw attention to the union’s demands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AFSCME 3299 — which represents more than 24,000 health care and service employees across the UC system — has been embroiled in contract negotiations with the university for the past two years, and one of its primary demands has been an end to outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This strike was AFSCME 3299’s sixth at UC campuses across the state in the past two years — a point of frustration among many of the workers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Colvin, a custodian at UCSB and an AFSCME 3299 member, said that he was “disappointed” with the number of strikes but added that he felt the only way the university will change its behavior is if the union keeps striking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that we’re out here again on unfair labor practices has me a little disappointed about making and impact on the way they follow the rules, but I think the only way that we’re ever going to make a change on that is by keep coming out,” Colvin said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paco Garcia, a senior lead laborer in facilities management at UCSB and an AFSCME member, added that union workers “don’t make the cost of living.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They don’t make enough money to live in Santa Barbara, they don’t make enough to go on with their lives, they have to take two jobs,” Garcia said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Outsourcing is causing people to not have a steady job; it’s causing people to not live at the cost of living, and we want the university to stop breaking the law,” Garcia added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents is currently considering a motion that — with a few exceptions — would prohibit outsourcing and adopt contracted workers to the UC’s payroll if they have been working for the UC for over a year.

AFSCME uses strikes as a bargaining tool, he added — the strike forces the university to hire more people to replace the strikers, which in turn provides the UC incentive to listen to the union’s demand that they end illegal outsourcing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite AFSCME’s insistence that the strikes are about the illegal outsourcing complaints, UC Office of the President spokesperson Andrew Gordon called the strike a strategy to gain “leverage in negotiations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gordon added that the union ultimately wants double the wages of other employees and said AFSCME 3299 utilizes the strikes as a mechanism to achieve that goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Despite union concerns about contracting, the number of AFSCME-represented employees has actually grown by double digits in the past five years,” Gordon said. “UC’s contracts with AFSCME protect employees from displacement due to contracting, and no employee can be terminated as a result of a subcontracting decision.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strike saw a degree of student solidarity, such as from Wendy Santamaria, a fourth-year political science and philosophy major, who attended the strike alongside her fellow Students for Bernie organization members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I see it as absolutely crucial for us as students to come together with workers,” Santamaria said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As long as we keep spreading knowledge of the issues workers are facing, [support for the strike] is going to continue to grow,” she added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the student support, external groups such as hip-hop duo Rebel Diaz, a Chicago-based group that was on campus Wednesday to </span><a href=\"https://z-m-www.facebook.com/events/990558504623313/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">perform</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at a separate event, marched through campus with the strikers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know that the struggles they’re fighting for are not just about wages but about this idea of an entire system becoming privatized and the outsourcing of jobs and services that should be publicly funded,” said Rodrigo “RodStarz” Venegas, who is half of Rebel Diaz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzalez emphasized that “we all want the same thing.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We all want to make sure that we have a job tomorrow,” she added.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Nov. 14, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Sweeney said that it is highly unlikely that union members would reject the contract, but if they did, the union would need to re-negotiate a contract with the UC. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeney added that the contract will increase researchers’ job security by extending appointment times to at least a year for each researcher. Before the contract, researchers could receive appointments lasting as short as a month, reducing their ability to plan projects effectively, according to Sweeney.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC agreed to “longer term appointments, equity and salary scale smoothing adjustments for those lower on the salary scales, [and] strict merit review deadlines” Holbrook said in an email.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our goal was a multi-year agreement that recognizes the significant contributions academic researchers make to UC’s academic mission, and that’s what we’ve achieved,” said Peter Chester, the UC’s executive director of labor relations, in a press release.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the UC now requires “just cause” in order to terminate a researcher in the middle of their appointment, according to Sweeney, meaning that the UC must provide warnings and a fair investigation of a researcher’s conduct before firing a researcher. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union was unable to secure comprehensive paid parental leave during the negotiations, but now employees may accrue sick and vacation days in order to use them consecutively as a substitution for parental leave, according to Sweeney. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Before this contract, you were only able to use those sick days in very limited ways. It had to be either you were sick or a family member was sick. Under the [new] contract, you can use them to take care of a baby,” Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Paid parental leave increases employee satisfaction, increases retention of women at the university, increases productivity. The costs of it are basically negligible because people end up staying longer. We think it’s really a win-win to expand this.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a joint committee between the union and the university will explore options to fund paid parental leave and create bridge funding, according to Holbrook. Bridge funding is a form of financing meant to cover immediate, short-term concerns until a method for longer-term funding is found. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While ARU and UAW 5810 settled their contracts relatively amicably with the university, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299, which represents UC health care and service workers, is striking and will hold a walkout on Nov. 13 due to allegations of violations of state labor laws.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People form[ed] a union because they felt that, as researchers, they could do better work if they had more workplace protections,” Sweeney said. “Better working conditions leads to better research.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-91010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-91010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-04/academic-researchers-united-uc-announce-tentative-two-year-contract/","id":1943,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1942,1941,1940],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Looking To Sell Your ID Card?

However, the office does keep copies of the allegations on file, even if the student isn’t punished following a first infraction, according to the warning emails sent to students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve never tried to get an ID in the past, but I’m on Free and For Sale and I see the posts all the time and I know it’s a common thing people do,” said a fourth-year anthropology major, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The student posted on the Free and For Sale page looking for an extra ID so their younger sister, who is not a UCSB student, could attend Delirium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After posting on the Facebook page, a warning email from the Office of Student Conduct appeared in the student’s inbox. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I didn’t even think about it being an issue because everyone’s been doing it for so long. It’s something that I see around this time of year every single year, for all the concerts,” the student added. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB does not go through the Free &amp; For Sale page looking for offenders, according to Armistead. Instead, she said the university receives reports and screenshots of student ID sales from other individuals, often students, who use the page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people who run the Facebook group used to take down and report posts about ID sales, but due to the sheer volume of posts, they are simply unable to keep up with all of them, according to the page’s administrator, Dayllan Maar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the university really cares that much about it, they’re more than welcome to look through the page and find everyone who’s violating the rules,” Maar said. “If the university doesn’t view it to be that important of a rule, I don’t know why I should enforce a rule the university doesn’t want to enforce.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University administrators, police officers and members of Associated Students are all members of the Facebook page, meaning that they can see when students make posts about ID sales, according to Maar. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maar said he suspects UCSB is cracking down on the posts now due to the page’s growing user base, which had 20,000 members when he became a moderator in 2017, but has doubled to over 40,000 members in the last two years. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armistead’s assertion that the presence of non-students at student-only events opens the door to safety concerns was backed up by Student Advocate General Andrew Nguyen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is most dangerous is when people outside of Isla Vista and the UCSB community come to Isla Vista and UCSB and they pose a potential danger to our community because they’re not from this community,” Nguyen said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They have no stake in this community, there’s no personal ties. That’s where a lot of reckless behavior happens.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nguyen, whose office assists alleged violators of student conduct policy, added that when students rent their IDs to non-students, they might be held responsible for the behavior of whoever used their ID. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of official security concerns, some students are frustrated with the current policy on who is allowed to attend the concerts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I do understand the concept of doing a UCSB-only concert, but I think if a student doesn’t want to go … if that person wasn’t going to go anyway, then you might as well let someone else go,” the fourth-year added. </span></p><div

rental contracts with tenants, and instead search for new tenants they can rent to more expensively as a way of getting around the new legislation. </span><em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1482\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to be implemented on Jan. 1, 2020, prohibits landlords from raising rents more than 5% when they renew contracts with ongoing tenants. The law will also increase protections for renters; now, landlords must have “just cause” for evicting a tenant who has lived in the property for more than a year, and no-fault evictions will require the landlord to reimburse their tenant for at least one month’s rent.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AB 1482 will fight rent gouging and unjust evictions to help protect millions of Californians who rent the place they call home,” Assemblymember Rob Bonta(D-Oakland), who helped author the bill, said in a press release. Assemblymembers Bonta, Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), Rob Bonta (D-Oakland) and Tim Grayson (D-Concord) also co-authored the bill, while Assemblymember David Chiu (D-San Francisco) is the main author.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) is more skeptical because of the high turnover rate of college renters in Isla Vista compared to long-term tenants in other areas of the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robin Unander, a lawyer who works with the IVTU, said that due to I.V.’s 94.2% occupancy rate, with 98% of occupants being </span><a href=\"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US0636868-isla-vista-ca/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">renters</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, she believes landlords will choose not to renew rental contracts with tenants, and instead search for new tenants they can rent to more expensively as a way of getting around the new legislation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have more people looking for housing than we have housing available right now,” Unander said. “So this law is not going to benefit anybody in Isla Vista, probably not anybody in Santa Barbara.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If [landlords] have a choice between renewing this tenancy at a lower rent increase or do a new tenancy for more money in a community like ours where there is a low vacancy rate, their better investment is going to be to end that existing tenancy and go with a newer tenancy at the higher rent,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander said that renters living in housing owned by St. George &amp; Associates, a leasing company with property in I.V., have approached her with concerns regarding their landlord’s reaction to the new law. According to Unander, St. George &amp; Associates planned to raise rent 12%, on a unit where five tenants live. Due to AB 1482, the leasing company is considering not renewing the lease and instead looking for new tenants they can legally increase the rent on. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">St. George &amp; Associates did not immediately respond to request for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite I.V.’s low vacancy rates and consistent supply of tenants, however, it’s expensive for landlords to replace their tenants with new ones, according to Klinton Gibbons, property manager for The Hive IV, a leasing company based in Isla Vista.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If anything it’s going to benefit people who decide to move somewhere and decide to stay there the three or four years of their school. If they move around all four years, then they’re not going to be locked into any sort of rent control,” Gibbons said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If we were to lose income, we would just make it up from people who don’t renew and raise those rents in order to balance that out,” Gibbons added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gibbons added that it usually costs The Hive IV roughly $1,500 to prepare an apartment for a new tenant, which can be spent on cleaning, painting and replacing broken items in the unit.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many legislators and advocates support rent control, UCSB economist Peter Rupert noted that many economists do not have the same conclusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Pretty much every economist believes that rent control typically works the opposite than what people hope for,” Rupert said, meaning it decreases the supply of housing rather than adding to it. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupert added that California should increase the supply of housing, rather than enact rent control, in order to alleviate the housing crisis.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other landlords operating in I.V., such as Sierra Property Management, are considering charging their tenants for utilities, which some currently do not have to pay, as a direct response to AB 1482, according to its President Michelle Roberson.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for evictions, most in I.V. happen due to tenants falling behind on rent, according to Undander, which could fall under the law’s “just cause” requirement in order for a landlord to send an eviction notice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average rent for an apartment in I.V. is $2,131, according to Rentcafe.com, a rental site which compiles rental market trends. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bill was written with the intention of alleviating California’s homelessness crisis, as evictions can send more people to the street with nowhere else to go, according to Chiu.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our housing crisis is causing instability for renters across our state,” said Wicks in a press release. “AB 1482 provides some much-needed relief, with stronger protections to keep tenants in their homes — by protecting renters from the most egregious of rent increases and unjust evictions.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus </em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday, Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) board members, county officials and I.V. residents gathered at 976 Embarcadero Del Mar to celebrate the new Isla Vista Community Center’s soft opening. The hard opening date has yet to be released, but I.V. CSD board members are hoping to hold an  official opening sometime between January and March to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the February 1970 I.V. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bank burning</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re here celebrating how far we’ve come because it wasn’t that long ago, this building was about to fall over,” said I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no current activities or initiatives are slated for the community center, Brandt said he was interested in using the space to run a variety of programs. Potential ways in which residents may be able to use the space include English classes, homework help for school children, computer literacy classes, yoga classes and a litany of other similar programs, according to Brandt.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD paid the Isla Vista Youth Projects (IVYP) $177,000, using funds obtained by a tax on all I.V. residents’ utilities, to manage the community center for one year, according to Lori Goodman, executive director of IVYP. Goodman added that approximately $150,000 of the money will be used to pay its two full-time staff members, while the rest is for potential programs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The County of Santa Barbara paid for the majority of renovations to the building, spending $1,320,000 to replace the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, build two bathrooms and install a kitchen. About $400,000 of that money came from the county’s general fund, according to Third District Supervisor Joan Hartmann; the rest came from the federal government through Community Development Block Grants, which Hartmann said made the project possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on community feedback, the I.V. CSD is planning additional renovations to the building, including covering the cement ground of the center with hardwood floor. The district is also looking into grants which could further fund renovations, according to Brandt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This space has always been a hub for the community of Isla Vista back when I came here in the 60s,” said I.V. CSD Board Member Father Jon-Stephen Hedges, who used to run his church out of the building.  “One of the reasons our community kind of flailed, is because we didn’t have a community center.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soft opening inspired Carmen Lodise, who lived in Isla Vista for 30 years and was one of the original activists fighting for a community center, to come from his home in Mexico to witness what he had been wanting to see for decades. Lodise is also the author of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s wonderful. It brought tears to my eyes,” Lodise said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Efforts to open the center began in the 1970s, when the building that now houses the Isla Vista Clinic was sold, prompting activists to seek a new space where everyone in the community could congregate, according to Lodise’s book.

CSD (pictured above at a meeting) agreed to do so in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">January</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of this year. </span><em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Survivor Resource Center, located in the center of Isla Vista, provides a location where survivors of sexual assault can go to receive counseling, connections to medical, legal or police services and other services Standing Together to End Sexual Assault (STESA) generally  provides such as confidential counseling. For privacy, individuals can only receive the exact address of the center by calling (805) 564-3696.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center’s beginnings can be traced back to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-04/students-return-to-ucsb-chancellors-office-to-reiterate-demands-for-sexual-violence-reform/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 2017</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, when over 100 students engaged in a nine-hour sit-in at Chancellor Henry T. Yang’s office calling for the university to accept 12 demands meant to reform how the school addresses sexual violence. The first of those demands directed UC Santa Barbara to open a resource center for survivors of sexual assault. UCSB did not end up opening a center, but Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) agreed to do so in </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-i-v-csd-and-stesa-finalize-agreement-for-resource-center-in-i-v/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">January</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of this year after it was approached by Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Community members wanted one place where they knew that they could send people or come on a regular basis as needed,” Elsa Granados, executive director of STESA, said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s 2 in the morning or 2 in the afternoon; we have a counselor available.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center strives to serve the entire I.V. community, not just students, according to Granados.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Often people think that when there are sexual assaults in Isla Vista, [they think] they only [happen to] UCSB students,” said Granados. “UCSB students do experience sexual assault, but there’s a greater community here in Isla Vista that experiences sexual assault. Low income families, monolingual spanish speakers.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the center, STESA, which is based in Santa Barbara city but operates throughout the county, would send advocates wherever a survivor in need was. The new location offers a fixed space that survivors can walk into, rather than making a call, Granados said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STESA will pay exactly one dollar in rent a year to the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD), which is allowing them to use space in a building owned by Santa Barbara County that was previously used for storage and as an office for former Supervisor Doreen Farr before that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD spent roughly $5,000 in the lead-up to the center’s opening, buying furniture and renovating the space, according to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD. The money came from the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">user utility tax granted by Measure R</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which the I.V. CSD didn’t have when they began working with STESA to provide the new center, Abboud added.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our big contribution was acquiring the space and designating it for this purpose, and funding the upgrades needed to get it to be the nice relaxing space it is now,” Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center provides a variety of resources for sexual assault survivors, but STESA’s most commonly used service is a 24-hour hotline that survivors can use to call and connect with an advocate. Other resources include counseling, assistance with filing official reports or direction to medical services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The center intentionally does not maintain a police presence, as some survivors may feel uncomfortable around police officers, according to Granados. Reporting to the police is an option STESA presents to survivors of sexual assault but does not pressure them to follow that course of action, Granados added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Someone might say ‘I don’t want to report to law enforcement, but I am worried about what happened to my body and I’m worried that I might have internal injuries’ and so then we can refer them to a medical clinic,” Granados said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 29 reported rapes to UCSB Police in 2018, according to the 2019 </span><a href=\"https://www.police.ucsb.edu/files/docs/2019_Annual_Security_Report.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clery Act crime report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These numbers do not include reports submitted to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), which also patrols I.V. However, in </span><a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv16.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a report which found that 80% of rapes and sexual assaults are not reported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The police often refer survivors to STESA, and according to University of California Police Department Detective Alexis Dougherty, the new center will provide a location where police can meet with survivors in a more comfortable location.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This center is fantastic because it will allow us to see different survivors in this community,” Dougherty said. “It’s not just UCSB students in Isla Vista; we’ll be able to work with survivors in this space.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\"

The other three projects are registering students to vote, educating faculty on alternatives to expensive textbooks and trying to convert the entire UC system to using 100% renewable energy by 2050.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At last count on Wednesday, the petition to eliminate single-use plastics on UCSB’s campus had 461 signatures, nearly a thousand short of the 1,400 signatures CALPIRG hopes to acquire before the quarter ends and a sliver of the 25,976 students currently enrolled at UCSB.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The single-use plastics ban would eliminate items such as straws, utensils and plastic foam take-out boxes distributed by on-campus restaurants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CALPIRG decided on a petition to ban single-use plastics in order to demonstrate widespread student support for the policy to leaders such as UCSB’s Chancellor Henry Yang or University of California President Janet Napolitano, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The UCs are doing a lot for sustainability, but we think we can do more,” CALPIRG’s Organizing Director Kat Lockwood said. “It would make them a world leader [to ban single-use plastics].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system is already looking into ways to eliminate single-use plastics on campuses by turning to cities with laws minimizing single-use plastics as a model, UC Office of the President (UCOP) Senior Communications Strategist Stett Holbrook said in an email. Berkeley is one such city, which passed a plastic foodware reduction policy in January earlier this year. The UCOP website states that the UCs will ban expanded polystyrene, commonly found in plastic foam take-out containers, by 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC system’s Zero Waste 2020 initiative aims to “divert 90 percent of waste from landfills to recycling and composting facilities, not to eliminate waste by 2020,” Holbrook added. However, the UC system currently measured a 69% diversion rate from 2017-18, according to the 2018 Annual Report on Sustainable Practices, with only three months remaining until 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report also shows that the UC’s diversion rates have hovered in the high-60 and low-70 percentage points since 2017. Holbrook said the UC’s slowed diversion rates are due to “various internal and external barriers, including turmoil in the international recycling markets and the limitations of local waste haulers.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond eliminating single-use plastics, the UCSB CALPIRG chapter has been working on a project to inform professors about open-source educational resources, or OERs, in an effort to shift professors away from expensive textbooks. When the chapter began the campaign last year, 62 faculty or administration members signed on to show support for it, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve had a lot of students come up to our textbook tables and tell us things that they’ve had to give up,” Jennifer Manning, fourth-year student and CALPIRG board member, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One student said that her dad had to give up their family car in order to be able to afford to pay for her textbooks for that quarter. So we want to avoid people having to deal with struggles that are unnecessary when they have to purchase, like a $200 textbook, because their professor wanted the newest edition.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Manning and Michel said they were considering pushing for textbook prices to be included on G.O.L.D. when students sign up for classes but were still undecided on whether or not to pursue that initiative.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSB CALPIRG campaign to get the UCs to run on purely renewable energy is also through a petition, run in the same style as the one banning single-use plastics. Its focus is the heating and cooling units for many on-campus buildings, in addition to the emissions from campus-owned vehicles, according to Manning. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CALPIRG typically works to sign up college students to vote, but this year, the UCSB chapter will pressure the student government to draft a resolution favoring a voting center on campus that allows </span><a href=\"https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/conditional-voter-reg/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">same-day registration</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is only typically allowed at county elections offices and certain designated satellite locations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite her faith that the UCSB community’s values align with CALPIRG’s, Michels admitted that right now, students primarily know them as nuisances with clipboards in the Arbor.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think a lot of it is just a misconception of what we do,” Manning said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They just assume that we’re just this annoying group that wants your signature and wants your money without actually understanding the dynamic of how the group actually operates.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a CALPIRG volunteer approaches someone to ask for their signature, their goal goes beyond drawing support for a petition. It’s also to get contact information, pledge money and possibly a new volunteer, according to Michels.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we find someone that’s interested enough to sign that petition, we’ll ask them to come to another event, so we kind of just exponentially increase the amount of work we can do,” Michels said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each CALPIRG chapter needs to meet a quota of 10-15% of the student body to donate $10 a quarter. The UCSB chapter has never had an issue meeting that number, according to Manning.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although it is not one of their immediate projects, Lockwood said CALPIRG’s board is interested in implementing their quarterly fee as an official UC campus cost across the system. Michel said that the overall cost per student would be cheaper than the current $10 fee if they implement this change but did not have a new number representing what each student would pay. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We wouldn’t have to pester you for money because we wouldn’t have to do our pledge drive,” Manning said. “You want CALPIRG to stop bothering you on the Arbor? Then vote to upgrade our funding.”</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Oct. 3, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em> print edition. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-90111\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-90111\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/calpirg-discusses-latest-projects-plans-for-upcoming-year/","id":1963,"author":{"id":49,"name":"Jackson Guilfoil"},"related":[1962,1961,1960],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/49"}},"__N_SSG":true}
