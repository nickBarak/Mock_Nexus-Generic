In this new “Beatles Revolutions” film series curated by the Carsey-Wolf Center, “A Hard Day’s Night” kicked things off last Thursday with a free screening for students and community members, followed by a Q&amp;A session with journalist Ivor Davis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known for their “Script to Screen” series, this year the Carsey-Wolf Center introduces “Beatles Revolutions.” This winter film series is dedicated to showcasing the lives of those four iconic Liverpool musicians who changed music forever. Examining the various ways The Beatles inspired revolutions not only in music but also in politics and culture, the series includes several different film styles revolving around these topics. With free screenings of the documentaries, animation films, live performances and adaptation films, Pollock is now offering music fans and film buffs alike a wide scope of the true effect The Beatles had on the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most recently, Pollock showed “A Hard Day’s Night,” and Beatles fans of all ages made an appearance to the sold-out screening. While I had been to the Pollock several times prior to this, I had never actually gone to an event there that sold out every ticket. And, after viewing this film, it’s easy to understand why it did. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the film came out in 1964 at the beginning of The Beatles’ vast career, it accurately captures the wave of Beatlemania that was to come. Director Richard Lester uses an interesting filming style that works to both document the group’s antics as well as follow a very loose yet fun plotline. Lester’s style is described by the Carsey-Wolf Center as a “black-and white, semi-documentary style with a cartoonish energy that celebrates the Beatles at work and at play.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A Hard Day’s Night” differs from a lot of movies I’ve seen, as it sticks to no formal film rules and often dances on the fringe of a fictitious and realistic plot. The whole film is centered around the band traveling to appear on television for a live performance, only to face several obstacles along the way and sing their own songs while they’re at it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As The Beatles are musicians before actors, the decision to use the film and band’s popularity to further showcase their music was quite an obvious one. While normally musical scenes in movies can be used to push a story forward or serve as a transition, “A Hard Day’s Night” uses the tracks of the album that have the same name as the film primarily to imbue them with some sort of exposure. Cynically, one can view this film as merely a giant advertisement for the band’s latest album release at the time; however, The Beatles fan in me refuses to do so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filled with witty jokes, thick British accents and classic Beatles tunes like “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “And I Love Her” and, of course, “A Hard Day’s Night,” this film gave its Pollock Theater audience a show to remember. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this screening of “A Hard Day’s Night,” Pollock Theater will be showing several other Beatles-related flicks throughout the course of the 2019 Winter Quarter. Next up is the 1970 film “Let It Be,” which is also known as the last original release from The Beatles and will be playing Jan. 24 at 7 p.m. This film documents the group’s process of recording the songs for their final album and includes footage of their last live public performance on the rooftop of Apple Corps in London. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more Beatlemania, visit the Pollock on Feb. 12 for “I Wanna Hold Your Hand,” Feb. 27 for “Across the Universe” and, finally, March 2 for “Yellow Submarine.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

watching and loving movies of the skateboard genre. I’ve already seen “Lords of Dogtown” and “Bones Brigade: An Autobiography” 50 times each — weren’t those the only ones that mattered? But as I left the theater a few days ago, I realized </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonah Hill’s directorial debut shone as an original skate film all on its own. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film follows the life of Stevie (Sunny Suljic), a young boy who is struggling to belong in a world of abuse and neglect. One day, while biking around his hometown of Los Angeles, Stevie spots his destiny: the coolest boys he’s ever seen, skateboarding on the sidewalk. This group, comprised of Ray (Na-Kel Smith), Fuckshit (Olan Prenatt), Fourth Grade (Ryder McLaughlin) and Ruben (Gio Galicia) introduce a place for brotherhood and acceptance to Stevie, allowing him to blossom into a confident young man.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The component that really drove this film forward was Hill’s ability to cast a bonafide group of gritty teenagers rather than career actors who had never picked up a skateboard before. At only 13 years old, Sunny Suljic completely embodies the disposition of his character: innocent and promising. Ray, the leader of the group, is played by real-life professional skateboarder Na-Kel Smith, who often shows off his skills throughout the movie. By casting genuine boys like these, Hill was able to create a skate movie without any of the generic tricks and references that frequently plague the genre.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Stevie was the main character of “Mid90s,” Fuckshit, played by Olan Prenatt, stood apart from the others as the confident and witty jokester who provided comedic relief during the movie’s tense moments. Fuckshit’s presence in the film wasn’t a dominant one, yet he still managed to steal the spotlight anytime he was on screen. His performance was remarkable; the delivery of his lines was so natural it was almost hard to believe this was his first time acting. During a Q&amp;A with the cast, Jonah Hill even described Prenatt as “one of the most explosively, funny, and charismatic people, so much so, that I forgot to even officially audition him.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the impressive acting in this film, Hill has also successfully managed to capture the ’90s aesthetic through his vintage style of filming. Unlike many modern movies, “Mid90s” is shot on film, not digitally, and is shown in the classic 4:3 aspect ratio. This subtle stylistic choice was the final push that separated “Mid90s” from anything else currently out in theaters, offering the viewer a unique watching experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The soundtrack was also wildly thoughtful. Though Hill chose to use popular ’90s artists like A Tribe Called Quest, Nirvana and Morrissey, he did this tastefully by including their lesser known songs rather than their big hits. In turn, this not only displayed Hill’s appreciation for ’90s music but also worked to make this nostalgic period piece feel more legitimate. Here’s a surprising fact: Because of the low budget on this film, Hill had to personally reach out to every music artist featured in the motion picture soundtrack to gain the rights to play their songs in his movie. “We didn’t have any money and the soundtrack is crazy,” he explained. “I had to write letters to all of my favorite artists … every song that’s in the film, I wrote the scene to have that song in it.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I will say “Mid90s” is far from being perfect. I won’t give away any spoilers, but there are some very questionable scenes that, while I had expected to see them, almost felt too dark, too lengthy and too inappropriate in comparison to the spirit of the rest of the film. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ending felt rather rushed and abrupt. Usually, movie endings offer some kind of resolution, and “Mid90s” was lacking just that. At only an hour and 24 minutes long, Hill could have added more to the plot in order to make the story overall feel more complete. But, since this is his first endeavor as both a writer and director, it’s hard to find too much fault in these shortcomings, especially when there are so many beautiful moments to focus on in the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonah Hill has plenty of room for improvement in his future projects, but this introduction of his into the world of writing and directing was especially commendable. Rather than showing us obnoxious skating and fashion trends for the sake of a retro aesthetic, Hill instead gave us a believable, relatable story with an extremely charismatic, lovable cast. I never would have thought the “Superbad” star would become this dedicated to the art of film, but I’m glad he did.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kvalencia/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kristina Valencia</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kristina Valencia is a fourth-year undergrad majoring in English, minoring in Professional Writing, and working as the Artsweek editor at Daily Nexus.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:kvalencia@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84825\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/jonah-hill-kickflips-into-our-hearts-with-mid90s/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84825\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/jonah-hill-kickflips-into-our-hearts-with-mid90s/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/jonah-hill-kickflips-into-our-hearts-with-mid90s/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/jonah-hill-kickflips-into-our-hearts-with-mid90s/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/jonah-hill-kickflips-into-our-hearts-with-mid90s/","id":5789,"author":{"id":662,"name":"Kristina Valencia"},"related":[5788,5787,5786],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Young Thug Brings Energy to Hallo-weekend","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-11-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-11.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-11.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"A.S.

While the rest of Isla Vista was busy being policed for any pre-Halloween shenanigans, the Thunderdome offered a place of refuge for those who sought amusement as Young Thug headlined this year’s Delirium concert. Organized exclusively for UCSB by A.S. Program Board, the $5 concert was once again met with a successful turnout as the crowd and performers engaged together in this loud, drunken circus of a night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once inside the Thunderdome, the floor that is usually occupied by basketball players had been transformed into a general admission concert pit, filled with sweaty, shirtless frat boys, cat ears and devil horns galore. Dedicated fans could be seen enduring the heat and absence of personal space on the main floor while others lounged in the bleacher seats upstairs waiting for Young Thug. The crowd seemed to grow more excited as 9 p.m. rolled around, with unidentifiable puffs of smoke beginning to fill the air and costumed girls searching for strangers to take Instagram-worthy photos of themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opening act was Social House, a rap duo from Pittsburgh, Pa., comprised of members </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charles “Scootie” Anderson and Michael “Mikey” Foster.

Unlike some of their hip hop contemporaries, Social House has a rather mellow sound that was clearly reflected in the crowd’s demeanor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At previous shows I’ve seen at the Thunderdome, several audience members had already been plucked out of the pit by security guards early on in the night, so it was interesting to not see that occur so soon this time. Observing a lack of chaos, Social House was quick to change that and stir up excitement by asking each side of the audience to scream louder than the other and by playing brand-new songs they had never performed live before. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, at 10:37 p.m., Young Thug made his way onto the stage and was greeted with an uproar of clapping, whistling and shouts of cheer. Despite the boiling temperature inside, Thug was draped in bold fashion choices from head to toe: purple beanie, green sweater, black T-shirt, leather pants and neon green and pink high-top sneakers.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84692\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1071783414\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"84690\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84692\" data-attachment-id=\"84692\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/young-thug-brings-energy-to-hallo-weekend/delirium_marcos-reynoso_online-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1770&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1770\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Delirium_Marcos Reynoso_ONLINE (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=250%2C221&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?fit=888%2C786&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-84692\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1-1024x906.jpg?resize=888%2C786\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C906&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=250%2C221&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=768%2C680&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Delirium_Marcos-Reynoso_ONLINE-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-84692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marcos Reynoso / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening with his song “On the Run,” Young Thug skipped on stage and began jumping in sync with the students in the crowd, fostering an atmosphere that invited everyone to let loose and dance. As the show progressed, the artist brought out a number of guests to the stage, including fellow rapper Duke, who is frequently featured in songs with Young Thug.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toward the middle of the show, Thug climbed off stage and ran straight to the front row, directly center of the ocean of swaying, drunk Gauchos hoping to get a decent selfie with him. Despite the buckets of sweat that had now drenched every student in sight, Thug remained close to these fans for a couple minutes while he continued to rap, eventually being joined down on the floor by Duke. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to “With That,” Thug performed a myriad of hits like “pick up the phone,” “Pull Up On A Kid,” “About The Money” and “Icey.” In the end, Thug concluded his set with the once popular song “Lifestyle,” which famously launched the artist into the public eye with its interestingly unclear lyrics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost immediately after “Lifestyle” ended, Young Thug and his entourage left the stage and the main lights came back on, signaling that it was time to depart. Though the overall performances provided by both Social House and Young Thug were enough to keep concertgoers active and interested for most of the night, many seemed to be disappointed when the show ended after only 50 minutes of Thug’s rapping. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, despite this somewhat quick ending, A.S. Program Board pulled through and succeeded yet again in another year of bringing Gauchos together during the harsh times of our annual Halloween lockdown.</span></p><div

another year of stoner hippie magic, the Desert Daze music festival left quite a mark on its attendees this year. With exciting headliners such as indie gods Tame Impala, classic shoegaze act My Bloody Valentine, and Australian psych-pop band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, this three-day festival seemed like the perfect escape into a psychedelic wonderland.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As I was driving myself out to Lake Perris, Desert Daze’s new location, I got a phone call from one of my housemates telling me that she had been waiting in line for parking for over an hour. By the time I finally made it all the way out there myself, I recognized instantly what she was talking about. The line of cars waiting to get into the festival spanned over a mile or two until you couldn’t see where the line ended.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Eventually, I noticed more and more people either turning their cars completely off because of the stand-still, inescapable traffic or sparking up some joints to pass the time while they remained prisoners in their cars. Jocelyn Guardado (@GuardadoJocelyn) even wrote via Twitter, “First and last desert daze. Car ran out [of] gas from the long line. I love waiting in this heat so that my boyfriend can walk two miles to the nearest gas station.” Although Guardado’s case is unfortunate, several others claimed to have waited as long as four hours and still missed most of the Friday performances.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p class=\"p3\">Once inside the venue, it was clear the anger from trying to park had vanished and most festival goers were once again excited for the music. Although Desert Daze, as the name mentions, is normally held in a desert setting, the festival this year made its debut at Lake Perris. It gave off an adult summer camp feel, with campsites across the lot, a beach to swim in and an amazing view of the Moreno Beach mountains. Festival attendees could be seen frolicking in the water as bands played their sets right next to them. In addition to the beauty of Mother Nature that engulfed Desert Daze, several fun food vendors and other booths were scattered throughout the festival grounds.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Like Coachella and other music festivals, Desert Daze had multiple stages: the Moon, the Block, the Theatre, the Sanctuary and the Mystic Bazaar. Besides the Bazaar, which was for campers only, each stage was relatively close to one another, making it easy for attendees to hop from band to band and view insane, Instagram-worthy art installations along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Although it was apparent most attendees were mainly excited to see Tame Impala, the rest of the bands on the Friday lineup didn’t disappoint. Lesser known artists like Idles, Hinds and Jarvis Cocker shone as old and new fans alike were captivated by their performances, often taking small breaks from dancing to light up and drink. More interestingly, though, was the performance of Warpaint, who took the stage right before Tame Impala. Their psych-rock sound, in combination with the feminine edge that comes exclusively from a girls-only band, seemed to call each person to the stage with their hits like “Elephants,” “Undertow” and “Disco//Very.”</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As the sun began to set on the first night of Desert Daze, the weather became noticeably colder and more people could be seen retreating to their cars to grab jackets, hats and more joints. Though the main stage had been previously occupied by fans enjoying the sets of Warpaint and Pond a couple hours earlier, the Moon Stage was now filled to the max with agonizing anticipation of Tame Impala’s performance. However, it wasn’t until lightning started to strike that the excitement grew.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Scheduled to perform at 10 p.m., Tame Impala entered the stage about 10 minutes late, beginning with their song “Nangs” accompanied by trippy, psychedelic visual art that covered the screens surrounding the band. As the rain began to pick up and lightning became more frequent, Tame Impala quickly jumped into “Let It Happen,” inciting the whole crowd to collectively jump and sway their heads side to side to the familiar and well-loved song. As the long instrumental break blared out of the speakers, my view of Kevin Parker diminished as I got lost in a cloud of weed and vape smoke coming from my fellow standing neighbors.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">While Tame Impala played for as long and well as they could, they were no match for the storm that was to come. The flashes of lightning continued to get so much brighter and more frequent than before that festival attendees began enjoying the scene, fully immersing themselves in the chaos of music and nature combining into one coherent experience. So, when the music stopped after 20 minutes and Parker said, “Sorry guys, we gotta go,” it was clear no one had anticipated this short ending. One of the festival coordinators then came out and assured fans that Tame Impala would come back out after the weather cleared up but that everyone was urged to seek shelter in cars or buildings. In the end, though, the Tame set was canceled as well as every other act scheduled to perform after them — and fans were pissed.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">In an attempt to make up for the unforeseen weather disturbances during Friday, Desert Daze gave everyone free parking for the weekend and allowed attendees with Friday tickets to enjoy the festival on Saturday as well at no extra charge.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">When Saturday morning finally came around, the rain, lightning and thunder had ceased, creating a cool forecast for festival goers to enjoy throughout the rest of the weekend. To close the show, Death Grips and My Bloody Valentine performed back-to-back, giving audience members unique takes on what psychedelic music can sound like. While Death Grips gave a rather exciting performance, never taking any breaks during their set, My Bloody Valentine really brought it home with their signature garage rock playing that incited enormous response from the crowd. This was especially apparent during their song “Soon,” to which many fans began jumping and throwing elbows and fists as a form of dancing.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Though there were some pretty big hiccups with the organization and execution of this festival, Desert Daze still gave its attendees a great playground to meet new people, camp, swim and, of course, enjoy the music.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Hopefully, they will look at the weather report next year!</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

all-female quartet with a unique kind of spice and punch unmatched by anyone else in the current indie music scene. What sets Hinds apart from so many others is their spirit that they successfully manage to communicate through their lo-fi, garage rock sound. Focused more on making music they enjoy rather than creating what seems to be the most profitable sound, Hinds fully embodies what it means to be fun, confident and carefree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fresh off the release of their second studio album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I Don’t Run</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Hinds will be taking the stage of Santa Barbara’s very own SOhO on Sept. 22. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many other indie bands, Hinds got their start on Bandcamp with the original band name “Deers,” which was comprised of founding members Carlotta Cosials and Ana Garc</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ía Perrote.

Since 2015, these ladies have collaborated with other bands like The Parrots, sold exclusive limited edition merch at Urban Outfitters and played in multiple music festivals like South by Southwest and Burgerama. During a live performance on Seattle radio station KEXP, Cosials even recalls their experience of South by Southwest by explaining, “We did 16 shows in four days, we’re so proud of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With influences like Mac DeMarco, The Strokes, Ty Segall and The Vaccines, these ladies know how to create a groovy tune while simultaneously attacking their music and lyrics with a raw, feminine edge. Their newest album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I Don’t Run</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, explores the difficulties and confusions that come with falling in love and presents its listener with rather realistic feelings of self-doubt, longing and vulnerability. For example, their leading single from this sophomore album, “New For You,” describes a desire to become a new, better version of yourself in the name of love. Lyrics like “Because I wanna be somebody new for you” and “Because I only wanna dream if you’re by my side” display a serious love and commitment for someone in the simplest way possible. As seen similarly throughout their entire discography, these Hinds lyrics cut right to the point and make it clear what they want to say. It’s because of this naivety and simplicity of theirs that so many fans are able to let loose, rock out to their music and feel a real connection to the group. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Hinds is far from being the perfect band, their potential for greatness is as apparent as the sky is blue. It’s uncertain whether these Spanish gals will take over the charts in the near future, but it is clear their mere presence in the male-dominated music industry stands as an inspiration for female artists everywhere.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kvalencia/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kristina Valencia</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kristina Valencia is a fourth-year undergrad majoring in English, minoring in Professional Writing, and working as the Artsweek editor at Daily Nexus.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:kvalencia@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83984\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/get-your-be-hinds-ready-for-hinds/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83984\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/get-your-be-hinds-ready-for-hinds/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/get-your-be-hinds-ready-for-hinds/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/get-your-be-hinds-ready-for-hinds/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/get-your-be-hinds-ready-for-hinds/","id":6672,"author":{"id":662,"name":"Kristina Valencia"},"related":[6671,6670,6669],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Dillon Francis, Charli XCX, and More Tear it Up at Extravaganza ‘18","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2018-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"In case you missed it, A.S.

Program Board (ASPB) presented the students of UCSB with their fun (and free) annual festival on the grass of Harder Stadium last weekend, featuring DJBJ,  Coast Modern, DRAM, Charli XCX and Dillon Francis. While, yes, many pessimists sought to degrade this line-up through Facebook comments and Twitter replies, there was no denying that every Gaucho in attendance was grateful for a temporary escape from the usual hangover-filled and homework-stuffed Sunday routine. In addition to this exciting cast of musicians set to play Extravaganza, several student vendors outlined the edges of the stadium and plenty of Instagram-worthy photo ops were available with the venue’s artsy tents, aesthetic signs and inflatable festival monster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening up Extravaganza this year was recent Battle of the DJs winner, DJBJ. This duo, wearing matching red, white and blue jerseys, brought forth an exciting, naive energy to the stage as they stood side by side spinning tracks together. However, even though everything seemed to be all “good vibes” and whatnot, DJBJ did have the difficult task of engaging a small audience since they began performing shortly after the gates opened, before many of the people showed up to Extravaganza. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an effort to appeal to every music taste out there, DJBJ played a variety of hits from different genres in this amateur performance of theirs, displaying a breadth in music knowledge and appreciation. During their set, DJBJ remixed new songs like “Wild Thoughts” by Rihanna and “Nice For What” by Drake, then switched it up and played older artists like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Timberlake and Estelle. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following DJBJ was another musical duo, this time of the indie sort: Coast Modern. Originally formed in Los Angeles a few years ago by Luke Atlas and Coleman Trapp, Coast Modern has since grown into an established pop-rock band that has toured with popular artists like BØRNS, The Wombats and The Temper Trap. In between songs during their Extravaganza set, Atlas and Trapp frequently engaged with the audience, getting the crowd to sing and clap along with them and even referenced UCSB as the “University of Cool Skateboards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though their most recent album came out in 2017, Coast Modern has been releasing singles since 2015, like “Animals,” which many students in the crowd seemed to know and like. It was this track in particular that stood out the most as it provided a mellow, flowing beat with easy lyrics that anyone could sing along to. In a world of auto-tune and electronica, it was rather refreshing to see a live band perform as Coast Modern did, with even more authenticity and pizazz than audibly present in their studio recorded tracks. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83299\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1386099079\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83296\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83299\" data-attachment-id=\"83299\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/dillon-francis-charli-xcx-and-more-tear-it-up-at-extravaganza-18/extrav-by-siavash-ghadiri-online-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=2000%2C1335&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Extrav by Siavash Ghadiri ONLINE-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?fit=888%2C593&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83299\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=888%2C593\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"593\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Extrav-by-Siavash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-83299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known largely for his hit “Broccoli” featuring Lil Yachty, DRAM performed after Coast Modern, switching up the theme from calm indie to exciting hip hop. Before DRAM (aka Does Real Ass Music) came out on stage, his DJ tested out the waters first, making sure us Gauchos were hyped enough for the rapper to begin his set. As he began singing, it was apparent the attendance rate at Extravaganza had exponentially grown since the gates’ opening at 1 p.m. (as did the number of drunk students asking to be lifted out of the pit by surrounding security guards). Prefacing his song “Cute,” DRAM explained to us that we should be striving to spread love every day and tell those we like that we “think they’re cute,” as he often says in his song. Overall, the energy DRAM brought to the stage kept everyone’s mood afloat and invited more students to let go and actively engage with his music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up was the woman who stole the show, popstar Charli XCX. Regardless of Dillon Francis being the headliner for Extravaganza, Charli fans made their way to the front of the stage for her set at 4:20 and made it clear that she was the most anticipated act. Making her way into the music scene with features in hits like “I Love It” by Icona Pop and “Fancy” by Iggy Azalea, Charli XCX has worked tirelessly to make a name for herself by releasing solo albums such as her most recent </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pop 2,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which came out in 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting her set with “Boom Clap,” Charli jumped out from backstage wearing an all white, loose-fitting outfit that allowed her to dance any which way she chose. The combination of her charismatic stage presence and the familiarity of the song worked as an invitation for students to dance along with her, as she often tried to hype everyone up with phrases like, “UCSB, fuck it up!” and “When the beat drops, I want you guys to go crazy!” During her set, wigs were thrown to the stage, Charli abandoned her platform to sing directly with fans in the crowd and a giant beach ball travelled over the tops of everyone’s heads.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83301\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a

well-known artist and producer, Dillon Francis. Though 15 minutes late to his scheduled set time, Francis presented students with loud, electronic music and very stimulating visuals that transformed the event from festival to rave. Hidden behind a giant screen which housed all of Francis’ DJing equipment, the crowd was able to directly interact with the music rather than focusing on the artist himself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it was quite cool to have a DJ as successful as Francis performing on our campus, his set didn’t sound too far removed from what you might hear at a decent party on DP. The music was loud and techno-heavy, and it had a beat that every lit UCSB student could comfortably dance to in the realm of Harder Stadium. So in that sense, his set was a success. In any event, after two and a half quarters of hard work, ASPB pulled through and gave Gauchos a safe environment to let loose, enjoy some good live music and even get free reusable water bottles. ‘Til next time, Extravaganza! </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The unique and sophisticated style of Børns has even caught the eye of Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele, who often supplies his wardrobe for major events like Coachella and music video shoots.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As people made their way to their seats, Børns continued dancing across the stage and singing his soft pop-rock hits, each with more fervor than the last. It was during this time that die-hard fans of his made themselves apparent, as they begun to spring from their seats and caper in both the seated and general admission sections. Because of the time limit on his set, Børns sped his way through the first two-thirds of his set list by cutting out certain verses and choruses to reserve time for his other better-known singles.</p>\n<p>Once he brought out the guitar for “10,000 Emerald Pools” and begun strumming, everyone around me seemed to raise their heads in recognition and finally allowed themselves to join the surrounding excitement. Following this song were a couple others like “We Don’t Care,” “Sweet Dreams,” “Faded Heart” and finally the song that put him on the map: “Electric Love.” It was during this song that he picked up the guitar once again and invited the audience to sing the beginning harmonies along with him.</p>\n<p>While the headliners of this show were alt-J, it was quite clear that this crowd would now be leaving the SB Bowl with a new appreciation for the music, style and stage presence of a very Mick-Jagger-esque Børns.</p>\n<p>Although it was obvious that an alt-J concert would attract all the local hipsters here in Santa Barbara, it was quite interesting to see the diversity in the age of audience members. This further reinforces the likeability of alt-J, as they’re able to appeal to almost anyone — Glenn Howerton, better known as Dennis on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” was even there showing his support and admiration for the band as a fellow civilian concertgoer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82530\" style=\"width: 1810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"620383098\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82528\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82530\" data-attachment-id=\"82530\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/alt-j-and-borns-breeze-through-santa-barbara-bowl/unnamed-54/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=1800%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1800,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82530\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Beginning their lively set with “Deadcrush” off their newest studio album <em>Relaxer</em>, alt-J presented their fans with a very visually stunning stage setup and light show. From left to right was Gus Unger-Hamilton on keyboard, Joe Newman on guitar and vocals and Thom Sonny Green on drums, with each member divided by an open-knit curtain of lights that synchronized with the band’s music. Additionally, behind them was a giant lit-up triangle that the band uses as a logo since it comes from the Greek letter “delta” and represents change.</p>\n<p>Everywhere, fans were either jumping out of their seats and belting out each word to each song or happily relaxing while they bobbed their heads along to the contagious melodies. New songs like “In Cold Blood” and “Pleader” seemed to capture and maintain the attention of the crowd; however, it was incomparable to the change in audience hype when alt-J performed fan favorites like “Fitzpleasure,” “Tesselate” and “Matilda.” It was during these songs in particular that sober and drunk fans alike were able to come together and truly express their love for the music as one coherent entity.</p>\n<p>In an effort to wrap things up, alt-J ended their set with “Left Hand Free,” which has been played almost everywhere since its release and has since been featured in major motion picture films like “Captain America: Civil War.” This was the one that got each audience member up off their feet as they were enticed to sing along to the band’s biggest hit. All too soon though, the stage went from flickering purple and white lights to pure darkness, and everyone was left waiting in anticipation for an encore.</p>\n<p>In the end, the boys of alt-J came back out to perform an additional three songs for their eager and beloved fans, and the show concluded with the song that made them famous to begin with: “Breezeblocks.” After a night of playing a medley of old and new songs, it was rather refreshing to see alt-J go back to their roots and give thanks to the many that have helped them achieve this level of success. If you happened to miss this spectacular show here at the Santa Barbara Bowl, both alt-J and Børns, will be playing at Weekend 2 of Coachella –– so go catch them if you can.</p><div

Deltopia weekend, the Thunderdome was the place to be last Saturday night. After a long day of dayging (not darty-ing), UCSB students were graced with the musical presence of Vince Staples and special guest Baauer for their sold-out Warm Up show, presented by A.S. Program Board.</p>\n<p>As the doors opened at 8:30 p.m., hundreds of antsy students waiting in line burst through the entrance, clearly excited for an eventful performance. The room quickly began to fill with a combination of dedicated hip hop fans, as well as many people coming off their Deltopia high, creating a kind of sweaty, messy nightclub atmosphere —or at least what someone underage like myself would assume a nightclub is like. Outside of the venue, many students were lined up at the box office outside due to a ticketing error that prevented them from entering. Nevertheless, despite this unfortunate ticketing mistake, the general mood of the crowd felt happy and enthusiastic as they awaited the show that was to come (except for those who couldn’t get in — sorry).</p>\n<p>Special guest Baauer opened the show with an electronic DJ set, similar to what you might see and hear in a rave or at an EDM festival. Made famous from his viral hit, “Harlem Shake,” Baauer has since added to his resume by winning EDM song of year at the Billboard Music Awards, making guest appearances on songs like “Talk Bout Me” by Major Lazer and remixing songs from popular artists in different music genres like No Doubt. Rather than choosing to accept his 15 minutes of fame from the internet success of the “Harlem Shake,” Baauer continues to make music and DJ for people all around the world out of the love for music, which is something to be admired.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As Baauer came out on the stage, the rapid and colorful lighting kept his face hidden in silhouette as drunk teens and 20-year-olds in every direction went ballistic. While it was unclear how the DJ himself felt about the crowd due to the strategic lighting, it was apparent that the people in the sea of clout goggles, space buns and Vans were having the time of their lives. Soon enough, however, Baauer left the stage and UCSB students were once again left waiting anxiously for another performer to come take their minds off the feeling of claustrophobia that comes with being an active concertgoer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82427\" style=\"width: 2010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1804741295\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82421\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82427\" data-attachment-id=\"82427\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/vince-staples-ignites-the-warm-up/the-warmup-2018-by-sivash-ghadiri-online-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=2000%2C1236&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1236\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"The Warmup 2018 by Sivash Ghadiri ONLINE-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=250%2C155&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?fit=888%2C549&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-82427\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=888%2C549\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"549\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=250%2C155&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C475&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C633&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Warmup-2018-by-Sivash-Ghadiri-ONLINE-2-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82427\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Fresh off his most recent release, <em>Big Fish Theory</em>, in 2017, Vince Staples has been touring the country performing for fellow rap and hip hop enthusiasts alike. Unlike his debut studio album, <em>Summertime ’06</em>, this second endeavor probes the difficulty of trying to grasp and understand the phenomenon of sudden fame, accompanied with strong electronic and dance influences. As someone who’s grown up in southern California, Staples stays close to his West Coast roots in his quick rapping style and mesmerizing beats which are present in both albums.</p>\n<p>In addition to being a talented rapper, Staples also has a rather philanthropic side as he himself grew up in unfavorable economic circumstances. Concerned with the growing glamorization of dangerous gang lifestyles, Vince Staples is an active member of his community YMCA in North Long Beach where he encourages the youth to try their hand at creative hobbies such as graphic design, music production and filmmaking.</p>\n<p>As the Thunderdome stage went black and a single golden light emerged, the figure of Vince Staples was revealed as he dove straight into his performance and the crowd turned into one jumping entity. However, it wasn’t until he started performing his newest hit “Big Fish” that people really began to let go and engage with the music; the initial ticking of the song was enough to get everyone’s arms thrown in the air, ready to shout the lyrics. This was a sight that could’ve been seen throughout the entire venue, as devoted Vince Staples fans were located in front of the stage, on top of the bleachers, and even dancing in the very back behind all the main commotion.</p>\n<p>The dramatic (and potentially seizure-inducing) lighting dared the audience to treat the show as if it were a true festival. During the performance of popular songs like “Norf Norf” and “Get The Fuck Off My Dick” for example, students were desperately trying to simultaneously keep rhythm with the music and the changing lights, creating a hype that invoked everyone inside the Thunderdome to join in and enjoy the fun.</p>\n<p>Rap may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but either way, there’s no denying that Vince Staples has great talent and a good heart. Though his music career is fairly young, he’s already collaborated with several other musicians who have appeared at UCSB, like Billie Eilish, won impressive awards like Best Impact Track from the BET Hip Hop Awards, and has potential for so much more. In a world of fake musicians with nothing but dollar signs in mind, the Thunderdome was able to host one of the few that fall outside of this category.</p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_82426\"

Santa Barbara Bowl on April 16 with musical guest, Børns. Known for hits like “Left Hand Free” and “Breezeblocks,” alt-J has since added more tracks to their roster of fun, festival music perfect for the laid-back beach lifestyle here in SB.</p>\n<p>Opening up the show will be the multi-talented singer-songwriter Børns. Originally from Michigan, Garrett Borns has been a creative force since age 10 when he was a professional magician and eventually worked his way up to receiving awards for his drawings and various other forms of visual art. At 19 he was even giving TED Talks, during which he’d perform original songs right on stage.</p>\n<p>Since making his first debut in 2015 with his album <em>Dopamine,</em> Børns has made his way onto the charts with hit singles like “Electric Love,” “American Money” and “10,000 Emerald Pools.” This past January, he released his second studio album, <em>Blue Madonna,</em> which features Lana Del Rey on multiple tracks and encompasses heavy themes of heartbreak, confusion and love. In addition to playing this show with alt-J, Børns will also be performing both weekends this year at Coachella.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>After a three-year period of no new music, alt-J is finally on the road again touring for their new album, <em>Relaxer, </em>which came out June 2nd of last year and was nominated for the Mercury Prize of 2017.</p>\n<p>While alt-J consider themselves “just guys from Leeds who muddled through it,” many seem to think otherwise; their music has been included in popular, high-grossing films like “Silver Linings Playbook,” “Captain America: Civil War” and others.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2008 as a simple college band self-producing music through GarageBand, alt-J has since grown into the indie sensation they are today, headlining their own tours and playing in various music festivals around the world.</p>\n<p>Although their new album contains only eight songs, alt-J’s most recent <em>Relaxer</em> represents a slight change and growth in the band’s musical abilities and direction. <em>Relaxer</em> differs from its predecessors as it incorporates darker themes and slower songs as seen in tracks like “3WW,” “Adeline,” “Last Year” and their cover of The Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun.” However, don’t let this discourage you from listening as the album also features fun songs like “In Cold Blood” and “Hit Me Like That Snare” which are reminiscent of the classic alt-J sound made present in previous albums <em>This Is All Yours</em> and <em>An Awesome Wave</em>. Alt-J will also be performing both weekends of Coachella this year in case you can’t make the show here in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Tickets are still available! They can be found online at <em>sbbowl.com</em> and range from $50-$60 in price.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

Located under Storke Tower, KCSB has been spinning tracks since 1962 when its founder, Bill Harrison, founded the first University of California non-commercial and educational radio station. Since then, it has grown into a platform where local students and community members can share underrepresented music and news without the interference of advertisements or paid content. So, if you’re looking to find some new tunes, here are the shows to listen to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KCSB’s most popular genre is of the eclectic variety. Because this style is so diverse and wide-ranged, it’s almost impossible not to like at least one of these shows. Described as a show full of “mellow haze and obfuscated rays” is B.no’s “To Andromeda and Back.” This show plays everything from what they call “noise rock vomit” to baroque to shadow electronic, often playing artists like Portugal. the Man, Mac DeMarco, The War on Drugs, Alvvays, Kurt Vile and many others. If you’re into a wide variety of hipster indie, rock or pop, this is the show that has it all. “To Andromeda and Back” is on air Mondays 8-10 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re into the current punk and DIY scene, then “Kells Bells” might just be the perfect show for you. Often going back and forth from playing modern rock to rock from the ’60s and ’70s, DJ Kellan Staninger makes sure not only to highlight the works of these lesser known artists, but also to describe their creative process as well. The diversity in the “Kells Bells” lineup is vast, ranging from older bands like The Kinks, Electric Light Orchestra and The Velvet Underground to more modern artists like Ariel Pink, Car Seat Headrest, Ty Segall, Wavves, R. Stevie Moore and more (pun intended). “Kells Bells” is on air Fridays 2-4 p.m.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever wanted a radio station dedicated entirely to female vocalists of every genre? KCSB DJ Julia does just that with her show “She’s Lost Control.” Ranging from popular indie tracks by artists like Mazzy Star to more ambient songs with little to no vocals whatsoever, this show highlights the importance of women in the music industry. Additionally, this show serves a greater purpose than just spreading female music: It stands as a gesture to point out the inequalities women face when trying to pursue a typically male-dominated field. So to that I say thank you to DJ Julia. Her show often features a great variety of female artists and groups like Midwife, Frankie Cosmos, Hinds, Nadia Villa and Angel Olsen. “She’s Lost Control” is on air Saturdays 3-5 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up is DJ Stanley Naftaly’s show “Jazz Straight Ahead.” What sets this jazz show apart from the others at KCSB is the fact that Stanley Naftaly has been a DJ here since 1968. This show focuses primarily on the music of classic jazz players from the ’40s and ’70s. This show includes musicians like Miles Davis, Modern Jazz Quartet, Jimmy Giuffre, Mulgrew Miller and Louis Armstrong. While the entire archive of this show since the ’60s isn’t available online, you can still check out his radio playlists from as early as August of 2009. “Jazz Straight Ahead” is on air Thursdays 12-2 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, we have Angel Lopez’s show, “Rock Latino”, which is described as “a mix of Spanish-language rock, funk, ska and more, with a fusion of Latin rhythms.” Similar to Naftaly, DJ Angel Lopez has been working at KCSB for years (since 1995!), which really demonstrates his passion and love for Latino rock music. Some of the artists Lopez plays on “Rock Latino” are Ska-P, La Castaneda, Nacha Pop, Twin Tones, Gustavo Cerati, Voodoo Glow Skulls and many others. This radio show might be the most original on KCSB as it successfully bridges the gap between American rock and Latinx rock. “Rock Latino”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is on air Tuesdays 6-8 p.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I chose to spread light on only these five KCSB shows, each and every one truly has its own unique value that deserves to be listened to. Because KCSB is non-commercial and run by students and local community members, none of these programmers get paid for their time on air. This kind of commitment and passion for music is what’s kept it alive since the beginning of time, so why not tune in and enjoy the hard work your fellow Gauchos have put into their radio shows? The next time you’re looking for background music to accompany you while you study or exercise, try skipping your normal Spotify playlist and tune into KCSB instead — you might just find your next favorite artist.  </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

UCSB students and other community members of Goleta were given an escape from midterms, work and stress as The Hub provided a space to enjoy live music and artistic creativity for 2018’s Battle of the Bands. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kicking off the show was Frisson, the only band of the night to include a girl on both instruments and vocals. Their steady guitar picking, synth keyboard breaks and cow bell solos truly captured the spirit of Isla Vista: simultaneously chill and exciting. Combining the classic guitar sound with an ’80s-esque synthesizer definitely worked in favor of Frisson by creating an unusual and infectious beat anyone could get down with. Utilizing both the bassist and guitarist for lead vocals, this band gave the audience a variety of tone as well as a contagious case of foot-tapping and head-nodding. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up was The Mallards, whose dramatic and confident stage presence caught everyone’s attention before they even started playing. The rhythm created by each member passionately playing their designated instruments incited the crowd to be as equally engaged with the music as they were. Soon enough, everyone on the dancefloor became a sea of bright iPhone flashlights, swaying with the beat of the guitar and clapping to the beat of the drum. In the heat of the moment, drummer Jake Morenc even opted to go shirtless. However, as their music quickly turned from steady to fast-paced, the band’s antics grew more chaotic and exciting, lighting up the entire atmosphere in The Hub. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following those two bands came Milk Drunk, who dedicated their performance to another local I.V. band, RabbitFoot. Jumping right into their first song, this trio set the crowd on fire not only with their fast, loud and fearless sound but also with their confident and carefree stage presence. Drummer Kellan Staninger was seen going H.A.M. the entire performance, not letting the drums breathe for a second while bassist Aaron Kopperman danced all over the stage, enticing the crowd to do the same and let loose. Unlike Frisson and The Mallards, Milk Drunk focuses more on being a punk band with a message, often mentioning controversial subjects like politics and how policymakers have control over things that don’t affect them. In between songs, lead vocalist and guitarist Ethan Jones spoke to the crowd and voiced his disgust for current policies that will affect our adult lives after college and even introduced a song saying, “This next one’s about climate change and how the government’s fucking us.” While Milk Drunk clearly cares about music as a form of creative expression, they also use their platform to spread awareness about important issues they genuinely care about, which, in my opinion, is pretty cool. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Milk Drunk was a tough act to follow, Odd Army did not fail to entertain. Aligning with the metal and hard-rock genres, Odd Army essentially distinguished themselves from everyone else performing at Battle of the Bands with their unique, head-banging sound. During their cover of “Bulls on Parade” by Rage Against the Machine, metalheads and fellow Guitar Hero players sang along loud and proud to the band’s impeccable rendition of the song. While each member in Odd Army clearly demonstrated their amazing musical abilities, lead singer and guitarist Alec Luttrell gave soul to the stage with his multiple guitar solos that seemed to say more than lyrics ever could. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last band of the night was Backwood Bishops, a local I.V. band that combines the sounds of rock, pop, funk and soul all into one. The dynamic musical relationship each bandmate had with one another worked to fully engage and invite the crowd into their funky realm of rock. The highlight of their set was their cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Superstitious,” as everyone on the floor could easily join in to dance and sing along. Although each band that performed had a rock/indie/alternative vibe, Backwood Bishops strayed away from doing the bare minimum and used their passion for R&amp;B to create a unique sound.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Backwood Bishops finished their set, both the crowd and band members were anxious to find out who won. It was clear that judges Ted Coe (KCSB), Erika Papac (Santa Barbara Bowl), and Christopher Tyng (film and TV music composer) would have a tough decision to make. In the end, Odd Army placed third, Backwood Bishops second and Milk Drunk first. Although Milk Drunk is one of the newest bands in Isla Vista, their passion and love for punk rock has safely secured their spot as top dog and fan favorite. When asked what she thought of the final results and of Milk Drunk in general, second-year psychology and sociology double major Ainsly Rivera said, “Milk Drunk captivated the audience through the energy of the music and the physical performance. The bassist was killing it with the footwork. If it were a legitimate show, I would’ve swung in the pit!”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f0428760b1f56d7fd91611a8d648584d?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/kvalencia/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Kristina Valencia</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Kristina Valencia is a fourth-year undergrad majoring in English, minoring in Professional Writing, and working as the Artsweek editor at Daily Nexus.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-socials \"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"mailto:kvalencia@dailynexus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"saboxplugin-icon-grey\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"sab-user_email\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M502.3 190.8c3.9-3.1 9.7-.2 9.7 4.7V400c0 26.5-21.5 48-48 48H48c-26.5 0-48-21.5-48-48V195.6c0-5 5.7-7.8 9.7-4.7 22.4 17.4 52.1 39.5 154.1 113.6 21.1 15.4 56.7 47.8 92.2 47.6 35.7.3 72-32.8 92.3-47.6 102-74.1 131.6-96.3 154-113.7zM256 320c23.2.4 56.6-29.2 73.4-41.4 132.7-96.3 142.8-104.7 173.4-128.7 5.8-4.5 9.2-11.5 9.2-18.9v-19c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112v19c0 7.4 3.4 14.3 9.2 18.9 30.6 23.9 40.7 32.4 173.4 128.7 16.8 12.2 50.2 41.8 73.4 41.4z\"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/milk-drunk-crowned-winner-of-battle-of-the-bands/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/milk-drunk-crowned-winner-of-battle-of-the-bands/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/milk-drunk-crowned-winner-of-battle-of-the-bands/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/milk-drunk-crowned-winner-of-battle-of-the-bands/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/milk-drunk-crowned-winner-of-battle-of-the-bands/","id":6892,"author":{"id":662,"name":"Kristina Valencia"},"related":[6891,6890,6889],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/662"}},"__N_SSG":true}
