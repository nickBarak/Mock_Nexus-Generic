Cocaine has had a tumultuous history and continues to be one of the most consumed and demanded drugs to cross U.S. borders. But what is it and why is it so controversial?</p>\n<p>Cocaine is a substance that comes from the <em>erythroxylum coca </em>plant that grows in South America. The leaves have been used since the 17th century for medicinal purposes and many workers still chew it today to alleviate hunger pains and elevation sickness. To turn the coca leaf into the powdery substance most of us recognize, the leaves undergo a multistep chemical process. The coca leaves are soaked in gasoline and other chemicals including ammonia and sulfuric acid, filtered and heated to produce the powder or crystal form of cocaine hydrochloride. The cocaine is then distributed, most often via drug cartels, to countries all over the world. According to Business Insider, almost all of the world’s cocaine supply is made in Columbia, Peru and Bolivia. Obtaining pure cocaine, however, is not guaranteed. Some of these chemicals include caffeine, designer drugs and meth.</p>\n<p>“It is very, very, very, <em>very</em> rare that you get cocaine pure, so students are unaware often what they’re taking and that’s what causes a lot of risk and problems, because cocaine is often cut with many, many harmful chemicals,” Lacey Johnson, counselor and educator for UCSB’s Alcohol and Drug Program, said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>On the consumer level, how does cocaine affect the brain once in the body? Cocaine can be administered in several ways: absorption through nasal tissue (snorted), diluted into water and injected or — if the crystal substance is obtained — smoked. Once in the body, cocaine takes over the part of the central nervous system that is responsible for rewarding us with the feel good chemical, dopamine, released when we do things such as eat, drink or have sex. Normally, dopamine crosses gaps between nerves and receptors at regulated levels and then returns to the original nerve cell to be reused later. Cocaine increases dopamine levels by 400 to 800 percent above normal levels. It also blocks the dopamine from returning to the nerve cells that released it, so dopamine builds up very quickly, giving users a feeling of euphoria, happiness and alertness.</p>\n<p>While the high of cocaine feels really good, it does not last very long. Cynthia Kuhn, author of <em>Buzzed: The Straight Facts About the Most Used and Abused Drugs from Alcohol to Ecstasy,</em> writes, “liver and blood enzymes degrade about half of a cocaine dose in about an hour. This means that a user is usually ready for another dose in about forty minutes or less.”</p>\n<p>“After people do coke, usually people felt so, so good that now that the [reward-pleasure pathway] factory has depleted what it has so people will feel depressed and irritable because there’s nothing there to help you,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>On its own, cocaine has many risks, including damage to brain cells, seizures, constricted arteries, vascular disease, damage to the nose and risk of addiction. Heavy users are susceptible to strokes, brain bleeds and memory and thought deficits. When alcohol is added to the mix, as it often is, a whole new compound is created that has more adverse effects. Alcohol and cocaine create a highly toxic chemical in the liver called cocaethylene that increases the likelihood of an early heart attack or sudden death. In addition, cocaine masks the effect of alcohol, which leads to higher BACs.</p>\n<p>“People will be drinking and feel really drunk, and then they’ll do a line and think ‘Oh, I don’t feel as drunk anymore, I can have another beer,’” Johnson said. “Really, they’re just as drunk — nothing has changed in their blood, but they don’t feel as drunk so they tend to drink more and their BACs climb. Also, mixing alcohol and cocaine speeds up the metabolism, so alcohol reaches the brain faster.”</p>\n<p>The drug is often part of the “work hard, play hard” mentality that is popular among many college campuses. According to a study done at School of Public Health in Maryland, 13 percent of students had used cocaine by their fourth year in college. Programs like UCSB’s Drug and Alcohol Program aim to decrease harm and increase safety.</p>\n<p>“We want to help students make healthy and safe choices,” Johnson said. “We help students weigh out their risks with the understanding that students are adults and they have to make their own decisions. We want to make sure students know every risk that is involved.”</p>\n<p>For more information on drug or alcohol use and services offered by the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program, visit their website: <em>alcohol.sa.ucsb.edu</em> or call (805) 893 – 5013.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 23 of the Thursday, Oct. 29 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

This is a commonly held view on the early morning or afternoon, perhaps even an evening pick-me-up for a tolerant few, despite across the board research studies which link coffee to more health benefits than almost any other beverage we’re drinking.</p>\n<p>Aaron Carroll, professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, attempts to lay rest to the notion of coffee as a vice in a recent <em>NY Times</em> article, citing a range of studies that show how coffee decreases risk of certain diseases and, in some cases, may even provide protection from them. Carroll writes, “Coffee has long had a reputation as being unhealthy. But in almost every single respect that reputation is backward.”</p>\n<p>So first, why is the consensus on coffee so distributed in the face of otherwise overwhelming evidence in favor of the beverage? One, there are many confounding variables in epidemiological studies that make correlation or patterns. For example, participants in studies looking at coffee consumption may have smoking and drinking habits that are not accounted for when evaluating risk factors. Secondly, published studies that receive the most publicity usually report on outliers — including a few that have implicated coffee or caffeine with hypertension, heart disease and some forms of cancer. However, as Carroll notes, when studies are viewed collectively, the negative effects of coffee usually fall by the wayside.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Many believe that coffee might be associated with an increased risk of <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\"><u>cancer</u></a>,” Carroll writes. “Certainly, <a href=\"http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/theres-a-reason-i-use-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analyses/\"><u>individual studies</u></a> have found that to be the case, and these are sometimes highlighted by the news media. But in the aggregate, most of these negative outcomes disappear.”</p>\n<p>In a 2012 meta-analysis — a systemic and statistical method of combining results from multiple studies — looked at the risks of drinking coffee on heart disease. In this study, habitual consumption was associated with a lowered risk, with the lowest risk found for those who had at least four cups a day. In another analysis of eleven studies which related coffee consumption to stroke incidence, those who consumed two to six cups a day had a lowered risk when compared to those who had none.</p>\n<p>In the area of cancer, the upshot is similar. A meta-analysis published in 2007 related two cups of coffee a day to a 40 percent less incidence of liver cancer. In the higher-quality studies of another meta-analysis involving prostate and breast cancer, no negative association to coffee consumption was found. Furthermore, in a study looking at all cancers, a lower general incidence of malignancy was associated with drinking coffee, with more protection seen in the more you drank. This pattern was similar in a recent systemic review of type II diabetes, compiling 26 studies and over 1.1 million participants, with up to a one-third reduction in type II diabetes in those who drank six to seven cups a day.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t end there either. The most recent meta-analyses of neurological diseases found an association between drinking coffee and a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease, age-related cognitive decline and even protection from Alzheimer’s.</p>\n<p>There is a catch, however, so don’t go running for that venti vanilla mocha latte every day. “Of course, everything I’m saying here concerns coffee — black coffee,” Carroll writes. “I am not talking about the mostly milk-and-sugar coffee-based beverages that a lot of people consume.”</p>\n<p>What about tea? <a href=\"http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/rob-van-dam/\">Dr. Rob van Dam</a>, assistant professor in the Dept. of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, summarizes his knowledge about the benefits of caffeine in an article on the department’s webpage. “Research on tea in the U.S. has not shown the type of beneficial effect we see for coffee,” van Dam said. “Probably because people in the U.S. tend to drink tea that is weaker in strength and tend to drink less of it.”</p>\n<p>So let out the word, indulge and tell your friend to not kick the habit anytime soon. “It’s a completely reasonable addition to a healthy diet,” Carroll writes. “It’s time we start treating it as such.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63646\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/coffee-addicts-rejoice/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63646\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/coffee-addicts-rejoice/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/coffee-addicts-rejoice/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/coffee-addicts-rejoice/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-21/coffee-addicts-rejoice/","id":7867,"author":{"id":1036,"name":"Erendira Garcia"},"related":[7866,7865,7864],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/1036"}},"__N_SSG":true}
