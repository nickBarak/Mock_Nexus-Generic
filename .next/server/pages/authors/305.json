His athleticism was evident even then, with a recorded 10.68 100m time in his senior year track season as well as his 35-plus-inch vertical leap.</p>\n<p>“It was tough and a big learning curve,” Azu-Irondi admitted. “It was good, though; I made some cool friends and learned a lot. As a little freshman coming in and playing football at a D-I university, it was tough but it was fun.”</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi floundered in the transition to college football, though, as he redshirted his first year before transferring to his hometown community college, College of the Canyons, to live closer to his family and try to get back to a four-year university as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>“At College of the Canyons I was doing my best to get out with a scholarship, but things weren’t working out, but I was still fast, you know?” Azu-Irondi laughed. “So during track season, I did what I could and did my own recruiting.”</p>\n<p>After three back-and-forths with Coach Anderson, a former sprinter at Oregon, the prospective Canyon transfer was left wondering about his future and searched everywhere for a new track home. Finally, in the summer of 2015, Azu-Irondi sent an email asking if UCSB was still interested, and his new coach responded saying that he’d be a Gaucho in the fall.</p>\n<p>An ankle injury kept him sidelined for the vast majority of his first year in Santa Barbara, but Azu-Irondi chugged through this rough patch, biding his time for a historic return.</p>\n<p>“When I kicked it on around the 15-meter mark, I made up for it,” Azu-Irondi recalled of his historic dash at UC San Diego two weeks ago. “My turnover came in, not as fast as Coach has seen me or I had wanted it, but once I turned it on, I stayed strong even though I was a little tense after having to catch up from the slow start.”</p>\n<p>“It was a solid race. I’d say like a seven out of 10.”</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi speaks so humbly of his 100m time, but when 10.55s flashed on the scoreboard next to his name, the San Fernando native solidified his place in the UCSB record books as the fastest man in school history — just barely beating Sandy Combs’s 30-year-old record of 10.56s.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he prefers to keep a low profile while he sends waves nationwide during his first D-I track season. But as every great runner knows, it takes a bit of arrogance to succeed on the track, and even Azu-Irondi, after enough prodding, confidently declared his goal for the season, which is as grand a goal as a college sprinter can have.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna be in the World Championships in London. I have to hit a 10.12 to get to the trials and then go from there. I don’t want to jinx it, but I could see myself doing some crazy things. Especially with the help of Coach Anderson, I’m gonna get there for sure.”</p>\n<p>A bold benchmark to set for oneself, undoubtedly, but everything about Azu-Irondi is bold. He walks around the track with his chest out and a massive smile on his face and proceeds to leave the audience stunned with his smooth stride and blazing speed. His confidence can be seen in his step, but it is partnered with a hard-working, humble upbringing that clearly has the sprinter prepped for great success.</p>\n<p>Azu-Irondi is just getting started, too. With a season and a half left in his collegiate track career, who knows? Maybe he’ll leave UCSB with the 10 fastest 100m marks in school history. Every personal record will be a school record, and time is on his hands.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 and 9 of the April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus</p><div

The rest of the events, including the sprints and jumps, will be decided Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>The meet featured three Big West teams last year and will likely be UCSB’s Head Coach Pete Dolan’s first up-close look at a couple of rival teams the Gauchos will face as the year progresses.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Dolan has his athletes primed for a memorable season for the program and expressed his delight with the veterans’ leadership and poise as well as the underclassmen’s hunger for success following Santa Barbara’s domination of UCI and UCSD last weekend.</p>\n<p>In the sprints, junior Sike Azu-Irondi will look to build on his UCSB record-setting dash in the 100 m just five days ago. He hadn’t told anybody heading into the meet, but he had been planning on running faster than the 10.56 s record Sandy Combs set 30 years ago.</p>\n<p>He managed to do just that, shaving a hundredth of a second from the record and claiming it for himself in his first race of the year, a statement he’ll want to follow with a string of equally impressive races in upcoming weeks to establish himself as the unequivocal best sprinter in school history.</p>\n<p>In the throws, UCSB enters the meet having recorded marks this season that could’ve won every event among D-I athletes at last year’s edition of CSUF’s invitational, which also features several professional SoCal track and field athletes looking to get early season race experience.</p>\n<p>Former Gaucho Thomas Gore-Schreck won the javelin at the 2016 Ben Brown with a 63.77 m toss, the event he holds the program record in with 10 feet of breathing room.</p>\n<p>Current senior Matthew Kuskey, who sits sixth in UCSB history in the event, will like his chances to take the crown this weekend with a 54 m throw last week, higher than any collegiate competitors that finished below Gore-Schreck.</p>\n<p>Junior thrower Kordell Hampton enters the meet with an 8 m edge on his longest throw over last year’s winner after breaking the UCSB record in the discus at the All-UC Meet with a 178’ bomb.</p>\n<p>“Kordell and Stephen [Leach] traded the lead throughout the discus competition, with Stephen throwing 172′ 6 in the last round to take the lead,” said Throws/Multis Coach Cody Fleming. “Kordell was the only thrower left and he nailed it. I think Stephen woke him up a little bit. It’s always cool for me to see teammates pushing each other like that and each coming out with new PRs.”</p>\n<p>Junior Kayla Thayer has a solid chance at attaining first place in the women’s shot put, with her season best of 43′ 6.5” giving her about a three-inch buffer from last year’s winner at Ben Brown. Senior Valerie Nestor should also be able to threaten the top in the hammer after her 56.16 m throw last week.</p>\n<p>Both the men’s and women’s throwing teams have proven early on in the outdoor season that they will be a force all year, with multiple throwers in each event capable of a podium-worthy throw amongst Big West competition.</p>\n<p>Junior Jenna Hinkle (mile and 3000 m) and senior Adam Avila (steeple) will be among the fastest in the collegiate field, hoping to repeat their individual wins last week in their respective events, leading the distance squad to Fullerton.</p>\n<p>The meet begins at 10 a.m. on Friday, March 9, at the Titan Track complex at Cal State Fullerton, and resumes the next day at 9 a.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Azu-Irondi also picked up the meet record for his efforts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Kordell Hampton followed suit in the men’s discus, and broke Mike Wimmer’s 33-year-old record by an inch, launching his first toss of the event 178 feet, over eight feet farther than his previous personal best.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wilmer’s mark was the joint-fourth-oldest record in program history.

The first meet was a smaller practice meet, but this was our first chance to set precedent for rest of season.

She has now finished first in her last four races, including the mile and 3000m at the Gaucho Round-Up a week ago. </span></p>\n<p>“It was obviously a great opener for me, but it was my first 1500m of the year so it was a good gauge of what kind of shape I’m in at this point in the season,” Hinkle said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the trend of record-breaking season debuts, Adam Avila’s outdoor season start couldn’t have gone better, breaking a 15-year-old meet record in the men’s 3000m steeplechase in 9:00.20, which cracks him into the top-10 in the program’s all-time list to cap off the Gauchos’ historic performance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the women’s sprints, the Gauchos dominated the field, with Morgan Simpson grabbing wins in the 200m and 400m with times of 25.80 and 56.91, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Senior Shannon Trumbull grabbed a double of her own in the 100m hurdles and 400m hurdles 13.95 and 1:01.43, respectively, with a noticeable gap between her and the second-place runner in each event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Jazmin Moss did her usual thing in the women’s jumps, earning two first place finishes with marks of 17′ 11.75” in the long jump and 38′ 0.25” in the triple. On the men’s side of the jumps, junior Jeff Lam managed a more unorthodox double.

Azu-Irondi also ran the first leg of the men’s 4x400m relay, with the Gaucho foursome finishing first in an impressive 3:26.47.</p>\n<p>Junior Jenna Hinkle placed first in the women’s mile, dominating the field in a blistering 4:54.60, only to come back and repeat in the 3000m in 9:47.00, 10th on UCSB’s all-time list. Senior Adam Avila also had a great race in the men’s 3000m, finishing in 8:35.60 in his first race back from an All-Region XC season.</p>\n<p>Senior Tori Usgaard and sophomore Jazmin Moss — who were perhaps the most successful UCSB athletes for the brief indoor season — continued their great run of jumps. Usgaard reached 18’10.75″ in the women’s long jump to claim first place, a new PR, and Moss, in addition to her leg on the victorious 4x100m relay, won the women’s triple with a 38’3.25″ mark.</p>\n<p>In the throws, senior Matthew Kuskey threw 225’8.5” in the javelin to win the event and climb to second on UCSB’s all-time list in the new-style javelin. The senior also threw the fifth-longest in school history with a throw of 222’0″ last year, and he will be hoping to make enough improvement over the course of the year to threaten Thomas Gore-Schreck’s program record of 234’3”.</p>\n<p>Apart from the women’s javelin, the Gauchos won every throwing event. Junior Kayla Thayer succeeded in the women’s discus with a throw of 139’5.0″ and junior Kordell Hampton won on the men’s side at 164’10.5’</p>\n<p>Senior Valerie Nestor was victorious in the hammer with a bomb of 172’5.25” and senior Stephen Leach claimed first with a mark of 184’8.0″ in the men’s.</p>\n<p>As a cherry on top, Thayer and Leach each finished first in the men’s and women’s shot put, respectively. Thayer’s 43’5.0” mark was good enough for her second win of the day, and it took Leach a 51’6.5” toss to follow suit.</p>\n<p>“This was the best roundup I think I’ve witnessed for my group,” said Associate Head Coach Cody Fleming of the throwers, the group of athletes he works with in training.</p>\n<p>In last year’s All-UC Meet, the Gauchos lost in heartbreaking fashion, with the meet undecided until the last relay and UCSB finishing second by just one point. With a win in their pockets at the first outdoor meet of the year, Head Coach Pete Dolan will be hoping his team can repeat its Roundup success and string together a couple of strong showings that could set the foundation for a really impressive year.</p>\n<p>The All-UC meet will begin on Saturday, March 4 at the Triton Track &amp; Field Stadium.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76115\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76115\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/track-and-field-resumes-season-at-all-uc-invite/","id":5703,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5702,5701,5700],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Track and Field Comes Home to Host Gaucho Round Up","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Track and Field","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Track_4-2-16_1-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChristinaDeMarzo_Track_4-2-16_1-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Getting their first taste of home this weekend, both the UCSB women's and men's track and field teams will compete in the program's annual Gaucho Round Up event this Saturday at Westmont College.

She also posted a respectable 17’6” in the long jump.</p>\n<p>With Peng and Moss so close in level, the teammates’ friendly competition will help the two develop with more meaningful dual meets and conference meets about a month away.</p>\n<p>In the high jump, UCSB had three top-10 finishers, with junior Hannah O’Connor and freshmen Natalie Aldrich and Aine McNulty all tying for sixth place, jumping 1.56m respectively.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also improved as a team in the throws from their last meet, with senior Valerie Nestor cracking the top five in the weight throw with an impressive 50-plus-foot throw (15.82m). Junior Kayla Thayer was the second-highest finisher in the event for UCSB in 12th at 14.71m.</p>\n<p>Thayer also recorded a team-best shot put mark of 13.02m, the only Gaucho over 13m, good enough for eighth place. Sophomore Samantha Ruggles was right behind her, though, finishing ninth with a 12.67m toss.</p>\n<p>With the Gauchos ready to host their outdoor season warmup meet at neighboring Westmont College, the women’s track and field athletes will feel good with their level of fitness and training at this point in the year, and improvements are sure to come.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75785\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-track-and-field-comes-home-to-host-gaucho-round-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75785\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-track-and-field-comes-home-to-host-gaucho-round-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-track-and-field-comes-home-to-host-gaucho-round-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-track-and-field-comes-home-to-host-gaucho-round-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/ucsb-track-and-field-comes-home-to-host-gaucho-round-up/","id":5694,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[5693,5692,5691],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Nick DePuy’s Possible Impact in Montreal","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-12-at-12.54.55-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-shot-2017-02-12-at-12.54.55-PM.png?resize=737%2C402&ssl=1","description":"After a historic four-year career as a UCSB Gaucho, former men's soccer star Nick DePuy is turning his dreams into a reality after being drafted by the Montreal Impact.

On draft day, DePuy dropped to the 19th pick, but couldn’t have landed in a better MLS setup than the Montreal Impact’s.</p>\n<p>The two parties have the potential to be a perfect fit, with style of play and current squad being the two leading factors in DePuy’s chance to make an immediate contribution to an already title-contending roster. Montreal is a well-organized team that loves to break forward quickly through the wings, much like UCSB, and despite his professional inexperience, the Irvine native will enter the league as one of the premier physical forces.</p>\n<p>In a Florida training camp friendly last week, the former Gaucho scored both goals in the Impact’s 2-0 win over University of Southern Florida, with his strikes assisted by first team regulars Dominic Oduro and Patrice Bernier. Within weeks, the striker has impressed alongside Montreal’s best players — a good sign signs this far into his infant career.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>(Fast forward to 0:55 for DePuy snippet):</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKaZILxZB1I?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Towering at 6’5” with a sturdy frame and a decent leap in him, DePuy has always been able to establish him as a presence around the goal: able to sniff out chances with both feet, and more notably, his head. The frontman was always able to find chances for himself in college, averaging 30 goals in 55 appearances after Gaucho Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg permanently switched the then-midfielder to the team’s lone striker midway through DePuy’s sophomore year.</p>\n<p>The Impact’s first-round pick joins a team that lost in extra time in the playoff semifinals against rivals Toronto FC; the former two-time all-American and three-time Big West offensive Player of the Year is lucky enough to ply his trade up top with the service of some of the best international stars in the league.</p>\n<p>Midfielder Ignacio Piatti of Argentina was tied for fourth in the MLS with 17 goals, to go with a team-high six assists, establishing himself as Montreal’s most creative attacking player in a forward-minded midfield role. Ghanaian right winger Oduro is the team’s biggest wide threat, scoring six goals while tying Piatti with six assists, and assisted on DePuy’s first goal against USF with a nice cutback pass. On the left, wingback Ambroise Oyongo returns to the Impact fresh off winning an African Cup of Nations title with Cameroon, playing every minute of the tournament and establishing himself as one of his nation’s very best defensive options.</p>\n<p>If DePuy is able to earn himself chances in the first team, there won’t be a shortage of delivery from Montreal’s best servicemen, and by looking at the team’s apparent lack of squad depth at striker, the chances could very well be there for the rookie hitman. With Ivory Coast legend Didier Drogba’s departure (and most likely retirement) at the end of his 10-goal, six-assist season last year, the team lost in him its most reliable forward and only has a combined 14 league goals last year from forwards still on the roster.</p>\n<p>DePuy’s direct competition for playing time will be Matteo Mancosu, who led returning forwards with seven goals after joining the team in July last year on a year-long loan from Italian side Bologna. Although the Italian will most likely be the first-choice striker at the start of the MLS season next month, it wouldn’t be too unreasonable to expect a similar goal return from a player of DePuy’s poaching prowess.</p>\n<p>The Santa Barbara legend proved himself in Vom Steeg’s system as a superb holdup play outlet in the middle of the park, distributing to the team’s skillful attacking players, much like Drogba’s role in last year’s Montreal side; the former Gaucho’s work rate in the press is noticeable as well, often times nicking the ball away from defenders in advanced positions. DePuy also scores around half of his goals from headers, and with height and athleticism to match up against the MLS’s biggest defenders, his skill set seems like it could translate seamlessly into Head Coach Mauro Biello’s attack.</p>\n<p>The Impact’s season begins March 4 on the road against the San Jose Earthquakes, and although it’s highly unlikely to see DePuy play significant minutes, he could end up being picked for the bench as a second-choice striker.

freshmen and two transfers to bolster his roster after the departure of key players like striker Nick DePuy, midfielder Josue España, and midfielder Andy Perez.</p>\n<p>Four of the freshmen are nationally ranked, including the mercurial attacker Kaya Fabretti  — No. 22 National (College Soccer News), No. 4 Northern California Region (Top Drawer) — and the solid defender Omari Fontes — No. 79 National, No. 6 Northern California, No. 22 Defender (Top Drawer).</p>\n<p>With Vom Steeg bringing in some of the most sought after prospects from the U.S. and abroad — along with his history of giving young talents early chances in their college career — the last two recruiting classes could set up the program with some of its strongest-ever teams in the upcoming years.</p><!--Ad

of the development program’s most promising prospects. Fontes played two seasons with the San Juan Academy before moving to the Sac Republic Academy, helping his team qualify for the youth playoffs in its inaugural season.</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg has raving reviews of both players, “anticipating that [Fabretti] will be able to contribute assists and goals even as a freshman,” and also believes that Fontes “will really take off when he enters [UCSB’s] program” due to his excellent composure and knowledge of the game.</p>\n<p>In addition to Sac Republic FC product, the Gauchos’ head coach focused heavily on bolstering the team’s defensive depth, adding another four defenders and a goalkeeper. Incoming freshmen Kavian Kashani, a center back, and Rhys Pak, a right back, both played for two of the top academies in California, the Orange County SC and the De Anza Force Academy, respectively. Vom Steeg said he believes both players can become two of the program’s best defenders.</p>\n<p>Goalkeeper Ricardo Montoy will be transferring from Taft College as an incoming junior to bring more competition to the position after allowing just 16 goals in 24 games last season, including 14 clean sheets and a Conference Goalkeeper of the Year award.</p>\n<p>The final California-recruited defender is Giovanny Acosta — who won three national championships with local Santa Barbara Soccer Club, most recently in 2016 —  will likely deputize for last year’s starting left back Randy Mendoza, a senior next season.</p>\n<p>Acosta’s club teammate, forward Rodney Michael, will also make the transition to UCSB; the creative forward scored 62 high school goals and won a CIF title within three years of moving to the U.S. from Sierra Leone, as well as being named to the U-18 National Championships Best-XI when he starred in SBSC’s winning run.</p>\n<p>Midfielder Hanno Antoni of Mannheim, Germany is one of two international recruits of the Gauchos’ 2017 class. Antoni is a transfer from Berry College, where he was named to the Division II First Team All-American team last season after leading his league with 13 goals and four assists. By recruiting Antoni, Vom Steeg is expecting to add goals and experience to a midfield already dominated by Big West Midfielder of the Year Kevin Feucht.</p>\n<p>Antoni is joined by international recruit 17-year-old Pablo Adrian Adames, who is coming to play for UCSB from Santutxu FC Juvenil B in his hometown of Bilbao, Spain. While in Spain, the center back played in the National League, the country’s second-best youth league.</p>\n<p>Much like center back/defensive mid-Daniel Amo, a freshman last season, Adames seems like a defender who will fit into the attacking-minded style the Gauchos prefer.</p>\n<p>After watching five freshmen — Noah Billingsley, Daniel Amo, Titouan Le Roux, Lamar Batista and Mateo Restrepo Mejia — all cement their rightful spots in Vom Steeg’s rotation last season, it’s fair to expect the same from this year’s class, which appears to feature an equally impressive level of quality. Hopefully, they will build up the program for the future, as the veteran head coach has made a habit of in his 18-year UCSB career.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of

As for Moss, any mark close to her season best of 11.60m will have a great chance of finishing first, as last year’s meet winner only managed 10.70m.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>As for Moss, any mark close to her season best of 11.60m will have a great chance of finishing first, as last year’s meet winner only managed 10.70m.</p>\n<p>The women long jumpers enter the meet with lofty ambitions this year after managing three finishers in the top eight at the Bronco Invite.

The Titans will hope to secure their third straight conference title.</p>\n<p>After a slow start to the match, CSUF started to grab a hold of the tempo and was quickly rewarded for its early energy when freshman forward Rei Dorwart’s sweetly struck effort found the top-right corner to give the visitors a 1-0 lead in the match’s ninth minute.</p>\n<p>The Titans maintained control throughout the majority of the first half, limiting the Gauchos’ potent attack to just three shots. The top seeded Gauchos entered the half down 1-0, struggling to create anything up front.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t get to enough balls first tonight,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Like everything else, we’ve got a long offseason to look at that. We discussed this all year, and this is the first UCSB team in some time that had no wide play on either side.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton struck almost immediately at the start of the second half when a poor UCSB clearance bounced to Fullerton’s sophomore midfielder Ross McPhie.</p>\n<p>McPhie capitalized on the possession when his low shot rolled to the right of UCSB goalkeeper Brandon Berke for the score to double Fullerton’s lead to 2-0. The second goal forced the Gauchos to pick up the pace for the last 43 minutes, but the Titans’ conference-best defense was up to the test.</p>\n<p>After several scoring opportunities and corner kicks, UCSB reached the back of the net in the 64th minute when freshman winger Noah Billingsley beat his man down the flank before firing in a hard low ball across the face of the goal post, in which Feucht was there to pounce on the chance.</p>\n<p>For the next 15 minutes, the Gauchos controlled the pace of play and looked likely to score, but were unable to find the equalizer.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Josue España, who had been playing with a slight knee injury since the first Cal Poly game, looked to be reinjured after a hard challenge on the counter.</p>\n<p>Although he returned for five minutes, the team’s assist leader garnering seven assists had to come out early in the last game of his impressive two-year stay at Harder. Playing through injury, the senior managed to bring the home crowd to its feet on several occasions with his flicks and tricks before his exit.</p>\n<p>España and Billingsley looked the most likely to create the game-tying chance, and the latter came within inches as his header from the middle of the box slipped just left of the frame.</p>\n<p>Feucht and Big West Offensive Player of the Year senior forward Nick DePuy each led the Gauchos with three shots, but Fullerton eventually regained control for the final 10 minutes to see out their second straight postseason victory at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“DePuy has had a great four years, three-time Big West Offensive Player of the year, but I think the one player that kind of drove our team and made so much happen for us was Josue,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>An All-Big West First Team selection in 2015, España provided another dynamic to the Gauchos’ gameplan in his ability to play both on and off the ball.</p>\n<p>“We wish he could’ve come as a freshman but we got him for two years, and you’ll take what you get,” Vom Steeg said. “From that Cal Poly game and on, he has been giving us what he can, but it’s just not 100 percent.

UCSB was the most represented side in the league in the regular season awards.</p>\n<p>“It shows that we have strong players and a quality team,” Feucht said. “It goes to show how much we’ve found each other this year, and we were unbeaten until the last game in conference so we’ve shown we’re a good team.”</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Cal State Fullerton had its fair share of match-winners too. Senior striker Alex Heilmann leads the Big West with 11 goals and was one of three Titans named to the All-Conference First and Second Teams. The other First Teamer, senior defender Ricardo Covarrubias, anchors the Big West’s best back line, as CSUF have allowed a measly 1.12 goals per game.</p>\n<p>The other First Teamer, senior defender Ricardo Covarrubias, anchors the Big West’s best back line, as CSUF have allowed a measly 1.12 goals per game.</p>\n<p>In hopes of countering the Titan’s sheisty defense, the Gauchos bring plenty of firepower up top, averaging 1.58 goals for almost 0.3 goals per game more than CSUN, the second most prolific offense in the conference.</p>\n<p>Much of the threat comes from the trio of Selemani having tallied seven goals, DePuy with six and Feucht rounding things out with 10, whose interchanging runs in the front have picked open Big West opposition all season long. España leads UCSB with seven assists.</p>\n<p>“You have to ask me after the game whether we’re the best offense or they’re the best defense,” Feucht said. “We have to play to find out.’</p>\n<p>When the two teams faced off earlier this season at Fullerton, the host gave the Gauchos a tough match, but the visitors ended up heading back to Santa Barbara with a 2-1 overtime win thanks to Kevin Feucht’s match winner on an assist from España. The Gauchos star-studded attack will pose the sternest test Fullerton has faced in weeks.</p>\n<p>As for injuries, all of the regulars are healthy for UCSB, and the highly promising freshman midfielder Daniel Amo, who has missed most of the season with a groin injury that he aggravated again at home against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Amo is hoping to fight back into the team as the postseason picks up. His injury against Poly was far less serious than his first setback of the year, keeping him out of training for a couple weeks, but the first-year product has a chance to come back into the squad in the next match.</p>\n<p>The semifinal will take place at Harder Stadium on Wednesday, Nov. 9 at 7 p.m. Follow <em>@thenexus_sports</em> for all things Gaucho soccer.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73936\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73936\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-07/ucsbs-postseason-begins-with-last-seasons-finals-rematch-against-csuf/","id":1412,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1411,1410,1409],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Clinches Big West North with 1-0 Win at Sac State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Now just one win away from ending the season with an undefeated Big West conference record, the UCSB men's soccer team got one step closer to the achievement in its 1-0 victory over the Sacramento Sta...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After failing to clinch the division last Saturday vs. Cal Poly in a defensive 0-0 draw, the UCSB men’s soccer team managed to achieve the feat Wednesday on the road as junior winger Ahinga Selemani’s 81st minute winner gave the Gauchos an edge to knock off the Hornets, 1-0, to clinch a seat at the conference semifinals.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66388\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66388\" data-attachment-id=\"66388\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/late-goal-springs-no-17-ucsb-to-big-west-final/mens_soccer_ucd_111115_eric_swenson_006-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mens_Soccer_UCD_111115_Eric_Swenson_006-web.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800E\",\"caption\":\"Ahinga Selemani crosses the ball in for an unsuccessful attempt on goal.

The Hornets clinched second place in the North as UC Davis lost to Cal Poly 2-1 in OT on Wednesday.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We’re just really happy to finally get our first trophy,” Selemani said. “It’s very rewarding because we put in a lot of work this year but we’re just happy.”</p>\n<p>At halftime, both sides seemed comfortable with the 0-0 scoreline. With zero shots on goal recorded in the first period, the second half marked the Hornets attempt to come out playing like a team that had to win to keep their division title hopes alive.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos broke the deadlock, though, when sophomore defender Jan Ilskens recorded the first point of his collegiate career when he found Selemani at the top of the box, who drilled his left-footed shot into the top right corner for the winger’s fourth game winner of the season.</p>\n<p>After the visitors took the lead, Sac State turned it up a notch, creating several great chances in the final 10 minutes. However, it was unable to find the equalizer in the end, thanks to a solid team performance by the UCSB defense.</p>\n<p>Playing without starting junior fullback Randy Mendoza (yellow cards) and freshman midfielder Daniel Amo, who once again aggravated his groin injury against Cal Poly, it seemed plausible that the Gauchos would be at a disadvantage. However, freshmen Lamar Batista and Kyle Perno filled in the gaps with aplomb on the offensive end in a season-defining match.</p>\n<p>“That was a huge challenge of ours, and in the early season we had a hard time finishing games and unfortunately dropped a lot of points,” Selemani said. “Mentally, we locked in. We’re a lot more focused now, and you can tell that everyone’s aware when the clock is ticking in the dying moments, so I think we’re doing a better job now.”</p>\n<p>Le Roux made sure the Gauchos held onto their one-goal lead in the final minutes with a few clearances and saves to improve his scoreless run in goal to a season-long 285:22 minutes. The true freshman from Paris has been a revelation in his debut season, leading the NCAA with 1698:12 minutes, and the goalkeeper hasn’t missed a single second of game time.</p>\n<p>Selemani’s strike in the 81st was his seventh of the season, placing him second on the team and third in the conference. Since the start of Big West play, the Ann Arbor native has the most goals in Big West play with five in the last nine matches. The Gaucho attack has been well balanced all year with three players in the top five of Big West goal scorers with junior midfielder Kevin Feucht atop the charts with 10 goals and senior striker Nick DePuy tied for fifth with six.</p>\n<p>“It’s been exciting taking on a new role, and it all comes from practicing in the offseason, taking shot after shot, so finally getting results has been good,” Selemani said. “We’ve been playing well together, and everyone is finding one another, and we’ve found a way to get the offense going.”</p>\n<p>DePuy’s 15 goals last season — the top in the nation during the regular season — made up just over 35 percent of the team’s goals. However, this year, that figure has dropped to around 20 percent thanks to the telling contributions from elsewhere in the attack.</p>\n<p>As DePuy’s unlucky recent goal drought continues with the forward having just one goal in the team’s last eight matches, Feucht, Selemani and company have picked up the slack as the Gauchos’ unbeaten streak in conference is one game away from ending in an undefeated Big West season.</p>\n<p>Next up for UCSB is the last home game of the season Sunday against UC Davis. The match will be played at Harder Stadium at 2 p.m., the team’s last game before beginning its postseason run with a Big West semifinal on Nov. 9.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73573\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73573\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-28/ucsb-clinches-big-west-north-with-1-0-win-at-sac-state/","id":1408,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1407,1406,1405],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Hope to Avoid Being Stung by Hornets","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccerVSSacState20151028-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MSoccerVSSacState20151028-JennyLuo-06-web.jpg?resize=600%2C400&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos looking to clinch North Big West division in final road match of the season this Wednesday.

The German has been the driving force in the middle of the park for the Gauchos, popping up in all the right areas with an engine-like work-rate.</p>\n<p>The trio of DePuy, Feucht and Selemani has been stellar to say the least as each player ranks top-5 in the conference for goals.</p>\n<p>However, after forcing a draw at Harder Stadium the last time it met UCSB, Sac State will like their chances with the division leaders coming to town. The Hornets got their first point at UCSB since the Tim Vom Steeg era took over back in 1999, while also halting the Gauchos’ then three-game winning streak.</p>\n<p>As things stand, the Hornets look likely to find their way into Big West playoffs, and could pull off a shocking division title with a win in their next two matches along with the help of two Santa Barbara losses this weekend.</p>\n<p>That being said, it’s a tall task considering how UCSB has tightened up in the back in recent weeks and has seemingly found the formula of fighting through tough games to get positive results.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have played five overtime matches in league thus far — posting a 2-0-3 record in those matches — and although the long games might take a bit of a physical toll, the side will be one of the most tested teams around come postseason play.</p>\n<p>Following their five-game losing streak, Vom Steeg’s men have yet to lose and, despite dropping out of the Coaches’ Poll after peaking as high as No. 4, have managed to climb their way back into the conversation, receiving a vote for the first time in nearly a month and a half.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, six players will be honored at Senior Night for the outgoing class’ final home game of the regular season. DePuy; senior midfielders Seo-In Kim, Josue España and Riley Peterson; and senior defenders Andy Perez and Josue Salgado will all be hoping to end their final season with a postseason run.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s match will be played against Sac State at 3 p.m. at Hornet Soccer Field.</p>\n<p>The senior day battle against UC Davis will take place on Sunday, Oct. 30, at Harder Stadium

The home fans were rocking, but Santa Barbara couldn’t find a winning goal as the game played out to a 0-0 stalemate following overtime.</p>\n<p>UCSB remains atop the North division with the result at 5-0-3 in Big West play, 9-5-3 overall, five points clear of second-place Sac State, and although the home side failed to clinch the North with a win over the Mustangs, a tie in either of SB’s last two regular season games would essentially clinch the title. As for the Mustangs, the tie leaves the squad at the bottom of the division at 1-5-2 in conference play while standing them at 3-9-3 overall.</p>\n<p>The 11,424 in attendance at Harder made up the largest crowd in the country this season for a men’s soccer game, and the rivalry is now responsible for drawing 15 of the 20 largest regular season crowds in NCAA soccer. Early on, the atmosphere was deafening, students packing the main grandstand to the brim, but as the game played out, both teams settled into what would become a dirty, defensive battle.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The visitors seemed to have opened the scoring in the 15th minute when Cal Poly senior defender Kody Wakasa directed the ball past freshman keeper Titouan Le Roux with his right hand and was shown the match’s first yellow for the blatant hand ball.</p>\n<p>After that, the Gauchos were able to create several chances through crosses from the wingers and fullbacks, coming closest in the 22nd minute as senior striker Nick DePuy smashed his towering header off the crossbar and back into play, but no teammates were around before the Mustang defense was able to clear their line.</p>\n<p>The All-American striker was hugely involved in his team’s best chances, including a team-high five shots. Despite his recent scoring troubles, DePuy has been doing everything to get on the scoresheet and is tied for second on the team with six goals this year. His recent dry spell — one goal in last seven matches — even left his teammates and coaches wishing a bit of luck on the frontman.</p>\n<p>“The streak is at eight now. Nick’s hit the post on a header in eight straight games and he did it again tonight,” said Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg half-jokingly. “He’s still getting up and battling for that ball, but it’s just one of those unlucky streaks where he keeps finding the post, and tonight that’s the goal that opens up the whole game. Unfortunate, but Nick played very, very well tonight.”</p>\n<p>UCSB dominated the match, holding Cal Poly to just one shot in each half, but the Gaucho attack failed to find a goal as it pressed on in the second half and overtime. The Mustangs stacked all but one man behind the ball for the last forty minutes, including OT. Santa Barbara outshot the visitors 10-2, but were ultimately held scoreless for the first time in eleven games.</p>\n<p>The meeting was highly contested with 35 total fouls, and each team had at least two valid penalty claims that were waived on by the referee. In the postgame press conference, Vom Steeg said the allowance of overly physical play made it too difficult for either team to score, and ultimately Poly stayed resolute in the back, earning a tie at Harder for the second straight year.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to generate an attack when they can physically hold you back,” said Vom Steeg. “Nick played great tonight considering its two arms around his waist wrapped up so you can’t get free. You can’t get open in that box because at some point you realize there won’t be a call.”</p>\n<p>Having just beaten Cal Poly on the road last weekend, SB planned on wearing out the Mustangs and taking the game late, and while the coaching staff must have been pleased with how their game plan played out, the offense couldn’t find the moment it needed to break the deadlock. A win would’ve clinched the Big West North for the reigning division champs, but the Gauchos were unable to find the winner and are now forced to grab a positive result this week in order to lock up at least one home game for conference playoffs.</p>\n<p>“It would’ve been nice to get the title in front of the crowd, but the team played really well,” said junior midfielder Kevin Feucht, who leads UCSB with 10 goals. “If you play five more minutes we find the goal. At the end they were split up and sliding all over the field, so if we had one final shot, one final pass, we could’ve got the win.”</p>\n<p>The biggest crowd of the year brought an electric energy to the rivalry match, but the game never opened up enough to do the nationally-televised meeting justice, as both teams locked up the opposing attackers and played out the Blue-Green rivalry’s first scoreless draw since 2009.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">SCENES IN THE 15th MINUTE 0-0 STILL IN THE BLUE/GREEN RIVALRY <a href=\"https://t.co/EU178e6k3G\">pic.twitter.com/EU178e6k3G</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus Sports (@thenexus_sports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thenexus_sports/status/790030498114392064\">October 23, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>UCSB’s next match is at Sac St. on Wednesday, October 26 at 3 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73397\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73397\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-23/gauchos-and-mustangs-duel-ends-in-draw/","id":1401,"author":{"id":305,"name":"Ryan Burns"},"related":[1400,1399,1398],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Settling In: Gaucho Freshmen Class Solidifies International Flair","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2016-10-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"There are a total of 29 international student athletes from every corner of the globe playing Big West soccer, and UCSB has nine, tied for the most in the conference with CSUN.

The heavily international roster creates a dynamic that most other collegiate programs are never exposed to.</p>\n<p>When high school seniors commit their futures to college programs, they look for places that promote a preferred style of play or mentality, and it seems that Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has fostered an environment that looks extremely appealing to kids from overseas. Six of the nine freshmen on the current Gaucho roster joined from a range of nations outside the United States.</p>\n<p>Just this week, four of the first-year internationals were listed to the TopDrawerSoccers.com midseason Top-200 Freshman list. Midfielder Daniel Amo (Ghana), fullback Mateo Restrepo Mejia (Canada), winger Noah Billingsley (New Zealand) and goalkeeper Titouan Le Roux (France) are the quartet of top prospects. Amo is the highest ranked at No. 20 on the list and the other three all have experience in the youth setups of their respective national teams.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<div id=\"attachment_73428\" style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73428\" data-attachment-id=\"73428\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-21/settling-in-gaucho-freshman-class-solidifies-international-flair/titouan-le-roux-clears-the-ball-eric-swenson-daily-nexus/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-22-MSoccer-SLO-EricSwensonNexus-3-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1602\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Titouan Le Roux clears the ball.

Mejia has started five matches, but has appeared in every game, serving in countless crosses in his wing-back role.</p>\n<p>“When I came here it was with the objective of playing, so I was ready to play and ready to do everything,” Le Roux said. “It’s my job to play, so I’m glad to be the starting goalkeeper, and I want to keep playing so I keep trying to do my best to keep playing.”</p>\n<p>Billingsley, who played at the U-20s World Cup two years ago for the New Zealand side, has become a key piece of UCSB’s marauding attack, with two goals and two assists.<br>\nTo the credit of his growth over the year, the winger’s dribbling and passing behind striker Nick DePuy has been increasingly noticeable as the year goes on as he grows into his starting role.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73431\" style=\"width: 569px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73431\" data-attachment-id=\"73431\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-21/settling-in-gaucho-freshman-class-solidifies-international-flair/dustin-harris-daily-nexus-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=2400%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2400,1600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-73431\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web-1024x683.jpg?resize=559%2C374\" alt=\"Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus\" width=\"559\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MSoc_vsCalPoly-161022-DustinHarris-03-web.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-73431\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Amo’s injury forced him to endure a testing month of recovery as the promising midfielder eagerly worked his way back into training. His rehab has almost paid its dividends as he prepares to make a brief cameo in Saturday’s home leg of the Blue-Green rivalry.</p>\n<p>“It was frustrating and it hurts, but, I mean, it’s part of the game. But my teammates were right there, very supportive, so I never thought ‘I’m done,’” Amo said. ”They were always there reminding me, like, ‘Oh, you gotta go to rehab.’ The guys were all supportive, so it made it — I wouldn’t say okay because it’s still an injury — but they made it comfortable to be around and go to the games.”</p>\n<p>In his time out, the Accra, Ghana native credited the team’s welcoming and supportive team spirit with helping him through the recovery process. One teammate Amo thanked specifically was senior midfielder Seo-In Kim, who was recovering from a long-term injury alongside him.</p>\n<p>The two spent hours in the gym together fighting back to full strength, and now that both players are back in the rotation, Amo and Kim will get to play together for the first time at some point during the last few games of conference play.</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing to see Seo get ready to play because when I got here I didn’t get to see him play, so I wanted to see him play,” Amo said. “He had a lot of sessions with me and I was like, ‘Oh my god, I want to see Seo play.’ This weekend at Cal Poly we were just knocking the ball around and it made me so excited to have him on the field.”</p>\n<p>The relationship between the Ghanaian and Kim, a midfielder born in South Korea before moving to the States, goes to show how UCSB’s soccer program has become a place for multicultural interaction with one of the most diverse squads in the country.</p>\n<p>It’s become a place where student-athletes from every possible background get to collaborate, and Billingsley commented on how joining up with players from so many cultures even shows in the way the Gauchos play.</p>\n<p>“Almost half of our team are from other places in the world, so everyone gets along and there’s no cliques, which is nice,” Billingsley explained. “Everyone is used to a different style of play and comes from different backgrounds, and I think the chemistry is just right, and that alone has won us a couple of games.”</p>\n<p>Vom Steeg’s style of play, a high-pressing 4-3-3 with attacking wing backs, has allowed the German midfielder Kevin Feucht to shine this season — the junior leads the Big West with 10 goals — as the focal point of the Gauchos’ exciting offense that allows the creative players to express themselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the influence of already having upperclassmen foreign players on the team helping the younger guys adapt to the new pressures of college life and finding resources on campus, it’s clear how much these international athletes stick together.</p>\n<p>Le Roux mentioned the helpfulness of his teammates as he struggled with people “speaking too quick for me,” and the assistance extended to basic tasks associated with moving somewhere new.</p>\n<p>“The older guys know about stuff we have to go through, like getting a new phone plan and bank account and that sort of stuff, and then all the other things like being away from home; it’s really nice to have people there whenever I need to talk about something,” Billingsley said.</p>\n<p>The benefits of a multicultural presence extend beyond the lines of the field as players learn about and compare their teammates’ ways of life with one another.</p>\n<p>The Harder Stadium melting pot is a rare occurrence in college sports, and it is a premier example of the intrigue of diversity in soccer.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
