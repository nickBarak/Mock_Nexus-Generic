The staff referenced a Nov. 14 incident when the center’s associate director was fired and removed from the Student Resource Building without warning.</p>\n<p>The RCSGD was immediately removed from underneath its umbrella organization and the university administration agreed to a freestanding building that would house the new RCSGD, as well as several other demands that included a doubling of the program’s budget.</p>\n<p>The organization’s current name will be changed later this year.</p>\n<p>“The RCSGD title had previously fit the student body but may no longer accommodate the communities’ needs,” said Hikaru Ezra Mernin, the Transforce task coordinator.</p>\n<p>Mernin explained that it may be difficult for students to tell their friends or family members “I work at the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity,” which is why a slightly more ambiguous or “non-outing” title should be established.</p>\n<p>They also said that the lack of adequate assistance has made tasks “more complex” and has been “hindering the RCGSD’s progress.”</p>\n<p>Students also expressed concern about the graduate student hiring process. Many felt that undergraduates should be able to work with the administration to determine which candidates may be a good fit.</p>\n<p>RCSGD office manager Ogui Gonzalez said the “student voices are currently not centered and students should be able to put in their input and be involved in the interview process.”</p>\n<p>In addition to increased participation in the hiring process, students requested upperclassmen housing for queer and transgender students.</p>\n<p>Diversity Programs Director Carlos Nash said that this may be implemented in the future because the housing faculty members are already planning to incorporate Living Learning Communities into upperclassmen housing.</p>\n<p>“The Newman Housing Queer and Trans Cooperative in Isla Vista is currently taking applications, and interested students should apply as soon as they can,” Mernin said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Newman House provides LGBTQ students with the chance to live in an inclusive environment and to meet other people from the community.</p>\n<p>RCGD staff member Johari Hunt also introduced the RCGSD’s new mentorship program. Any interested student can apply to be a mentee, and faculty members are encouraged to volunteer as mentors. Students can find more information on the RCSGD website or Facebook page.</p>\n<p>All students are also welcome to stop by the RCSGD centers or contact Ogui Gonzalez at <em>ogui.gonzalezvila@sa.ucsb.edu</em> for more information about upcoming opportunities.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Mernin’s full name is Hikaru Erza Mernin, not Erza Mernin as previously stated. </em></p>\n<p><i>Correction: Dumlao is the RCSGD diversity education facilitator, not the RCSGD office manager as previously stated. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80644\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80644\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/rcsgd-discusses-future-at-queer-town-hall/","id":2338,"author":{"id":206,"name":"Maya Chandy"},"related":[2337,2336,2335],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/206"}},"__N_SSG":true}
