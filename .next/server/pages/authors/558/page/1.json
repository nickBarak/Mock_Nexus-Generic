In practice, this is an honor I share with the paper you are now reading. I commend what I sincerely hope is a good-faith effort on the part of this paper to provide a healthy dose of transparency to our association. Offering a clear and holistic picture of what is happening with our student government is imperative to the sense of ownership that students should have over A.S. and it should also keep accountable to this basic mission those of us who have been elected, appointed or hired to serve our undergraduates. Transparency and accountability are two values that I not only campaigned upon this past spring, but that I hold very dear to my service in this office.</p>\n<p>To this end, the recent coverage of A.S. has lacked an inside perspective aside from a handful of quotes that could never really paint a complete picture. This in turn, either intentionally or collaterally, has proven to target individuals in the public crosshairs without the benefit of their full story. My hope is simply to provide further clarification of issues that I encourage students to critically analyze and investigate of their own accord.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the front page of the Oct. 5, 2011, issue of the Daily Nexus, the emboldened headline “A.S. Faces Impending Legal Storm” next to an ominous sculpture of the acronym “A.S.” crumbling is more than a tad dramatic and potentially misleading.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The latter is true especially when placed adjacent to the article regarding the personal legal matters of a former Legislative Council representative. Believe what you will about that particular situation, but to think that it in any way brings about a “legal storm” upon our association is entirely untrue, plain and simple. If you are an undergraduate student who has paid your student fees, you are a member of A.S. and can enjoy all of our representation and programming including, but not limited to, A.S. Program Board concerts and representation by the Isla Vista Tenants Union. To say that if you or your fellow undergraduate has run into legal trouble, we as a student body are about to brave the risky seas of any “legal storm” exaggerates the implications of this individual’s personal life. That student will hopefully receive justice in the court of law and out of the court of public opinion. Though while serving as a representative he would absolutely have to face the latter, it has been almost five months since he resigned from office. He is no more a part of A.S. than the authors of these reports.</p>\n<p>The second matter is the three-part saga regarding an internal conflict in the association that involved student and permanent staff members. For everyone’s clarification, staff members (both student and career) are distinguished from students like me because they receive a salary or wage for the work completed, are officially employed by the UC Regents via the University (much like any other University-affiliated position) and are subject and entitled to certain rights and policies in that capacity. There are over 300 students and about 28 permanent staff members working to empower students and provide our numerous student services (including our Recycling Services Program, A.S. Publications, the Ticket Office, Emergency Loan Programs and the A.S. Food Bank just to name a few). The reality is this: We could not function without this remarkably dedicated team. The headline “A.S. Council Clashes With Permanent Staff” — on page three of the Daily Nexus Oct. 7, 2011, edition — inappropriately generalizes the permanent staff team that works pretty thanklessly for students every day. They are far from being paid anything most would consider exorbitant (Don’t believe me? Take a trip to sacbee.com/statepay, cheers to transparency!). Staff members do their jobs because they believe in the genuine power of student service and student representation. While it’s easy for involved students to see this daily, the characterization and large scale first impressions promulgated by this headline, in my opinion, need some context.</p>\n<p>This is not to say there has been no disagreement between student staff and permanent staff. In fact, I’m sure there has been plenty of disagreement between these groups as well as staff and other appointed and/or elected members of Associated Students and certainly within this latter group itself. Conflict is a reality of any working environment. The true distinction of a cohesive and productive organization is the ability to transcend the conflict and move toward resolution.</p>\n<p>This was a process in which we have been fully engaged. We have been working through every available avenue (including, but not limited to, mediation, discussion, etc.) with the presence of all parties involved to see this situation through to a solution for everyone. A newsworthy story might have appropriately surfaced had we exhausted all these channels to an egregious outcome, but we have yet to reach that point.</p>\n<p>My concern is that an exposé that has spanned four articles and seven pages of the last three issues of this publication has cast out the day-to-day benefits, services and work of the vast majority of our students and staff as well as other more newsworthy stories happening on campus and in our community.</p>\n<p>My hope is that this story has sparked within students a desire to demand a level of transparency and accountability consistent with a student government. There’s no better way to do this than becoming involved and taking ownership of our association. You can easily do this by visiting the A.S. Main Office located adjacent to the MultiCultural Center and the UCen (inside the building where you pick up your readers and tickets). As always, please feel free to contact me directly at president@as.ucsb.edu if you would like further clarification on anything I’ve discussed or if you have any questions, comments or concerns with the state of our association.</p>\n<p>Harrison Weber is a fourth-year political science major and the UCSB Associated Students President.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-41713\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/president-urges-student-body-read-headlines/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-41713\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/president-urges-student-body-read-headlines/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/president-urges-student-body-read-headlines/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/president-urges-student-body-read-headlines/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-10/president-urges-student-body-read-headlines/","id":6149,"author":{"id":558,"name":"Harrison Weber"},"related":[6148,6147,6146],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Candidates for Associated Student President Encourage Activism","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Letters to the Editor","publish_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Next year, the UC system will experience $1 billion cuts to a budget that is already a shadow of what it once was.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Next year, the UC system will experience $1 billion cuts to a budget that is already a shadow of what it once was. Just under one year ago, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors voted to pass the Social Host Ordinance, but only a few affected Isla Vista student residents were in attendance. More recently the county decided, with little student consultation, to spend tens of thousands of dollars of its limited resources to prohibit beach access during what would have potentially been Floatopia. Despite some valiant reactive efforts from affected communities, our campus maintains a climate where instances of hate can occur and remain improperly addressed. All the while, crucial student services, such as Student Mental Health Services, are losing funding, often to the point of being cut altogether. These are just a few issues that affect Isla Vista and our collective campus community.\t</p>\n<p>What first must be recognized is none of these issues can be fully and effectively addressed by a single student or group — even a single community. These issues require the cooperative collaboration of stakeholders across the campus, in addition to the support and energy of students who may not be directly affected. While some may consider these students to be apathetic, the Open People’s Party (OPP) believes those who are not involved in fighting the issues affecting our campus have been simply overlooked. Over 85 percent of our students are involved in something other than going to class, twice the national average of universities across the country.\t</p>\n<p>Student apathy can often be explained beyond students not caring about these issues. Either a) students are simply unaware of their ability to make a difference, b) with an increased pressure to take on extra units and find employment to mitigate the rising cost of tuition, students feel they simply do not have time to get involved and take action and/or c) students feel that because the issue does not directly affect their everyday lives, the issue does not warrant their attention.\t</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To overcome these hurdles, OPP candidates will take steps to inform every facet of the student body about these issues and the relevant organizations working toward tangible solutions. OPP’s executive and legislative slate consists of a rich diversity of students, from those heavily involved in Associated Students and other campus groups, to students who have never before had a realistic opportunity to become involved. Our slate has also been chosen based on our candidates’ ability to collaborate, both within and beyond our own ranks. By using our vast personal networks and modes of mass communication (including social networking mediums), we will ensure our campus is well-informed.\t</p>\n<p>But being informed isn’t enough. Many students must be pragmatic when faced with the difficult choice of either: Get a part-time job to make end’s meet, take on extra units to graduate earlier or get involved and take action. We believe there is room for a creative solution. Our candidates will work toward designing a program to award academic units to those whose hard work extends beyond the classroom. This will not require any funds (which our campus doesn’t have and we as students shouldn’t pay) and will serve to mitigate the ever-present issue of crashing classes.\t</p>\n<p>After student knowledge and personal circumstances allow for increased involvement, we as the student government will encourage every facet of the campus to take on the causes that affect students. Those in all communities must work toward our common goals. Our party is called the Open People’s Party because we are open to everyone and welcome as many ideas and perspectives as possible.\tAbove all, involvement starts with your own personal interest to become informed. When these next two weeks bring a storm of campus enthusiasm, please take the time to read about the candidates and participate in our campus democracy.\t</p>\n<p>Harrison Weber is the presidential candidate for Open People’s Party (OPP).</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-36032\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-36032\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-04-12/candidates-student-president-encourage-activism/","id":6192,"author":{"id":558,"name":"Harrison Weber"},"related":[6191,6190,6189],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/558"}},"__N_SSG":true}
