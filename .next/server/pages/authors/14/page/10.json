President Hieu Le said it was “everything [he] expected it to be.”</p>\n<p>“I know it was going to be challenging,” Le said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em>. “But I know what I signed up for and I’m proud. I would do it again if I could.”</p>\n<p>Le, who ran with Campus United during 2017 Spring Quarter elections, was elected over his Isla Vista Party opponent Nawar Nemeh and became UCSB’s first transfer student president.</p>\n<p>“I think having someone who isn’t shy to stray away from conventional norms was a very positive thing in terms of being a transfer,” Le said. “I think having a fresh, innovative perspective [is good] as someone who hasn’t been bogged down by the politics of A.S.”</p>\n<p>He ran on a platform of lowering student fees, “reclaiming” higher education by focusing on college affordability, creating student-owned businesses and “opening up” A.S. to historically marginalized communities.</p>\n<p>Throughout the one-year term of his presidency, he was effective in tackling issues involving sexual assault, addressing college affordability and opening up A.S.; however, he fell short on creating student businesses and working to lower student fees.</p>\n<p>Le addressed his first platform item, tackling college affordability, in part due to his work as a delegate within the California Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>“Being a delegate to the California Democratic Party put me in a unique position to address [college affordability] first hand,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Le said the position allowed him and UCSB Lobby Corps to successfully address college affordability, particularly food insecurity.</p>\n<p>“We had brought forth the concept of food insecurity, which at that time was kind of a new concept, and we had told [Monique Limon] that 48 percent of UCSB students were food insecure,” he said. “Subsequently, after her term began in 2017… she introduced legislation on our behalf.”</p>\n<p>He explained the bill “ended up becoming multiple different things” but eventually <a href=\"http://ahed.assembly.ca.gov/sites/ahed.assembly.ca.gov/files/hearings/AB%20453%20analysis%202017.pdf\">Assembly Bill 453</a>, which was adopted into the state budget, resulted in $3.5 million in state funds that would be used to address food insecurity system wide.</p>\n<p>UCSB received $250,000 of that money, according to Le.</p>\n<p>He explained that the Democratic Party adopted “the most progressive party platform in the country,” which included having tuition-free colleges.</p>\n<p>“I was proud and fortunate to be a co-sponsor for that resolution,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Le said he and Lobby Corps lobbied against the proposed UC Regents tuition hikes, when the regents proposed another tuition increase.</p>\n<p>Since the year 2000, 90,000 students have been enrolled systemwide, but UC still receives the <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/support-uc/ucan/state-budget\">same level of funding</a>, according to the UC website.</p>\n<p>In mid-march, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\">raised out-of-state tuition</a> and postponed the vote on in-state tuition following backlash.</p>\n<p>While not an item on his platform, Le said he is proud of “protecting the health and safety of students” during the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-24/thomas-fire-becomes-largest-wildfire-in-modern-california-history/\">Thomas Fire</a> by asking UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang to delay Fall Quarter final exams.</p>\n<p>When the Thomas Fire first hit the Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties during early December, Yang initially said the Fall Quarter would continue as scheduled.</p>\n<p>However, following several power outages and “hazardous” air quality, Le “pushed back against faculty who did not want to be inconvenienced” and met with Yang to discuss <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\">moving finals.</a></p>\n<p>Le said he sent an email to Yang, asking him to cancel finals and classes, and Yang had responded asking to meet.</p>\n<p>“[He] wanted to hear what my consultation was, in terms of what the student body needs,” Le said. “I told him, as I stated in my letter, that classes needed to be canceled, and finals need to be canceled, and that is what happened… I remained firm in my belief in protecting the health and safety of the students.”</p>\n<p>Winter Quarter began a week later than initially scheduled and Fall Quarter finals took place the week of January 8.</p>\n<p>“Having test anxiety … in addition to horrible conditions, no student should ever go to school when it was that unsafe,” Le said.</p>\n<p>On women’s issues, particularly regarding sexual assault, the A.S. President’s office was involved in the creation of a UC-wide <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/student-advisory-board-formed-for-title-ix-issues/\">Title IX student advisory board</a>, according to Le.</p>\n<p>The board is composed of one undergraduate student and one graduate student from each UC.</p>\n<p>Le said he, UC Title IX coordinator Kathleen Salvaty, UC Los Angeles student body president Arielle Mokhtarzadeh and several staff members from the UC Title IX office worked so students could have an opportunity for “real, substantial change.”</p>\n<p>“[We wanted] to be able to address many of the dangerous things that were happening federally, especially with the Title IX rollbacks from the Obama-era guidelines,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Salvaty <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/first-uc-system-wide-title-ix-coordinator-resigns/\">later resigned</a> in part due to the daily commute of the job and the board is currently working on potential amendments to the UC system-wide policy.</p>\n<p>While Le succeeded in several items on his platform, he failed to lower student fees and worked to raise them during Spring Quarter with the “NewCen” project.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/newcen-to-create-innovation-lab-pedestrian-path/\">project</a>, which involved an innovation lab, renovated food bank and a drastic remodel of the University Center, would have eventually increased student fees by close to $100 a quarter, a number that would rise due to inflation.</p>\n<p>It failed with 81.69 percent of students voting no on the A.S. Elections ballot, but not before the project became a source of controversy across campus.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t say there’s anything I would have done differently with the NewCen, but I would say that I still stand by my decision to push forth that measure,” Le said.</p>\n<p>He said his decision to push for the renovation was “in line with [his] campaign values” because the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/\">UCen</a> is a “dying building.”</p>\n<p>“It’s very shortsighted for students to be paying into a building right now that’s dying,” Le said. “The fact that the value of those dollars that would be spent on revitalizing is worth a lot more than what is currently being paid into a building.”</p>\n<p>To the point of addressing student-owned business, Le said he was unsuccessful with his promise of student-owned businesses, because this would have been addressed in the failed UCen proposal with the innovation lab.</p>\n<p>“We formulated a very comprehensive plan… to be able to give students the opportunity to go innovate, start their own business, and take their own ideas to the marketplace,” Le said. “We attempted, and that is just the way that democracy works.”</p>\n<p>Le’s successor, Campus United candidate Brooke Kopel, won by a narrow margin of 2.04 percent over her opponent Justice Dumlao, who ran with the Isla Vista Party.</p>\n<p>Kopel, a third-year political science and history double major, is currently on the A.S. Senate as a letters and science senator and was the first senate pro-tempore.</p>\n<p>Le praised Kopel’s capabilities and encouraged her to take time to do the things she loves outside of the job.</p>\n<p>“She’s gonna do a great job,” Le said. “One piece of advice I would say is try to enjoy your senior year as well.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the May 17, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The bill is Assembly Bill 453, not Assembly Bill 451, as previously stated.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

documents released to the public during the Community Services District’s (CSD) Tuesday meeting.</p>\n<p>“It’s very likely that there will be a cannabis dispensary in Isla Vista,” said Ethan Bertrand, CSD president.</p>\n<p>Residents of Santa Barbara County will get the chance to vote on Measure T, also known as the Cannabis Operations General Tax, in the June 5 primary election.</p>\n<p>The board voted to endorse the measure with all board members voting in favor except for George Thurlow, who was absent for the meeting.</p>\n<p>If the measure passes, any individual who “engages” in cannabis operations, including the “cultivating, manufacturing, producing, processing, preparing, storing, providing, donating, selling or distributing cannabis” within unincorporated areas of the county would pay a tax on each of the operation’s activities, according to documents released by the county.</p>\n<p>The tax will vary depending on the classification of the business. Nurseries and distributors will pay 1 percent of the total amount an organization receives during its accounting period; manufacturers will pay 3 percent, cultivators will pay 4 percent and retail and micro businesses will pay 6 percent, according to documents released by the county.</p>\n<p>First District Supervisor Das Williams, who chairs the county board, said in a written statement that it is “imperative” that the marijuana is taxed to “ensure compliance and to eradicate the black market.”</p>\n<p>“With legalization comes needed enforcement, education and other services. Santa Barbara County needs to tax cannabis growers and businesses to enforce our ordinance and fund other priorities,” he said in an argument in favor of the measure, which he wrote on behalf of the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p>The board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/land-ordinance-limits-marijuana-sales-in-iv-uc-students-opposed/\">passed an ordinance</a> in early February requiring a buffer zone between marijuana dispensaries and areas with schools or daycare centers, meaning dispensaries cannot be located within 750 feet of these “sensitive areas.”</p>\n<p>Opponents of the measure, including District County Supervisor Peter Adam and Susan Brown, retired sergeant from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, said in a statement that the measure will be “another blank check” for the county.</p>\n<p>“The County faces a $50 million deficit due to misplaced spending priorities,” the group that wrote the opposition statement on the ballot measure. “They want to spend the money how they want it spent, not how we want it spent.”</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, board secretary for the CSD, said he is a big supporter of this measure because it is “necessary” for I.V. to have a dispensary one day.</p>\n<p>“The old I.V. residents would have loved to see this happen,” CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the May 10 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

<em>Courtesy of Roberto Young</em></p></div>\n<p>John de Los Angeles, communications director for the American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 3299, said the union “exhausted” the bargaining process and the public employee relations board, which oversees labor disputes, declared the situation is “at a final impasse.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME’s 9,000 UC Service workers and 15,000 Patient Care Technical workers plan to strike from May 7 to May 9, according to a press release sent out Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>“It just doesn’t appear that we’re going to be reaching an agreement any time soon,” de Los Angeles said. “Strike is a measure of last resort.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME’s first local chapter within the UC system was created at UC Berkeley in 1948. Today, the union represents approximately 24,000 UC workers, according to the union’s website.</p>\n<p>The bargaining team, an elected body chosen to represent the workers, has the sole authority to call for a strike. The union’s bargaining team has met with the UC labor relations team nearly once every month for a year, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>According to a press release from the union, 97 percent of workers within the union voted to “authorize a system-wide strike” in mid-April.</p>\n<p>The release also asked speakers invited to UC graduation events to support union workers by “boycotting university engagements until the labor dispute is solved.”</p>\n<p>AFSCME conducted the voting over two days at locations across the UC’s 10 campuses, five medical centers and research laboratories among others, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>A small group of UC Santa Barbara students held a protest in front of De La Guerra dining commons on April 16 in support of the workers. AFSCME and other union workers within the UC have also previously held several protests on the UCSB campus, <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/court-case-could-bring-financial-strain-to-public-sector-unions/\">most recently</a> on Feb. 15.</p>\n<p>The protests and subsequent vote to strike come following a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/39pjpl3gf26b93t/A3299_PioneeringInequality_WhitePaperNEW_Web_lo-res.pdf?dl=0\">report</a> analyzing demographics of workers across the UC campuses written and released by AFSCME in early April.</p>\n<p>The report stated non-white employees, specifically those in African-American and Latinx communities, are “often hired into lower-paying titles,” while white people are “hired into higher-paying titles.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the report stated male workers were given a higher average hourly starting pay rate than female workers.</p>\n<p>The average hourly starting pay rate for a white male patient care worker was $32.53 while for the same job, an African-American female was giving an average starting hourly pay of $24.97, according to the report.</p>\n<p>The report also stated UC’s African-American workforce has shrunk by 37 percent since 1996.</p>\n<p>“A Black female patient care worker would need to work for 14 years to reach the starting pay of a white man,” the report states. “A Latina patient care worker would reach the starting wage of a white man after working for 13 years, and a Latina service worker would catch up to a white man’s starting wage after four years.”</p>\n<p>The report took data from UC employment records, according to de Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“They’re all coming in [for] starting positions, and women of color are just being paid less,” he said.</p>\n<p>The UC has not yet released a public statement in response to the vote or the report, but de Los Angeles said the UC placed conditions in its union contracts “which is why our workers are so upset today.”</p>\n<p>Those conditions include raising the retirement age, raising healthcare rates and holding wages constant.</p>\n<p>“We strongly disagreed with AFSCME’s decision to strike, which will negatively impact patients, students and the UC community,” said Claire Doan, UCOP director of media relations, in an email. “What the union demanded was a 6 percent annual wage increase, which we think is unfair to other UC employees – both represented and non-represented. This is twice what other UC employees have received.”</p>\n<p>Doan said that UCOP has decided to increase AFSCME employees’ wages by two percent for the upcoming fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“UC presented AFSCME leaders with what we believe to be a competitive final settlement proposal that included multi-year wage increases (3 percent annual for four years) along with excellent health and retirement benefits,” she said. “They chose to reject it without conducting vote among their members.”</p>\n<p>The workers’ healthcare premiums will be “brought in line” with the rest of UC’s represented and non-represented employees and the retirement benefits of current employees will remain unchanged while new workers will be offered a choice between a tradition pension or a 401(k)-style plan, according to Doan.</p>\n<p>The raises were stalled for more than a year due to “protracted negotiations,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the April 26 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><i>Update: This article was updated to include information about the union’s upcoming strike. </i></p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a statement from the UC labor relations team. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Queer Commission, board member of the Student Affairs Student Council, director for Coalition for a Better UC and diversity education coordinator for the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel is currently a Letters and Science Senator on the A.S. Senate, was First Senate President Pro-Tempore, a social conduct caseworker for the Office of the Student Advocate and is a coach on UC Santa Barbara’s mock trial team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During opening statements, both Kopel and Dumalo spoke about wanting to unite the campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Throughout my time here, I’ve seen a lot of good, but I’ve also seen a lot of division,” Kopel said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao echoed that statement, explaining that there is an “A.S. bubble” on campus and said he wants to make sure that “all of our voices are heard.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Topics discussed at the forum can be seen below:</span></p>\n<p><b>NUMBER ONE PROBLEM:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said one of the biggest problems facing students on campus are financial problems and identified the $66 fix, an item on the Democratic party platform focused on free higher education, as a way to help with this issue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel agreed with Dumlao. She referenced her position within UCSB’s Lobby Corps and said students need to put pressure on the state legislature to fund the UC.</span></p>\n<p><b>ADVOCACY:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel spoke of her time on the senate, stating Senate has passed several resolutions in support of various communities on campus, specifically the LGBTQ+ and Jewish communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Obviously I am not a part of all of the communities on campus and I can’t empathize with every single community, but as a woman, as a member of the LGBTQ community and also as a Jewish student, I can definitely sympathize with members of marginalized communities and I will always work to be their resource,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said as president, he would make sure that every community is heard at every level, specifically within A.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he has been doing work with marginalized communities “pretty much my whole time at UCSB through protests, plannings, meetings, pretty much everything under the sun.”</span></p>\n<p><b>PRIORITIES:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said his priority as president would be making sure that A.S. listens to the general student body because “A.S. shouldn’t be deciding on what we focus on based on ourselves, we should be talking about the needs of the community members and making sure that they understand that we are here for them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said A.S. needs to prioritize completing projects that may be lost from year to year and creating a continuing projects coordinator position within A.S.</span></p>\n<p><b>EXPERIENCE:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumlao said he has been involved with “every space on campus” and referenced his time with the RCSGD and Queer Commission among others.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel again spoke of her time on senate and about her experiences with marginalized communities on campus. She said her time on campus has allowed her to develop relationships within A.S., the administration and the Office of Student Life that would allow her to succeed as president.</span></p>\n<p><b>NEWCEN:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel said her personal opinion on the University Center project does not matter to students and encouraged students to vote based on their own opinions.

They are the only candidates on this year’s ballot who are running independently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both currently work within A.S. Ettleson is currently the chief of staff within the OSA, while Martinez is a letters and science senator within the A.S. Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the issues addressed during Monday’s S.A.G. debate:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>TRANSPARENCY</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said she would be as transparent as she can be with case work due to the confidential nature of the information within the office, but will be “as transparent as possible with [her] own work” and what students’ needs are.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez was not present to answer the first question as she arrived late.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>ROLE</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez described the S.A.G. as someone who is “willing to speak out for communities who have historically been silenced on campus” and is focused on making A.S. more accessible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said the role of S.A.G. is complex and focuses on helping students with issues such as housing policy and violations of student code of conduct, as well as helping students navigate issues with the administration. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>EXPERIENCE</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson explained her role as the OSA’s chief of staff, working “with the operations of the office, advocating for students’ needs in the association and throughout the community [and] working with the current Student Advocate General.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said that, as a senator, she has served on the housing committee, created the first international student BCU, the first public and mental health commission and was the only senator to serve on the housing and textbook affordability committee.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>PRESSING ISSUES STUDENTS FACE</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Martinez, the biggest issue students face is making higher education more accessible due to the problems under the current Trump administration, specifically for students who come from marginalized and disadvantaged communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said the most pressing problem students have faced this past year is “how many issues are being [dealt with],” including food insecurity, housing problems, increasing tuition and various legal issues. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>PARTISANSHIP</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about partisanship within the UCSB community, Ettleson said this position requires “putting the job first and yourself second” in order to remove personal interests from the matters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez referenced Ettleson’s point, emphasizing that the job is number one and that regardless of political affiliations, the “ability to make a difference in somebody’s life and the ability to change and make or break somebody’s career” comes above all.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>IMPROVING S.A.G.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ettleson said she wants to make sure the office is operating at maximum effectiveness with “increased sufficiency.” She explained that she would like office hours to be held in other spaces on campus to increase accessibility and implement programs that would reduce the number of housing and student code of conduct violations, specifically aiming to make OSA a household name. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said she would like to expand on the current S.A.G.’s polling project by implementing community organizers who would then specifically work to target first-year students. “[I want to] tailor our resources, our programs and our outreach to make sure that the services the office offers [are beneficial],” she said.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>INVOLVEMENT IN A.S. IF NOT ELECTED</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If not elected, Ettleson said she would “try and be involved in Associated Students in any way that would help me continue some of the work that needs to be done” and help bridge the gap between Associated Students and the rest of the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez said she would focus her energy on making sure that the BCUs she created are up and running and would continue to make sure that her work as a senator would “continue regardless of the position that [she holds.]”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 52 A.S. candidates will be up shortly.</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Martinez said she was the only senator to serve on the housing and textbook affordability committee, not the textbook affordability community. She created the first public and mental health committee, not the first mental health committee, as previously stated. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The UCen renovation project will include an innovation lab, a demonstration kitchen, a Wellness Center and an A.S. Bike shop. The total cost of the project and sources of funding are still undetermined. Irene Chen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>“I think this project is transformational in its scope,” said Mark Nocciolo, director of capital development at UC Santa Barbara. Nocciolo has overseen early renovation plans and worked with the architect and Associated Students (A.S.) to help visualize the project.</p>\n<p>“The intent is to try to redefine the University Center to be less like a mall and more like a student union. Anybody who has been to any Division 1 campus would recognize that there’s usually a university center that’s more student-oriented than ours is,” he explained.</p>\n<p>The model was developed by Nocciolo and Jean Gaff, managing principal of Pfeiffer Architects.</p>\n<p>The plans radically change and “revitalize” the University Center (UCen) into a “NewCen,” according to A.S. President Hieu Le.</p>\n<p>“Today’s Student Affairs’ (S.A.) service needs substantially exceed the capacity of S.A. facilities, compromising functionality, collaborations and staff and student well-being,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The renovated UCen would include a new “innovation lab” where students could collaborate on projects, a “demonstration kitchen” in which chefs would offer cooking lessons and connectivity kiosks, in which students tabling for their organizations would have a space to set up shop.</p>\n<p>These features are in addition to elements previously described on the project’s ballot measure, such as expanded space for the A.S. Food Bank, Campus Learning and Assistive Services (CLAS) and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.).</p>\n<p>The 3D model additionally projects an expanded Wellness Center, which currently exists inside Student Health. As <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/stagnant-2-million-fund-could-offset-ucen-project-costs-fees-will-still-rise-after-inflation/\">previously reported</a>, the building would also include a migrated A.S. Bike Shop.</p>\n<p>The project would also include a new “pedestrian zone” adjacent to the building, which would allow more space for people walking through on campus tours.</p>\n<p>Several areas of the current UCen, such as the bookstore, Starbucks and some of the food areas, will remain in business throughout construction, Le said.</p>\n<p>Since the project was first proposed, students have disputed how much it would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">actually cost</a>, while information about the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/\">state of the current UCen</a> and Le’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/petition/\">petitioning methods</a> have been controversial topics across the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>If students vote to pass the project, student fees will be increased $20.40 per quarter from Fall 2018 until Fall 2022. From Fall 2022 to Fall 2052, students will pay an additional $96.06 per quarter.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of alumni donations, student fees and the university itself, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“At this current state we don’t know [exactly how much people will pay] because there are a lot of factors, such as donations,” he said.</p>\n<p>This is the third time an A.S. president has created a UCen renovation plan. During the 2013-14 school year, then-President Jonathan Abboud developed a similar plan that would have expanded space in the UCen to allocate more space to campus services. The plan failed on the spring ballot.</p>\n<p>Another failed UCen renovation, proposed in 2011, would have expanded third-floor study space. In 2012, then-President Harrison Weber created a plan for an entirely new building, a Student Engagement Center. Students voted down the fee initiative in the spring election.</p>\n<p>While the organization of different spaces has varied in the different UCen plans, the concept has remained fairly consistent, Nocciolo said.</p>\n<p>He noted that the latest renovation project differs from the previous ones because it addresses infrastructural problems that are reportedly plaguing the facility.</p>\n<p>Students will vote on this project in April 23-26.

the UCen will cost approximately $5.5 million dollars, according to documents from UC Santa Barbara Housing, Dining and Auxiliary Enterprises from Jan. 12 this year.</p>\n<p>“The UCen is very outdated. There’s a lot of aspects of just the infrastructure alone that haven’t been updated since the building opened in 1966,” McCrary said.</p>\n<p>All of the original sewer cast iron lines need to be replaced, specifically in the central kitchen and bathrooms, according to the documents.

He explained that there is currently no way to get rid of the smell.</p>\n<p>On Thursday morning, McCrary noticed a UCen closet that was filled with water from a broken sewer line.</p>\n<p>“If the UCen is rotting from the inside out, it doesn’t make sense to spend money upstairs if everything on the inside is still bursting. It’s more of a safety hazard more than anything as well, but also there’s a lot of leaks in the UCen because of the joints,” he added.</p>\n<p>Skylights above the Hub and the Information Desk have “several known leaks” that need to be repaired with new waterproofing, according to documents.</p>\n<p>Approximately 54,300 square feet of the existing roof needs to be replaced as well because it is over 25 years old and has “several known leaks.” There is also additional “water intrusion at expansion joints” at Corwin Pavilion and SB Printer.</p>\n<p>Part of the roof collapsed on March 21 in the area near the Subway in the UCen, according to Associated Students President Hieu Le. He explained that a student initially contacted him about the issue.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_82240\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"420696172\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"82231\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82240\" data-attachment-id=\"82240\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/broken-outdated-pipes-to-blame-for-ucen-smell/ucen-ceiling-collapse/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1536,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Ucen ceiling collapse\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-82240\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=188%2C250&amp;ssl=1 188w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=1122%2C1496&amp;ssl=1 1122w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=840%2C1120&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=687%2C916&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ucen-ceiling-collapse.jpg?w=1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-82240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The collapsed piece of the ceiling can be seen in the photo above. <em>Courtesy of Hieu Le</em></p></div>\n<p>“It hasn’t been updated in over 50 years; we’re using a design and technology that do not meet modern efficiency standards,” Le said.</p>\n<p>There is currently no heat or air conditioning in the UCen Lobby or the Hub and the emergency generator circuit capacity needs to be expanded to include all “life safety and operational equipment,” according to the documents.</p>\n<p>Approximately $22,500 of this budget would be used to replace toilet partitions, hand dryers and other various bathroom accessories in three of the UCen bathrooms that have not been updated since 1966. These bathrooms need new water supply lines and need to be re-tiled.</p>\n<p>New “low-flow” toilets, faucets and fixtures need to be placed in the bathrooms as well, according to the documents.</p>\n<p>A total of 21 exterior doors need to be replaced and fitted with new locks. The UCen also needs to replace four of its regular elevators and one freight elevator.</p>\n<p>The sprinkler system is functional, but needs to be replaced and it is recommended that exposed sprinkler heads be concealed to prevent vandalism, according to the documents. Some of the UCen’s fire alarm control panels need to be upgraded to a campus standard networked system.</p>\n<p>“Those are the most essentially priority needs. We’ve accounted for that in the total priority costs,” Le said.</p>\n<p>Money raised by the UCen renovation project would be used to address these repairs, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“If this renovation expansion were to not happen, that operation and maintenance fee over a span of 30 years is going to accumulate to $40 to $45 million that’s spent into a current facility right now that is deteriorating and has declining value,” he said.</p>\n<p>Currently, students are paying approximately $40 a quarter in student fees to the UCen. If students <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-18/ucen-project-will-be-on-a-s-elections-ballot/\">vote</a> to pass the UCen renovation project at the end of April, student fees will increase by $20.40 until 2022, and to $96.06 until 2052.</p>\n<p>These numbers will rise due to inflation, according to documents obtained by the <em>Nexus</em>.</p>\n<p>Design fees, internal feels, insurance, escalation and contingency fees are not included in the budget estimate.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the April 5 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include a Thursday morning picture of a sewer leak in a water closet. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
