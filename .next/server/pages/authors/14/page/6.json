The university feels the way to a deal is at the bargaining table – not on the picket lines – and should not come at the expense of patients, students, the university, and our communities,” UCOP Director of Media Relations Claire Doan said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“AFSCME leaders distributed a press release announcing their intent to strike </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at the same time</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their negotiators were with UC at the table.

Since 2015, the UC system overall has accepted an additional 14,500 California undergraduates and aims to increase this in the coming years, as stated in the press release.</p>\n<p>“Part of UC’s mission is to do everything possible to help students reach their college dreams,” UC Regents Vice Chair John A. Perez added in the press release.</p>\n<p>“We continue to do so in a number of ways, including addressing the total cost of attendance, such as food and housing needs, and working to develop a multiyear strategic plan that not only supports students’ financial needs but also expands access to UC for more Californians.”</p>\n<p>Rising college costs, coupled with a growing movement calling for tuition-free colleges, have made tuition hikes increasingly controversial as the Regents discuss it each year. Students groups typically attend Regents meetings to argue against the hikes.</p>\n<p>Last year, the UC Regents voted to <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-07-19/uc-regents-vote-to-decrease-tuition-by-60/\">lower</a> in-state tuition by $60 – a result from eliminating legal fees – and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-16/uc-regents-raise-out-of-state-tuition-cite-low-funding-in-state-budget-plan/\">raised</a> out-of-state tuition tuition by 3.5 percent.</p>\n<p>As of Fall Quarter 2018, out-of-state students compose approximately 21 percent, or over 58,500 students, of the UC system. In 2017, the Regents <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-05-21/regents-approve-nonresident-enrollment-cap/\">voted</a> to limit the number of out-of-state students allowed at each UC to 18 percent.</p>\n<p>The non resident numbers include both students from other states within the U.S. as well as international students.</p>\n<p>As of the 2018-2019 school year, <a href=\"https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/cost-of-attendance\">the cost of attending UCSB</a> as an in-state undergraduate who lives in an on-campus residence hall amounts to approximately $36,798; for an in-state undergraduate who lives off campus, this number drops to $33,768.</p>\n<p>Those numbers increase for nonresident students.</p>\n<p>However, according to the press release, about 57 percent of current California undergraduates pay no tuition, and an additional 20 percent have part of the costs covered by financial aid programs.</p>\n<p>The Regents will vote on whether or not to raise out-of-state tuition for the 2019-2020 during its upcoming meeting this week. Napolitano is recommending that the Regents increase nonresident tuition by 2.6 percent, from $28,992 to $29,754, the Los Angeles Times <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-edu-uc-no-tuition-increase-20190307-story.html\">reported. </a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

The subsequent water damage due to the roof failure was extensive, requiring the relocation of over 16 staff as well as the front desk operation for HDAE,” Miller said in an email.</p>\n<p>She noted that the storm brought several inches of water into about 85 percent to 95 percent of the main office, along with water damage to the furniture and fallen ceiling tiles.</p>\n<p>Since the storm, university staff has been working with contractors to remove damaged building parts – including air handling units and electric systems – while also “shoring up the damaged roof structure for safety and to mitigate further water damage during winter rain events,” Miller added.</p>\n<p>The service will remain in the space from anywhere between two and four months, depending on the extent of the damage done to the office, according to UCen Director Gary Lawrence.</p>\n<p>“The University Center, in consultation with HDAE management, agreed to help out with a temporary relocation of some HDAE staff whose offices were seriously damaged in one of the recent storms,” Lawrence said in an email.</p>\n<p>HDAE will be paying the “standard rate” charged by the UCen, according to Miller.

Former Campus United party chair Katie Mukai then filed a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/former-cu-co-chair-files-judicial-council-petition-about-on-campus-senator-salari-living-off-campus/\">petition</a> against Salari on Jan. 29, arguing that Salari should be removed from her position.</p>\n<p>The council <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/judicial-council-hears-salari-trial/\">heard arguments</a> in <em>Katie Mukai</em> v. <em>Yasamin Salari</em> on Feb. 20, with Mukai named as the petitioner and Salari as the respondent.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Judicial-Council-Opinion-On-Mukai-v.-Salari.pdf\">opinion</a> rules in favor of Mukai.</p>\n<p>“The Respondent’s place of residence constitutes a breach of the Associated Students Legal Code,” the council wrote in a statement released Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>“The Judicial Council determines that the Respondent is not eligible for the position of On­-Campus Senator and finds that the Respondent cannot continue in office as On­-Campus Senator in the 69th Senate.”</p>\n<p>As stated in Associated Students (A.S.) By-­Laws Article III §1(B)(4), seen on page 21 of the most recent version of the legal code, all Senators are required to live amongst their constituents during the fall, winter and spring quarters of their terms.</p>\n<p>Salari’s representation during her trial – former Off-Campus Senator for the 68th Senate Alexandra Gessesse – argued that Salari’s living arrangement did not inhibit her ability to represent her on-campus constituents.</p>\n<p>However, the council found that Salari’s “quality of work as a Senator did not pertain to the question of eligibility.”</p>\n<p>Following Salari’s initial admission, the A.S. Senate granted her a one-time exception. During the trial, Gessesse pointed to incidents in the past when Senates granted one-time exceptions to senators who lived out of their respective constituencies.</p>\n<p>However, the council invalidated Senate’s ability to do so in Tuesday’s opinion, stating that while Senate has the power to make changes to legal code, they “are not allowed to circumvent the breach of legal code through special exceptions.”</p>\n<p>“The Legal Code of the Associated Students is the foremost authority on Associated Students rules and regulations and cannot be superseded by Senate motions and resolutions,” the council wrote in the statement.</p>\n<p>“The Students of UCSB are entitled to representation by individuals living among them. Allowing a one-­time exception to the eligibility requirements for these representative positions undermines this principle and is harmful towards the constituents’ needs.”</p>\n<p>Salari will be allowed to keep her Fall Quarter 2018 honoraria, and can apply for her Winter Quarter 2019 honoraria.</p>\n<p>The next runner up to take her place is second-year history of public policy major Eric Moon, according to Spring Quarter 2018 Election results.</p>\n<p>It is unknown at this time if or when Salari’s seat will be filled.

CSD) Director Natalie Jordan. Jordan, who officially left in January 2019, previously told the <em>Nexus</em> that she felt it was time for “someone else to step into that position.”</p>\n<p>Jordan had served her original two-year term, but the terms of office had changed for her seat due to technicalities in election code.</p>\n<p>The individual who will fill Jordan’s empty seat will hold the position until December 2020.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD will interview all of the candidates and vote on who to select during Tuesday night’s meeting, which will begin at 4:30 p.m. The board previously extended the deadline to apply before the application period closed on Feb. 19.</p>\n<p>Previously, four candidates had applied; however, Goleta-based psychologist Jeremy Roark withdrew from the race on Monday, citing the “importance of student representation” for the board.</p>\n<p>The agenda for Tuesday’s meeting can be viewed <a href=\"https://islavistacsd.ca.gov/files/764548f33/2_26_19+Regular+Meeting+Agenda.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Overviews of the candidates’ qualifications and experience can be viewed below:</p>\n<p><strong>Fourth-year economics and statistical science double major Jeremy Levine:</strong></p>\n<p>Levine described Isla Vista as “a little slice of paradise.”</p>\n<p>“It’s in a lot of ways a melting pot of different people and personalities getting to just pursue learning and living and having a good time,” Levine told the <em>Nexus</em>. “So why the CSD? I would like to represent these people, and I would like to make this place which I view as a little slice of paradise even closer to the ideal of what it could be.”</p>\n<p>Levine cited his financial experience both as an editor for The Bottom Line and as an intern for the Economic Forecast Project when asked what he believed he could bring to the board.</p>\n<p>“I think what makes me unique is my approach to solving issues here. It is a very solutions-driven approach. It is a process-driven approach,” he said.</p>\n<p>If chosen for the board, Levine would focus on gathering information from the community about their needs and then would want to use that data to plan the board’s priorities for the year.</p>\n<p>Levine also said he has a special interest in prioritizing environmental awareness and environmental justice in I.V., emphasizing his background as co-chair of the Environmental Awareness Board and his environmentally-friendly work in I.V. since he first arrived at UCSB.</p>\n<p>When asked about the board’s diversity, Levine admitted that he doesn’t quite “bring any diversity to the table,” noting that the board is currently all male and primarily white, and that the two other candidates might have more to offer in terms of their lived experiences.</p>\n<p>However, Levine believes that he could bridge that gap by prioritizing accessibility and outreach as a member of the board, and he hopes to ensure that the board elected by the end of his term in December 2020 will “look dramatically different from the current board” in diversity, socioeconomic background and role in I.V.</p>\n<p>Although Levine will graduate from UCSB in Spring 2019 with a double major in economics and statistical science, he plans to remain in I.V. to work at the California Center for Public Policy in Santa Barbara and, if elected, for the I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p><strong>Second-year pre-sociology major Kristie Nguyen:</strong></p>\n<p>In her resume, Nguyen describes herself as an “Isla Vista resident with a passion for politics and the community.”</p>\n<p>“Isla Vista has become my home away from home, a community that I have grown a deep connection with,” she said in her cover letter, speaking of how she wants to represent both the students and the permanent I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“My goal is to make sure that every student and resident that is asked about their residency in Isla Vista is smiling because of their genuine care and love for it.”</p>\n<p>She has experience working in public relations for two UCSB organizations: Campus Democrats and Alpha Delta Pi sorority. She is currently Campus Democrats’ publicity director and is on the public relations committee in the Alpha Delta Pi sorority.</p>\n<p>She has also worked as an intern for Santa Barbara Mayor Cathy Murillo, for Congressman Salud Carbajal and for Assembly Member Monique Limon.</p>\n<p>Nguyen has prior involvement with the I.V. CSD’s <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/\">Measure R campaign</a>, where she worked as the publicity coordinator.</p>\n<p>In her cover letter, she pointed out that she would be the “the first and only woman of color on the board” – referring to the board’s currently all-male and majority white status – and that she would “offer diverse and beneficial input on the development of community, student representation, and women’s rights.”</p>\n<p>Her specific goals include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increasing the number of CSOs on the 67 and 68 blocks of I.V., and have them “actively patrolling” areas that contain “active parties,” such as Del Playa Drive and fraternity neighborhoods;</li>\n<li>encouraging CSOs to be “more proactive” by asking residents if they need help rather than waiting for calls;<br>\ninstalling additional lighting in I.V., particularly on the further blocks;</li>\n<li>limiting I.V. parking to I.V. residents;</li>\n<li>promoting housing affordability;</li>\n<li>improving the I.V. CSD’s reputation by promoting the district’s social media platforms;</li>\n<li>and “ensuring that women are a prioritized topic of discussion and that the local government stands with victims.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Installing additional lighting is already a project <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/evpla-publishes-proposal-for-lighting-expansion-in-isla-vista/\">being tackled</a> by the I.V. CSD in partnership with UCSB’s External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) office and the Associated Students Lobby Corps.</p>\n<p>Nguyen did not specify in her cover letter how she would limit parking to I.V. residents or promote housing affordability, nor where the funding would come from for additional CSOs.</p>\n<p>She plans to graduate from UCSB with the class of 2021 with a sociology major and a minor in Asian American studies.</p>\n<p>Nguyen did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-year sociology and Chinese double major Lindsay Sherman:</strong></p>\n<p>In her cover letter, Sherman cited her communication skills as a reason she would be fit for the board.</p>\n<p>“I am passionate about serving my community and enhancing the quality of life for its members when and where I can,” Sherman says in her cover letter. “I believe my experience, knowledge, and interpersonal abilities would make me a perfect fit for this position.”</p>\n<p>Sherman did not outline a specific list of goals that she would tackle if elected.</p>\n<p>She currently works as a teaching assistant at the UCSB Orfalea Family Children’s Center, stating in her cover letter that she “work[s] with several teachers, administrators, and coworkers every day in order to enrich the lives and experiences of the attending children and their families as much as possible.”</p>\n<p>Sherman has also volunteered as a middle school international teacher for the Green Lion Bali Foundation in Bali, Indonesia, as well as two educational programs in Santa Barbara: the SciTrek Elementary School Teaching Program and the Volunteer Elementary School Teaching Assistant. Additionally, she was a certified volunteer at the American Red Cross from 2012 to 2016.</p>\n<p>She speaks three languages – English, conversational Mandarin and elementary-level Spanish – as stated in her resume.</p>\n<p>She plans to graduate from UCSB with the class of 2020, with a sociology major and a minor in education.</p>\n<p>Sherman did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [11:34 a.m.] </em></p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence and Sanya Kamidi can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

according to Claire Doan, UC director of Media Relations.</p>\n<p>The university will send a notification letter and a check to the affected employees within 60 business days.</p>\n<p>Students who are represented by the <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Union of Academic Student Employees (UAW 2865), and who do not receive payment, should contact the union; unrepresented students who do not receive payment should reach out to their campus payroll representative, Doan said in an email. </span></p>\n<p>“Student leaders told us that students whose pay was disrupted were being subjected to late fees and other fines ranging from $10 to $150. We decided to apply the high end of that range to everyone affected and accounted for taxes, so impacted employees will receive a net of $150,” Doan said.</p>\n<p>“We believe it is important to address the financial hardships of the small number of students who experienced payroll problems and reached out to the union with a proposal to provide these payments. After months of negotiations with UAW, we believe we have reached a fair agreement to help impacted students.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPath, UC’s new payment system, has </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/ucpath-program-creates-problems-for-ucsb-employees/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">caused disruptions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the UC system since its implementation in Fall Quarter 2018.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fall 2018 implementation of UCPath… resulted in paycheck inaccuracies for hundreds of academic student employees on several UC campuses,” the joint press release said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“UC greatly appreciates UAW’s partnership in identifying and working through these issues.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s chapter of the UAW 2865 </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/uaw-meets-with-administration-in-impromptu-meeting-demands-ucsb-solve-back-pay-issues-by-feb-1/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previously met</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the UCSB administration on Jan. 31 to discuss UCPath issues, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reported. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB’s Graduate Student Union has also been lobbying the administration to fix issues with UCPath since its implementation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The system will be implemented at two other campuses, UC Berkeley and UC Davis, within the coming weeks.

It passed unanimously during the meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>“There is a lack of concept continuity among incoming AS Presidents which can perpetuate a culture of unfinished projects that may waste AS resources,” the bill states, arguing that Associated Students (A.S.) Presidents can be “limited” in their abilities to finish projects due to their one-year terms.</p>\n<p>The creation of the position was one of Kopel’s main projects that she hoped to accomplish during her term as A.S. President.</p>\n<p>“Particularly with this office, and especially my projects, [these] are definitely more long-term projects,” Kopel said in an interview with the <i>Nexus </i>earlier last week.</p>\n<p>“Having that position is really crucial in making sure that there’s no transition divide that would inhibit the projects from being carried through.”</p>\n<p>The position must be filled by someone who will be at UC Santa Barbara for the entirety of the 2019-2020 school year and is also familiar with the type of projects that the Office of the President takes on.</p>\n<p>The filling of the position is up to Kopel’s discretion, without prior approval from the Senate, the resolution states.</p>\n<p>The position’s duties entail staying up to date on all of the president’s short-term and long term projects, meeting with the president once a week, meeting with A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez once a quarter, attending at least two Senate meetings per quarter, being in attendance and taking notes at all project-related meetings with the president, holding two office hours per week and serving at least four quarters over a span of two academic years.</p>\n<p>Kopel said that ideally she would transition one of her fellows into fulfilling that position.</p>\n<p>“Since all of my fellows are first-years, they will definitely be here next year and next Fall Quarter to transition or help the new president in any way that they can.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> held at the beginning of her term, Kopel said that being in A.S. for so long – first as a caseworker with the Office of the Student Advocate and then as a Letters and Science Senator for the 68th Senate – prompted her to create the position.</p>\n<p>“There’s so many fantastic ideas that students in these leadership positions [come up with] but cannot accomplish in a year,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>“That’s shameful that you have something that would be so beneficial for this community, the campus community, and it’s literally just not accomplished because there’s bureaucratic issues.”</p>\n<p>She admitted that the position may not fix the projects problem entirely, but believes that “attempting it would be a great start.”</p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object><br>\n<a class=\"pdflink\" style=\"display: none;\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A-resolution-to-update-the-legal-code-of-the-AS-Office-of-the-President.pdf\">Download Document</a></p>\n<p><em>Updated [2:20 p.m.]</em></p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence is the county news editor at the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com or evelyn@dailynexus.com. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 14, 2019 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

In order to actually hold an executive office, the candidate must also fulfill the same requirements.</li>\n<li>An executive office must be declared vacant during a Senate meeting if there is the removal, disqualification or resignation of an officer. The “disqualification” portion is an addition to the previous version of legal code.</li>\n<li>Candidates can now use a preferred name when running. They have the option to either use their legal name or the name as it appears on student records for the ballot.</li>\n<li>Candidates are no longer required to attend the mixer/event/retreat that is typically held following the declaration of candidacy meeting.</li>\n<li>Any candidates involved in violations that “may have led” to party disqualification will be disqualified, while the remaining candidates will run as independents.
