An officer on the scene confirmed that the suspect was male and that the black car found on Camino Pescadero was the driver’s car. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was visible damage to the front, back and sides of the car.

She earned a masters in feminist studies at UCSB in 2015 and has since served as a teaching assistant for several courses within the department. </span></p>\n<p>According to Tanner’s <a href=\"http://www.lauratanner.net/about/\">website</a>, her doctoral research is focused around “the mistaken idea that biological sex is socially constructed or possible to change” and “the abusive and dangerously experimental practices of medically “transing” children and young adults.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada said that the university could not discuss specific incidents because of confidentiality requirements but said that UCSB will review any reports of campus policy violations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada declined to comment on any potential complaints against Tanner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a list of some tweets visible on Tanner’s account, posted between January and June: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June 20: “People who think they are transgender exist. No debate. There is no such thing as actually being transgender (a male woman or a female man). Believing so is a delusion. I will not validate such a decision by validating terms like ‘trans people’ Interpret that as you will.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 5: “Yea, like ‘woman’ ‘female,’ ‘man’ &amp; ‘male?’ These words all have original definitions based on reality. Transsexualism started this mess by trying to change ‘man/woman’ to include people of the opposite sex &amp; fantaszing that drugs &amp; cutting change one’s sex in the first place.”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 29: “Rather than resolving dysphoria or dysmorphia, ‘transition’ maintains &amp; reinforces a state of opposition to one’s own body and forces one to live in a constant state of cognitive dissonance. This is not mental health care. #StopTransingKids #TruthisNotAHateCrime” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calling males women, or females men is the very definition of misgendering </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I feel deeply disrespected by the notion that any male can call themselves a woman and be considered the same gender as me. #MalePrivilge #TransWomenAreMen #TruthIsNotAHateCrime”  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 28: “If you ever had a dick you aren’t a lesbian, not now, not ever.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 26: “Genital cutting of any kind does not change one’s sex and can never make a man into a woman.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 14: “Trans ‘women’ are men, ffs”;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">March 2: “Stand up for your son because he is perfect the way he was born – a boy. No child is trans. It’s not possible to be born in the wrong body.” </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feb. 4: “People who believe themselves to be trans exist.

to her tweets, students have called Tanner “absolute trash,” a “dumb bitch” and “a gatekeeper of womanhood.” One student tweeted “that bitch needs to die.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other responses on Twitter called for Tanner to lose her job, arguing that Tanner’s beliefs interfered with her ability to teach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter from the nearly 400 UCSB alumni echoed some of the rhetoric seen on Twitter, demanding that the university take steps to protect transgender and genderqueer students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Instructors should not promote material in the classroom and department that denies the reality of trans people’s experiences or reifies gendered and sexed binaries as essential or real,” the authors emphasized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These issues are not merely an academic debate; when the academy legitimates transphobia, it lends credence to an ideological position that systematically disenfranchises and kills trans people.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The open letter from the graduate students also spoke out in support of “trans, non-binary and sex working students at UC Santa Barbara,” stating that “in our classrooms, curricula, and professional interactions, we are committed to supporting trans and sex working students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As part of Feminist Studies, we are committed to cultivating intersectional, student-centered learning and community environments. To the students who have been harmed by transphobia and anti-sex worker rhetoric in our department, we are so sorry.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While neither letter mentions Tanner directly, both letters were released shortly after Tanner faced backlash on social media. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two second-year UCSB students, Kyremina Youssef and Ari Moini, saw Tanner’s posts on Twitter and decided to organize the June 13 demonstration to make the greater student body aware of Tanner’s social media posts. The demonstration echoed the themes of the two open letters: that those who hold transphobic beliefs should not be allowed to teach at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moini said she believes it is “unsafe for the trans community on campus” for Tanner to teach at the school, and Youssef added that the two would hold additional rallies if Tanner continued teaching in the fall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youssef said that while she knows Tanner is “protected by her First Amendment on Twitter,” the students are “also showing our First Amendment [rights] on campus by advocating for our community here and spreading awareness.”</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanya Kamidi and Max Abrams contributed reporting. </span></i></p>\n<p><em>Updated [11:34 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

I’m not looking really for people who have experience in A.S., because I didn’t even have any coming in,” he said. “One of my interview questions is, ‘What is your perception of A.S., and how would you like to alter that?’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley’s priorities going forward are ensuring that summer conferences are organized in a timely manner, which especially helps with saving costs, he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the conferences are over, he plans to start laying the groundwork for his office’s work in the fall so they can hit the ground running. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The thing I’m really, really wanting to focus on is supporting incarcerated people now and people who were formerly incarcerated, so I’ll be working really hard with my federal policy analyst and statewide policy analyst to see just what is the UC’s role in private prisons,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley wants to ensure that his office has its timeline sketched out early on in the year so it can get as much done as possible, noting that a yearlong term isn’t very long at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his outreach both to students and student organizations already on campus, as well as to incoming first years, Beasley plans to prioritize in-person presentations.

The markets would be community spaces where residents could sell and showcase their art, beauty products and other handmade items. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Ornelas, the current climate for local markets consists of “a bunch of folks who are really passionate about [art] and kind of just make a Facebook group and have to shell out their own money to sell it at these [markets].”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I really want to create the infrastructure for a space where folks can go showcase and sell their art,” Ornelas told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “My vision for that is kind of like a bimonthly or monthly farmer’s market type of thing funded by A.S.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from his desire to create a new local market, Ornelas’ work as an off-campus senator led him to spearhead the development of a </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/a-s-senate-creates-committee-to-address-mold-in-i-v-residences/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mold committee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January, which surveyed I.V. residents to gain a better understanding of the number of residences with mold infestations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For my last class survey, which garnered about 45 responses, it was really alarming to see that 43 out of 45 people are affected by [mold].

past year and that needs to absolutely change on both sides,” Adam told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The eye rolling, the laughing … the disrespectfulness and the feelings that are created to where certain senators feel like they’re not meant for this role … that’s not how I want any of my senators to feel.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam, now a fourth-year political science major, plans to hit the ground running when Fall Quarter 2019 begins by filling the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/senate-votes-to-open-applications-for-ccs-on-campus-senatorial-vacancies/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two empty</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Senate seats, holding training sessions for senators  and facilitating better engagement between senators and the campus at large. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 70th Senate held its first meeting on May 22 with only 23 senators instead of 25, as an on-campus senatorial seat and College of Creative Studies senatorial seat remained unfilled after Spring Quarter elections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the beginning of her term, Adam was also responsible for the appointment of Off-Campus Senator Tianna White as first Pro-Tempore and On-Campus Senator Austin Foreman as second Pro-Tempore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the immediate goal of fulfilling the empty Senate positions, Adam said her focus will be on training senators in the beginning of the fall quarter as opposed to winter quarter, which is when Adam herself was trained when she was a senator. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Senators [from the 69th Senate] weren’t provided with any sort of training, whether it was on the association, microaggressions — literally any training until the middle of winter quarter… our first half of [the 69th] Senate was just whether or not you had an in with Steven [Ho, former IVP], and you could be his friend enough to get the information,” Adam said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t come in magically knowing anything once you’re elected. So [I want to hold] trainings early and often so that all of the senators are on a level playing field and are able to [perform to] the best of their abilities… [and] have the best resources and knowledge to create change and do the projects they want to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another goal of Adam’s over the course of her term is for senators to change the way they interact with their respective Boards, Committees and Units (BCUs). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As IVP, Adam “serve[s] as the official overseer and reference for all interactions between the Senate Liaisons and their BCU’s,” and must “train the Senators in how to be liaisons,” according to A.S. Legal Code. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam told senate liaisons during their May 29 meeting that they should strive to “individualize” their approach to BCUs by working “smarter, not harder” to address the needs of each organization individually.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">[Back to top]</a></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Wiggins has since been released. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first report of a residential burglary came in around 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive, according to a press release sent out by Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) Sergeant Daniel Calderon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the police arrived at the location, the woman who reported the burglary also “located items stolen from her home inside of a Dodge Ram truck that was parked in front of her residence.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After approaching Wiggins, Scypino and Williams, who were near the truck, police arrested the three. Police then located more of the woman’s stolen property in the three suspects’ backpacks, along with additional property that had been stolen in a separate burglary earlier that morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The victims of the early morning burglary “reported that they were at home asleep while that crime occured.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of Sunday night, police tied together four burglaries that happened in I.V. over the course of the weekend, according to SBSO Sergeant Jarom Kemp. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When deputies started inventorying recovered property, they were able to link many of the burglaries together,” Kemp said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In some cases, entry into the dwelling was forced. In others, they gained entry by knowing ‘friends of friends.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of the items stolen were electronics, he explained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News of the burglaries raised concern about the chaos of move-out weekend in I.V., as many students tend to leave their doors unlocked during the process and out-of-town visitors are not uncommon due to graduation ceremonies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some students took to the Facebook group Free &amp; For Sale to warn people about the burglaries, while others discussed the hectic nature that comes with UCSB’s graduation since many students’ leases in I.V. end around that same weekend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One I.V. landlord who runs </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/from-dp-rentals-to-playa-life-i-v-40-isla-vista-properties-under-new-management/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playa Life I.V.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Erin Eliza, posted on Facebook about move-out weekend, calling it a “toxic environment” and “Christmas for Criminals.” She also called for UCSB to have more authority over move-in weekend, referencing the university’s restrictions during Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She noted in the comments on her post that “1⁄2 the homes we own have had their bikes etc stolen.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stolen property collected by police from the three suspects is being held at the I.V. Foot Patrol. Individuals can contact the I.V.

a payroll system meant to streamline the way payroll functions, was implemented on UCSB and other UC campuses throughout the course of 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program’s website promises “Efficient, accurate payroll” — but since UC Path’s implementation, students across the UC have complained about delayed, missed or wrong pay, causing tension between the administration and students at the UC’s perceived inaction in fixing UCPath issues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For most employers, not paying workers on time is a form of wage theft — but the University of California is currently exempt from the state’s strict wage theft laws,” a press release sent out by United Auto Workers Union (UAW) on Friday stated. UAW </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-05/union-workers-protest-ucpath-implementation-payment-issues/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">held a rally in March 2019</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to protest the implementation of UCPath. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAW President Kavitha Iyengar said in the press release that the union is “encouraged” and “looking forward” to seeing the bill move onto the Assembly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because there is no penalty for this, UC chose to use its own workers as an interest-free bank as they worked out the system’s glitches. Without accountability measures in place, we have no doubt that UC will continue to take advantage of workers who have no legal recourse,” Iyengar said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In February 2019, the UC Office of the President </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-25/uc-will-offer-additional-payment-to-those-affected-by-ucpath/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">took its first steps towards addressing the issue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of missed payments, offering varying amounts of money to approximately 750 workers who had been affected by UC Path. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill 698, co-authored by Senator Connie Leyva and Senator Scott Wiener, takes a step beyond the offered compensation and would make it a requirement for the UC system to pay its workers on time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California law requires that employees be paid twice a month on designated “regular pay days”; workers classified as executive, administrative or professional employees can be paid once a month.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If passed through the California State Assembly and signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would require that university employees who are paid on a monthly basis be paid “no later than 5 days after the close of the monthly payroll period.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the bill would require the university to create payroll regulations for employees who are paid on a “more frequent basis.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating current California payment law results in a misdemeanor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the UC doesn’t pay workers “on time and on a regular payday,” employees can file a claim in state court or with the Labor Commissioner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, UC Path serves UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC Merced, UC Riverside, UCOP and UCSB. UC Regents plan to implement UCPath at the rest of the UC campuses over the next several years, according to the bill.</span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 30, 2019 version of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Community Services District (I.V. CSD) directors voted unanimously to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9E_iYyJ9UF5lbtD0vLNb5y8X4qHc62x3Hb-xQ4J2n8/edit\">send a letter to the UCPD</a>, stating the district “supports a comprehensive independent investigation into these allegations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The letter further calls for UCPD to hold “a community meeting in order to hear from the public and community members who have been hurt by many of the disturbing allegations.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tuesday night’s discussion primarily centered on transparency regarding the allegations, with Board President Spencer Brandt stating he was “disgusted” when he read about the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an incredibly important issue that is very pertinent to us,” Brandt said, referring to the district’s partnerships and relationships with the UCPD Community Service Officers (CSOs) and the UCPD Interpersonal Violence Investigator position. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is incredibly important for the public to know how their police department is operating… When allegations like this are made from law enforcement officers against their law enforcement agency and against each other, you just damage the trust that students and residents have for law enforcement. It damages the trust that everyone has with all law enforcement.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I.V. CSD Director Ethan Bertrand said he was “struck” by UCPD’s response to reports of the allegations, which he said “was their interim chief saying that ‘We must move past this as a community.’” Bertrand said UCPD first needs to address the concerns of the community before it can move on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I agree that we must move past this as a community, but I also believe that we can make that statement after there’s been an investigation and after they’ve engaged with the community,” Bertrand said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaders from sexual assault violence and harassment advocacy groups Standing Together Against Sexual Assault (STESA) and UCSB’s Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA) also presented statements at the meeting which reflected their concerns and disappointment in the department.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsa Granados, executive director for STESA, spoke as a representative for the sexual assault advocacy group, stating that she fully supports the I.V. CSD’s letter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If the allegations are true, I feel saddened and disappointed,” Granados said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados also made a point to acknowledge the work she believes UCPD has done well, while also calling out those who — “if the allegations are true” — were quiet about the misconduct in the department. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sexual violence thrives on that silence… and I know UCPD has been working very hard to make inroads to ending sexual assault, so that cover-up, those allegations, we cannot tolerate.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granados added that UCPD needs to “work with our entire community to hold those involved accountable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three members from SASA – Emily Montalvo-Telford, Alya Ruiz and Sreya Subramanyan  — read aloud statements regarding the allegations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the majority of those who spoke were from the community, only one police officer, I.V. Foot Patrol station commander Juan Camarena of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO), spoke during the meeting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Camarena assured the community that he “keeps his people accountable” and that police officers are there to serve the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I just want to assure you that we’re here for you, that even though you feel that we have broken that trust, I want you guys to reach out to us. We are still here for you and anything that we could do to rebuild that trust, please let us know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the closing discussion, I.V. CSD Director Robert Geis stressed the implications of the allegations for the department if proven true. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The department cannot be silent on this.

Going in, she believed “people just knew what this office does… but in reality, I found out that besides going to Senate meetings and talking to various orgs, they had no idea what this office was.”</p>\n<p>She said her “biggest success” was kickstarting a plan to get the bike shop a permanent location on campus, a task she has been working on throughout the school year. Approximately $3 million is budgeted for the project so far, she said, noting that the bike shop is something that the majority of campus utilizes.</p>\n<p>Because the project is still in its early stages – Kopel presented the shop’s plans at Wednesday night’s Senate meeting – it will ultimately be up to President-elect Alison Sir to see the project through its entirety.</p>\n<p>In regards to the tuition hike, Kopel said she was “blessed” that the UC Regents listened to the students on lobby trips in that they decided not to raise in-state tuition for the 2018-2019 school year.</p>\n<p>She noted that she herself has gone on two different lobby trips over the past year, one to DC and another to the student lobby conference in Sacramento, lobbying for Pell Grant and Cal Grant expansion.</p>\n<p>Kopel also praised the work the EVPSA office has done <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-02-08/evpsa-position-will-remain-vacant-until-spring-elections-board-says/\">without an actual EVPSA</a> , highlighting its efforts with Coffee and Calls and on the several lobby trips throughout the year.</p>\n<p>She referenced the latest out-of-state resident tuition hike that was on the UC Regents’s table, noting that her office, in conjunction with the EVPSA office, “mobilized to get people out [there and] make it definitely aware that [the tuition hike] was happening.”</p>\n<p>She also met with UC President Janet Napolitano once a quarter, along with all of the other UC undergraduate student presidents, and said she was proud that during every single meeting, they “addressed tuition hikes and basic needs and college affordability.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve talked about that every single time and made it aware to the [UC] president that the council of presidents won’t stand for anything less than making college more and more affordable.”</p>\n<p>In regards to the natural disaster relief fund, Kopel said she found it difficult to “navigate the administration” and what routes to take when looking for sources of money.</p>\n<p>She explained that during this past year, she rediscovered an A.S. Excellence Fund that had been created by 2013-2014 A.S. President Jonathan Abboud during his time as president. The fund, made up entirely by alumni donations, was meant to be used for “bettering the academic experience of students.”</p>\n<p>The vague description means the fund can be put toward a large variety of uses, Kopel said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the fund has approximately $2,000 in it and has not yet been used. Kopel is currently working on getting more money into the fund so it can help students facing financial crisis from natural disasters in the future.</p>\n<p>“I’m really hoping that by the end of the quarter, we’ll be able to reach that $10,000 mark at the fund, and that at that point it will become an endowment and can start generating its funds,” she said. “Even if I don’t reach that $10,000 goal [by the end of the quarter]… Alison will be able to pick it up really easily next year.”</p>\n<p>In regards to helping sexual assault suvivors, Kopel referenced her work with Students Against Sexual Assault (SASA), stating that she did “a lot of work with them” in Fall Quarter 2018 by helping with the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/sasa-releases-list-of-asks-plans-to-approach-ucsb-administration/\">Asks</a> they put together.</p>\n<p>Aside from tangible projects, Kopel said she believed her role throughout the past year on this campus was to be visible, to help connect marginalized communities and those advocating on campus “with the people that they really need to get their efforts seen [by].”</p>\n<p>“When it comes to supporting communities and specifically the survivor community, there’s already so much work that’s going on that I don’t want to co-op or take credit for or change [what they’re doing] because they’re so strong.”</p>\n<p>Kopel said that as the first woman president in four years – with James Villarreal in 2015-2016, Austin Hechler in 2016-2017 and Hieu Le in 2017-2018 – she felt it was a “responsibility of mine” to do whatever she could to “be supportive and [be] there for survivors and for women.”</p>\n<p>She noted that she was proud of helping set up the Hate and Bias On Campus town hall.</p>\n<p>She further denounced Betsy DeVos’s proposed Title IX changes, stating there has to be “ample protections in place for survivors on UC campuses.”</p>\n<p>One of Kopel’s other platform points, one she referenced during her candidate forum, was “uniting the campus.” In that, Kopel said “uniting the campus,” for her, means “standing up for people who are unseen by this campus or underrepresented, or never heard enough.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve written letters for, spoke up for, gone to meeting with, spoken on a system wide level to the [UC] president [for underrepresented communities],” she said.</p>\n<p>“[I’ve gone] out to strikes, whether it be for AFSCMEor the Pan Asian Network, using my platform to uplift those voices that aren’t heard enough is a way to show as many people on campus as possible that these communities are in need, that these communities need support more than they’re getting.”</p>\n<p><strong>Nonpartisanship: </strong></p>\n<p>She praised the 69th Senate’s success in terms of the bills and resolutions passed; according to Kopel, this year’s Senate put out a “record number” of resolutions and bills, particularly in putting out resolutions that support “various communities” on campus.</p>\n<p>“I think Senate has definitely made it one of their priorities to make sure that they’re standing up for these students… I think there’s a few shining stars in Senate that have made work their priorities, but there’s a lot of others that kind of have been hidden under the brush.”</p>\n<p>But she noted the contentious situation that this year’s Senate brought: “Not only does it feel kind of tense and the air is really thick in there, but you can visually see a divide. You can tell who’s been elected by Campus United and you can tell who’s been elected from the Isla Vista Party.”</p>\n<p>Kopel attributed that fault and toxicity to both parties.</p>\n<p>“Partisanship and toxicity and harmful words and attacks get in the way of work we’re supposed to be doing.”</p>\n<p>Kopel was also tasked during her presidency with <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-11-30/vacant-judicial-council-seats-filled-nine-weeks-after-quarter-begins/\">filling four vacant Judicial Council seats</a> – an unprecedented situation in recent UCSB student government history, and one that caused “uproar” within the Senate as Kopel presented her chosen appointments.</p>\n<p>“I was heavily affiliated with Campus United [at the time] and the Senate was split [on Judicial Council appointments], 50-50,” Kopel said, referencing the Judicial Council cases on the table at the time regarding her former party.</p>\n<p>“I think at first [the process] was hostile, but I think I did a very good job in being level-headed and open-minded and very open to their suggestions.”</p>\n<p>Kopel also noted that this past election season was more “hostile” than her year’s election had been, stating it was “really disheartening for me,” referencing, in her words, the “anti-Black” and “transphobic” comments made toward former A.S. presidential candidate Zion Solomon on a UCSB Reddit thread.</p>\n<p>“I know elections get really tense. I’ve been through two of them myself and I know people want to win, they want to help this campus, they want to represent students, but that should never come at the expense of someone else’s safety… It’s one thing to critique a platform and it’s another thing to hate on someone’s identity.”</p>\n<p>In reference to the “hostile” nature of elections, Kopel said she has “mixed feelings” about the presence of political parties on campus. While she believes the parties provide platforms for people who “might not have the means otherwise to run for positions,” ultimately, “the negatives outweigh the positives.”</p>\n<p>“Our campus is just a little microcosm of what our federal system looks like –– even though, by no means, is CU or IVP Democrat or Republican –– just having that split from having two parties lends itself to toxicity,” she said.</p>\n<p>“It lends itself to a divide that might not necessarily have to be there if everyone had to run independent or if there was some sort of system where there had to be more than two parties involved.”</p>\n<p>She also <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-30/associated-students-ivp-and-evpsa-elect-removed-from-isla-vista-party/\">touched lightly on her departure from Campus United</a> during Fall Quarter 2018, stating that while she did as much as she could to communicate that departure with the student body, it was ultimately hard to address her departure because parties “aren’t really supposed to be present throughout the course of the year,” as stated in A.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p><strong>What Comes Next?</strong></p>\n<p>Kopel will be attending law school at the University of Southern California after she graduates with UCSB’s class of 2019. She hopes to become an immigration lawyer.</p>\n<p>She said her time in the Office of the Student Advocate (OSA), working as a caseworker during her second year at UCSB, was where she “found [her] voice for advocacy.”</p>\n<p>“I was able, as a caseworker, to see the impact I was able to have just on a small scale, but also on such a big scale on individual’s lives… my passion for advocacy has only grown since then.”</p>\n<p>But it was the presidential office in particular that “showed me that advocacy doesn’t necessarily mean having some huge movement accomplished. For me to be a successful advocate it doesn’t mean that I step into the game and get all the demands put through,” emphasizing that, to her, advocacy means “being visible and knowing that people are there for you.”</p>\n<p>In regards to her successor, Sir, Kopel said she hoped to make Sir’s transition into office easier that her own: “The transition was really scary for me. I felt really alone at first… a big priority of mine this year was to try and bridge the gap of transitions that we face every year.”</p>\n<p>But aside from the transition, Kopel’s advice for Sir is: “You have the utmost privilege of serving in this office, of meeting administration and cultivating relations with people you had no idea existed, communities you had no idea existed. Take advantage of literally every email that comes your way, every opportunity that comes your way, get to know this campus in and out.”</p>\n<p>“Treat every day like it’s your first, because it’s never too late to start something new.”</p>\n<p><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">A version of this article appeared on page 3 of the May 16, 2019 print edition of the </span></em><span class=\"_5yl5\">Daily Nexus</span><em><span class=\"_5yl5\">.</span></em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

As an “alternative,” the $3.33 per quarter fee was proposed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/58384528_321304875200897_6072833742202732544_n.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1218723404\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"87908\">“in order to continue providing night and weekend parking for students.”</a></p>\n<p>For the next five years, until around 2008, the permits were provided to students at no additional cost other than the $3.33 fee, according to Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) Director Nestor Covarrubias.</p>\n<p>But it’s 2019, and students are still paying that $3.33 per quarter fee – without the free night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>For the past 11 years, students have had to pay money on top of the $3.33 per quarter fee if they want night and weekend parking.</p>\n<p>The $3.33 fee is currently being used to “partially cover” the full cost of a night and weekend parking permit, which stands at $160 for community members and $52.50 for students for three quarters, Covarrubias said in an email to the <i>Nexus.</i></p>\n<p>If that fee went away, students would pay the full $160, he confirmed.</p>\n<p>It was the discovery that the initial ballot language promised students “free” night and weekend parking that prompted A.S. President Brooke Kopel to post on her personal Facebook on April 22, encouraging UCSB students to vote no on the TPS $3.33 reaffirmation fee that was on the Spring Quarter 2019 ballot.</p>\n<p>“I have attempted to re-implement this free night and weekend parking that TPS has promised us. In conversations with A.S. staff, I have discovered that over the years since this lock-in was passed, TPS claims that the $3.33 fee is just no longer enough to supplement free night and weekend parking due to their own institutional growth and expansion,” Kopel said in the post.</p>\n<p>“BUT that is not what YOU pay for. YOU pay for FREE night and weekend parking. Not subsidized night and weekend parking.”</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <i>Nexus</i>, Kopel explained that her predecessor, former A.S. President Hieu Le, attempted to “strong arm” TPS into providing students with free night and weekend parking toward the end of his term by asking A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez not to give TPS the money collected by student fees.</p>\n<p>Once Kopel took office, she said she was told by Márquez that A.S. cannot legally withhold that money from TPS.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s ballot language that was voted on and approved by the student body that this money will be paid to TPS, even though they’re not giving exactly what the ballot language says, Marisela can’t just withhold funds that students voted on giving to a department,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s really, really irresponsible of Associated Students to be letting students pay $10 a year for a service they are not receiving. $10 could be a few meals, $10 could go to rent, $10 could go to gas, to books.”</p>\n<p>This past Thursday, the fee was reaffirmed with 3901 yeses, or 71.79%, and 1533 noes, or 28.21%. It cannot be voted on again until Spring Quarter 2021.</p>\n<p>If A.S. was “open to the idea,” Covarrubias said, “TPS could come up with an updated rate to provide the undergraduate Night &amp; Weekend permit at no additional cost.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Updated [1:15 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
