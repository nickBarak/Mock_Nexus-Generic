Deputies then “observed that [Mendoza] had a knife in his back pocket,” Hoover said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Hoover, Mendoza was “argumentative and uncooperative.” He returned to the group and “despite orders that he was being detained, he ignored deputies and attempted to incite the other subjects to walk away and leave,” Hoover said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mendoza “delayed the investigation,” which resulted in additional police units arriving on the scene to safely detain the subjects, Hoover said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was booked at the Santa Barbara Jail at approximately 9:56 p.m. on a $2,500 bail, according to arrest logs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no student by the name of Marco Mendoza in UC Santa Barbara’s student directory.</span></p>\n<p>Mendoza is not currently a student at Santa Barbara City College and has never registered for classes there, according to SBCC spokesperson Luz Reyes-Martin.</p>\n<p><i>Updated at 9:02 a.m.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

President Hieu Le began gathering signatures for the project during the week of Feb. 26. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The University Center Renovation Project will be on the Associated Students spring elections ballot, according to A.S. President Hieu Le, who has been petitioning to get the project on the ballot over the past three weeks.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had the fortunate opportunity to speak with thousands of students on this campus,” Le said. “Now, students will be given that opportunity to decide the future of our campus and for the future of tomorrow’s generation.”</p>\n<p>Approximately 3,500 undergraduate students signed the petition, according to Le. In order to get the project on the ballot, Le needed to collect 3,116 signatures by the March 16 deadline.</p>\n<p>“[The number] is well above the mark that we needed to be, which only shows that there is a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of support from the campus, from the student body, around this proposal,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The project, a collaboration between A.S., the Division of Student Affairs and the University Center (UCen) Governance Board, was introduced as a resolution to the A.S. Senate during a Jan. 31 <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/student-fees-may-spike-with-ucen-remodel/\">Senate meeting</a>, where it was tabled indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Senate passed a second resolution later than night, affirming support for the project. Le and volunteers began petitioning the ballot during the week of Feb. 26.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to hear what [students’] concerns are about their day to day issues, but at the same time we’ve been able to present this exciting and thrilling opportunity for students to consider voting for the UCen renovation expansion,” Le said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board and career staff members involved in the elections process verified the number of signatures and student perm numbers to make sure that each is valid, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“In our process we’ve been very diligent in the educational process in ensuring that students are informed about the issue, about the benefits and also what it would cost, and what the investment would be,” he said.</p>\n<p>Le said he and others who gathered signatures were “transparent” when petitioning to students.</p>\n<p>“Our process holds the highest standards of integrity,” he said.</p>\n<p>The petition outlines a need for a 24-hour study space, an innovation laboratory, a health and wellness center, additional Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) classrooms, expanded mental health peer counseling for Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), the expansion of the A.S. Food Bank, a campus pub and infrastructure upgrades for the UCen.</p>\n<p>“When we think of facilities such as the [Student Resource Building], or the [Recreation Center], facilities financed primarily by student investment dollars, it was students 10, 20, 30 years ago who decided to make this happen for us today, for us to have access to those resources,” Le said.</p>\n<p>The project needs 50 percent + 1 “yes” votes for it to be implemented.</p>\n<p>If students vote in favor of the project, a $21.42 quarterly fee will be added to student fees until Fall 2022. Between fall 2022 and fall 2052, an additional $99.61 a quarter will be added to the fees, though that cost will progressively increase each year to match inflation.</p>\n<p>If passed, construction on the project will be completed by fall 2022. Additional fees will continue until 2052, according to the petition.</p>\n<p>Officials initially stated that the renovation would cost $48 million, but students would <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucen/\">pay more</a> to fund the project.</p>\n<p>“I think this is something that each student will have to weigh themselves and see whether or not this is needed for our campus,” Le said. “But I myself am very supportive, and I’m supportive of the right for student autonomy to decide for themselves whether this should proceed or not.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-81874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">“We’ve actually crossed off all the names of the students who mistakenly signed onto that petition, mistaking it for the food bank sign-in sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” Le said. <em>Photo submitted anonymously</em></p></div>\n<p>“The petition misled since it was stating that it was mainly meant for the expansion of the Food Bank without clearly stating of the expansion of the UCen by increasing student fees,” advisor Rodolfo Ortiz said at the Food Bank Committee’s meeting.</p>\n<p>“The petition was put next to the sign-in sheet which caused students to mistake between the forms,” Vice Chair Tabitha Yuen said at the meeting.</p>\n<p>The minutes reference the petition as having been “set-up by Hieu Le at the Food Bank lounge last week.”</p>\n<p>Le, however, did not respond when asked if he had set up the petition in the food bank himself.</p>\n<p>Le acknowledged that the petition had been placed “next to the sign-in sheet for the actual food bank.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve actually crossed off all the names of the students who mistakenly signed onto that petition, mistaking it for the food bank sign-in sheet … We were able to move that sign-in sheet,” he said.</p>\n<p>The committee voted to “disapprove” the UCen expansion petition in the food bank during the March 2 meeting, meaning they will no longer allow the petition to be placed within the bank, according to first-year history major James Ferraro.</p>\n<p>“The ballot language is long and extensive … What I would argue is that people aren’t going to look through it in depth, people are going to vote for things and not see it, and so people are going to pass a fee raise,” Ferraro said.</p>\n<p>Funding for the project will come from a combination of student fees, the university itself and an alumni donation fund, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’ve raised about $2.5 million on campus equities, not donors yet,” Le said. “There is an anticipation that we’re gonna raise quite a good amount, but we don’t have a certain figure in mind yet.”</p>\n<p>Senator Alexandra Gessesse and Dumlao both said Le and his fellow students have not been open regarding fees when approaching students about the petition.</p>\n<p>“Not only have I witnessed [this], but constituents have told me that they’re not being told the fact that their student fees are going to be increased,” Gessesse said.</p>\n<p>“The issue is, even if we get donors and we assume that they’re going to give us $10 million, there’s still a budget that needs to be covered that would be from the student expense,” she added.</p>\n<p>Dumlao explained the project is being publicized as expanding the food bank and improving the UCen rather than focusing on the fact that student fees will rise.</p>\n<p>“I’ve heard from multiple people, both people who have been asked to sign the petition and … people who Hieu has been soliciting to work with him, that they have been told not to say or explicitly mention right off the bat that student fees will be raised if you sign that,” he said.</p>\n<p>Le denied not fully explaining the petition to students.</p>\n<p>“The cost is reflected in the petition, and our process is to hold the highest standards of integrity,” Le said. “Students at this university are very smart, and they know what they’re signing and they know what the idea is. Our job is to educate them on the process.”</p>\n<p>According to the petition, the UCen is now more than 50 years old, was designed to accommodate 17,000 students and was last updated in 1994. Currently, UCSB has more than 25,000 students and 6,800 faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>It is projected that 28,000 students will be enrolled by 2025, the petition says.</p>\n<p>“These facilities can no longer support the needs of our growing community, nor are they designed to keep up with the ever-changing and increasing technological demands of the current generation,” the petition reads.</p>\n<p>The project was first proposed six years ago, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“All three sponsors, A.S., the Division of Student Affairs and the University Center worked and consulted with students, clubs and organizations,” Le said. “The Office of Budget &amp; Planning was the one who drafted the [current] proposal.”</p>\n<p>If the petition is placed on the ballot and students vote in favor of it, student fees will increase $21.42 per quarter during Fall Quarter 2018. The increase will remain an additional $21.42 per quarter until Fall Quarter 2022, at which point it will increase to a “maximum” of $99.61 per quarter, including summer, according to Le.</p>\n<p>“We’re addressing an overcrowded campus; students are competing against each other for spots, spots inside the classroom; people are sitting in the aisles; students are waiting two weeks to see a psychological or academic counselor,” Le said.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, what we’re looking at is that students are competing against each other for spots, rather than we’re not addressing the issue in terms of providing access, and fair access, to each and every single one of our campus community [members],” he added.</p>\n<p>The petition needs 3,116 signatures to be placed on the ballot for students to vote on during Spring Quarter, according to Le. The deadline to get these signatures is March 16 and as of Wednesday night, the petition has approximately 2,000 signatures.</p>\n<p><em>Shomik Mukherjee contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Gessesse said “constituents,” not “kids.”</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the March 8 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

We’re in a system that doesn’t allow us to fully exercise our rights and benefit from the things we deserve,” third-year Chicanx studies major Jose Sanchez said.</p>\n<p>“I am very proud of our students and community today,” Office of Student Life Associate Director Danielle Quinones said in an email.</p>\n<p>She explained that she originally asked students not to enter Cheadle Hall because of the “safety of the participants” due to the building’s “compact” corridors, but later was “proud to hear their voices echo throughout the building.”</p>\n<p>Protesters chanted several phrases while marching, including, “Undocumented, unafraid,” “Education, not deportation,” “No ban, no wall, sanctuary for all,” “The people united will never be divided” and “Ain’t no power like the power of the people, because the power of the people don’t stop.”</p>\n<p>“I thought I was always part of the same society, but then you realize when you go to school that you don’t have healthcare, you don’t have Medicaid, [and] if queer people get HIV you don’t get money for that either,” Sanchez said.</p>\n<p>Protesters also created several signs for the protest, some of which read, “Keep families together,” “No borders, no walls, #end I.C.E.,” “Borders are a lie,” “Here to stay” and “Education not deportation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81771\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81771\" data-attachment-id=\"81771\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-05/ucsb-students-faculty-protest-for-immigration-reform/ucsb-students-protests-against-trump-administrations-immigrant-policy-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?fit=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"UCSB Students protests against Trump Administration’s immigrant policy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-81771 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ImmigrationProtest-030518-SichengWang-2-copy.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-81771\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Protesters marched through the Arbor walkway on their way to Cheadle Hall. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was scheduled for termination on Monday, but a <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/supreme-court-declines-trumps-appeal-to-review-federal-daca-court-case/\">Supreme Court ruling</a> in late February ensured that current DACA recipients can continue applying for renewals as a University of California lawsuit against the Donald Trump administration continues.</p>\n<p>Several signs referenced Congressman Salud Carbajal, stating that he “voted no on DACA” and is “against DREAMERS.”</p>\n<p>In January, Carbajal <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/uc-california-to-support-undocumented-students-despite-daca-repeal/\">voted for a spending bill</a> that would have prevented a government shutdown over DACA.

Senators Sophia Dycaico and Brooke Kopel authored the resolution, and Brant and fellow Lobby Corps member Madeline Loudon student-sponsored the resolution.</p>\n<p>In January, students across the UC system traveled to the UC regents meeting to protest the proposed tuition hike. Brandt and several other UCSB students were present when the regents voted to postpone the vote until May.</p>\n<p>“A lot of regents were convinced that the UC should lobby the state for more funding before raising the tuition, so we’re at a really important opportunity where we could actually get more funding from the state,” Dycaico said. “That could stop the tuition hike.”</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, the cost of college has risen “dramatically” over the past 30 years, “outpacing the cost of medical care, real estate, child care and household appliances” and “forcing 55% of UC students to take on thousands of dollars in loans.”</p>\n<p>“Tuition is — if not the number one problem — one of the largest problems that students face,” Kopel said.</p>\n<p>She added that “college is already too expensive” and said that the resolution will help pressure the UC Regents and Governor Brown to stop the tuition hikes and to create a federal budget that works in the students’ interests.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, the California governor’s 2018-2019 budget proposal does not including “adequate funding” for enrollment growth, psychological counselors, facility maintenance, student resources, health services, research equipment, academic tutoring and other needs.</p>\n<p>The UC receives the “same inflation-adjusted amount of funding from the State of California than it did in 2000, despite enrolling 90,000 more students in 2017 than it did in 2000,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>The resolution calls for the California State Assembly, the California State Senate and the Governor of California to appropriate $10 million in funding to support the costs of education for an additional 2,500 students that the UC is required to enroll next year.</p>\n<p>Also requested are $35 million for “instruction and research facilities maintenance projects” and $71 million to supplement the proposition tuition and fee increase.</p>\n<p>Brandt said that proposed funding numbers in the resolution came from a 2018-2019 UC budget request submitted in February.</p>\n<p>The request states that funding is needed for “urgent projects” on campus, including fixing classrooms and updating labs. The university is also requesting funds to help deal with larger class sizes, the student to faculty ratio and increased demand on student services.</p>\n<p>“The investment will fund improvements to ensure student success and timely graduation,” the request states.</p>\n<p>The UC’s backlog exceeds $4 billion and is the third largest among all state agencies, according to the request.</p>\n<p>With the passing of the resolution, “We’re going to be doing a lot more in terms of letter writing, postcard writing, making calls. We’re definitely going to include in [the letters] that our campus stands behind these asks,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 5 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-81450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In light of the recent mass shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, Santa Barbara students and lawmakers are calling for a significant change in gun policies to prevent more senseless deaths. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>“People are tired of thoughts and prayers, and people want to see action. It may not be typical for a vigil to so quickly become political action, but it’s necessary right now,” Spencer Brandt, Community Services District board secretary, said.</p>\n<p>After a former student entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and killed 17 people with an AR-15, individuals across the country have renewed efforts for “common-sense” gun laws, including Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>“We owe these families more than just our thoughts and prayers,” he said in a statement released the day after the shooting.</p>\n<p>Brandt, with CSD President Ethan Bertrand and Associated Students (A.S.) External Vice President Batsheva Labowe-Stoll, organized a vigil for the Parkland shooting on Feb. 21.</p>\n<p>“[We] organized the vigil for Parkland, standing in solidarity with them because gun violence is absolutely a scourge on our country,” Brandt said. “In Isla Vista, we are inextricably linked to gun violence because of the tragedy in 2014.”</p>\n<p>Bertrand, Brandt, Labowe-Stoll, A.S. President Hieu Le and several other UC Santa Barbara students signed letters to President Trump during the vigil, urging him to pass “common-sense” gun control measures.</p>\n<p>Brandt said proposed laws, such as the one that would allow firearms to be removed from individuals in a state of crisis, is a “common-sense fix that will save lives.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after the Florida shooting, Carbajal, with Representatives Elizabeth Esty and Don Beyer, released a statement urging the passing of H.R. 2598, which would allow family members or law enforcement officials to petition a judge to remove firearms from an individual in crisis.</p>\n<p>“No parent should send their children to school each day wondering if they will return home. We are once again reminded that we have a responsibility to act in Congress to change things,” Carbajal said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Carbajal spoke at a UCSB Campus Democrats meeting on Feb. 20, explaining that he had first introduced H.R. 2598 in May 2017.</p>\n<p>“We have a majority Republican leadership right now … There’s very little chance for common sense gun safety laws to move forward,” he said during the meeting. “Anything that helps us create a safer country and safer communities might be a good thing.”</p>\n<p>Restrictions on purchasing a gun vary from state to state.</p>\n<p>In California, a person must be 18 years old to purchase a rifle or a shotgun and 21 to purchase a handgun, according to the California attorney general’s website. California law states that there must be a 10-day waiting period before the firearm can be “released” to the purchaser.</p>\n<p>The purchaser must also provide evidence of identity and age, and handgun purchasers must provide proof of California residency. “Large-capacity magazines,” or guns that accept more than 10 rounds, are illegal in California as of Jan. 1, 2000.</p>\n<p>Any person who has been convicted for a felony or has been “held involuntarily as a danger to self or others” is prohibited from buying, possessing or owning firearms or ammunition.</p>\n<p>As of Jan. 1, 2018, the kind of weapon used in the Florida shooting cannot be bought in California.</p>\n<p>“It’s really important to remember that the people leading this right now aren’t gun [control] advocacy groups … it’s the students. It’s the students in Parkland who were in the building when one of their former classmates came in with an AR-15 and starting shooting,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>He said the students’ response to the shooting is a “cry for help.”</p>\n<p>“They should be the ones who should be remembered as getting the momentum going if we actually get something to happen this time around,” he said.</p>\n<p>Several vigils for victims of mass shootings have been held at UCSB. The most recent one was a Nov. 7 vigil for the victims of the Sutherland, Texas shooting.</p>\n<p>“This is about gun violence in the community and seeing the leaders that in higher officials than us act responsibly. As an elected official, I’m ashamed that there are others who are acting in such a way to undermine just the basic safety of people in our country,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 22, 2018 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

He later only found out the union was involved when money for the union was taken out of his paycheck.</p>\n<p>“The union voice is not my voice. The union’s fight is not my fight. But a piece of my paycheck every week still goes to the union,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>He wrote that he took his job because he cares about kids, but said he no longer wants to pay union dues.</p>\n<p>He added that he is not anti-union, but that “unions aren’t a fit for everyone. And I shouldn’t be forced to pay money to a union if I don’t think it does a good job representing my interests.”</p>\n<p>Tom Steel, a third-year philosophy, ethics and public policy major and Teamster 2010 Student Organizer, said <em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME </em>would allow non-union members to “free-ride off the negotiating efforts of the union that everybody else pays into,” because labor unions are legally bound to represent them.</p>\n<p>Steel explained that non-unionized workers currently pay fair share fees that cover the cost of the bargaining contract that the workers benefit from, and that the case would make it so that individuals not represented by a union would no longer have to pay fees.</p>\n<p>“Free riders still have to be represented by the union. So if the free-riders have any grievances or any other issues like that, the union still has to expand resources to cover those members, even though those free-riders do not pay anything into the union whatsoever,” he added.</p>\n<p>Public sector union laws differ slightly from private sector unions, Young said. Public sector unions are funded by taxpayers, while private sector unions are funded by business entities.</p>\n<p><em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em> would affect public sectors unions. Private sector unions would not be similarly affected.</p>\n<p>“There’s two sets of labor laws. One way to think of it is the private sector is governed by a national labor law, whereas the public section is done state by state. We fall under the California State Labor Law Code, the teamsters who work at UCSB and other unions too,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Teamsters 2010 is statewide and covers all 10 UC campuses as well as the CSU campuses, according to Young.</p>\n<p>Young explained that when a similar law was passed in Wisconsin recently, public sector workers’ wages immediately decreased, and even the non-unionized workers saw their wages go down.</p>\n<p>“This just really hurts the whole economy because here at UCSB we’re the largest employer in Santa Barbara. Undercut my wages, then I’m not going to be able to shop locally, right, I’m just going to have to subsist on the bare minimum,” he said.</p>\n<p>Right now, unions act as a check on workplace safety issues and workplace discrimination, Steel said.</p>\n<p>“[Unions are] able to do that because they have the financial resources to provide resources for their members, to provide legal guidance to establish a fair and equitable workplace,” he said. “If the unions lose this financial backing, because free-riders won’t pay into the union, not only will they lose their strength, but this check on the employer is going to be diminished.”</p>\n<p>He explained that if <em>Janus</em> v. <em>AFSCME</em> is passed, employees could face challenges similar to those from the late 1800s and early 1900s, where “employees did not have a voice that was able to combat the whims of the employer.”</p>\n<p>“The bottom line is that this would weaken unions, and it would diminish the roles that unions have in their ability to protect their workers,” Steel said.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court will hear opening arguments for the case on Feb. 26.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 3 of the Feb. 15 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>According to the resolution, numerous students have been removed from housing due to their mental disabilities. The resolution reads that disability discrimination is “an issue that constantly looms over UCSB students” and calls for the alteration or removal of the “Personal Care” clause in the UCSB housing contract.</p>\n<p>The “Personal Care Clause,” located under the Personal Care section of the housing contract, states that “residents are responsible for their own self-care and personal needs.”</p>\n<p>“UCSB Residential and Community living claims to ‘value diversity and inclusivity,’ but actively removes/refuses students who are neuroatypical without alternative housing options, contributing to disability discrimination within housing, student housing insecurity, and poor mental health,” the resolution reads.</p>\n<p>The resolution was authored by Senator Alison Sir and Senator Anthony Pimentel and was developed and finalized on Jan. 23, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>“I felt a resolution was the most efficient solution to make a plan of action by creating a committee and working on this issue head on,” Sir said.</p>\n<p>She added that the students who brought the issue to her attention would like to remain anonymous due to the “extremity and sensitivity of this particular issue.”</p>\n<p>Pimentel said that the issue was first brought to Sir and she asked him to be the co-author. Students with a mental disability are part of a community that is oftentimes “overlooked,” Pimentel said.</p>\n<p>“When this type of mistreatment to a community occurs, I find it necessary and critical that, as a student leader, I do all that I can to hold the people responsible for their mistreatment to a community of students who need the most support,” he said.</p>\n<p>The resolution states that the “personal care” clause should be eliminated and a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities should be created.</p>\n<p>The Senate demands that UCSB Housing include a new clause dedicated to students with disabilities because “citing C.A.P.S. is not acceptable.”</p>\n<p>The UCSB Housing contract states that Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through 805-893-4411.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the contract states that C.A.P.S. offers a large range of services, including crisis intervention, individual and group counseling, psychological assessment, stress management and referrals to outside agencies.</p>\n<p>The Senate resolution, however, states that C.A.P.S. is prevented from “being an adequate source of relief for students with short- and long-term mental illnesses” because only a limited number of appointments can be provided for each student.</p>\n<p>The resolution adds that C.A.P.S. is “severely understaffed.”</p>\n<p>Sir said she and Pimentel are currently planning to have a meeting with C.A.P.S. to discuss the program and the concerns outlined in the resolution.</p>\n<p>The clause “provides much gray area for Housing and Residential Services to work with in illegally excluding mentally ill students from UCSB Housing,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>Currently, it is “considered reasonable” for UCSB Housing to remove or reject individuals who have a history of mental instability and who are not currently being treated to “mitigate the mental instability,” according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>On-campus housing is held to different standards than other landlord-tenant relationships as a government community-based housing entity.</p>\n<p>Pimentel and Sir will be holding a Housing Ad-Hoc Committee Feb. 2 in the Nati conference room from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. to discuss a plan combatting the Personal Care Clause, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Interested students and the general public are invited to attend to share their own experiences or voice their opinions on this issue, Pimentel said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

id=\"caption-attachment-80723\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A.S. President Hieu Le proposed a plan to renovate the UCen building, which could increase student fees by $20 per student per quarter. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The UCen/Student Union Renovation and Expansion project goal is to “address critical building infrastructure needs of the UCen,” according to the first draft of the resolution submitted to Senate.</p>\n<p>The first draft of the resolution was tabled indefinitely, and a new one was passed at the Jan. 31 Senate meeting, reaffirming support for Le’s plan.</p>\n<p>Senator Grecia Martinez authored and Senator Kian Maalizadeh seconded the first draft of the original resolution. Maalizadeh authored and Martinez seconded the Jan. 31 affidavit resolution.</p>\n<p>“I have high hopes for it, and I want other students to believe in it,” Martinez said of Le’s plan.</p>\n<p>A.S. Community Outreach Coordinator James Ferraro spoke against the first resolution during the public forum during Wednesday’s Senate meeting.</p>\n<p>Ferraro, who met with Le earlier, said Le had stated that the project would require a student fee increase that could reach as high as $300 a year beginning in five years. Until then, the project would require a $20 increase per student per quarter.</p>\n<p>“That’s a 48 million dollar project, as I mentioned, and I think it’s a lot to ask from students to pay for the majority of that cost,” Ferraro said. “A lot of students have a very tough financial burden, and every dollar really counts for them.”</p>\n<p>Le declined the <em>Nexus’</em> request for comment, but spoke to the Senate later and confirmed the potential costs of the new project for students.</p>\n<p>He said the project has a $48 million budget which would be funded through a combination of student fees and fundraising, and that the fees would range from $21 to $99 per quarter. The project, however, is still in its preliminary stages; Le will need to collect signatures to get the measure on the ballot for the 2018 A.S. elections.</p>\n<p>He said the plan would include an approximately $50 million return for students with financial aid to supplement the fee for students who could not otherwise afford it.</p>\n<p>Ferraro explained that the current proposal doesn’t include any financial commitment from the university aside from setting up a fundraiser that would solicit funds from alumni donors.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of you really opposed when the UC Regents or when [the] university is really trying to raise our fees and you guys really fight and you’re great leaders on that,” Ferraro said to the senators.</p>\n<p>“But I think when it comes to this and when it comes to internal funding, I think you really have to be careful and really pay attention to what they’re asking for, especially Office of the President,” he added.</p>\n<p>The original resolution references a 2012 space survey which states that “38% of A.S. entities has no assigned space, while a quarter of A.S. entities used temporary or shared spaces. A.S. is located in seven different buildings on campus making it difficult for students to collaborate and integrate their ideas, projects, and communications.”</p>\n<p>The resolution proposed the expansion and renovation of the UCen because it is nearly $2 million in debt and the majority of the businesses are not successful. It also states that the interior and exterior need to be remodeled for general aesthetics “in order to have a comparative advantage over other elite universities.”</p>\n<p>The resolution also references the UCSB Long Range Development Plan 2025, which calls for an annual one percent growth of students until UCSB reaches a capacity of 25,000 students.</p>\n<p>Le created a task force to revisit the Student Union Revitalization Fund (S.U.R.F.), which had been originally created by previous A.S. president Jonathan Abboud in 2013, according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The S.U.R.F. proposal received approval from the Campus Planning Community, Vice Chancellor of Administrative Services Marc Fischer, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Michael Young, Chancellor Henry Yang and A.S. when it was first proposed in 2014.</p>\n<p>Le’s task force would assess the “internal needs” of A.S. and update the S.U.R.F. proposal. The updated plan provides 40 percent more program area than the previous concept and “[addresses] critical building infrastructure needs of the UCen.”</p>\n<p>Proposed spaces that would also be refined would include the A.S. Bike Shop, the A.S. Food Bank relocation and expansions, A.S. Senate Chambers, A.S. Recycling Center relocation, A.S. office improvements and an Environmental Sustainability Resource Center.</p>\n<p>The original resolution states that Senate stands in “full support” of Le’s project and described the project as “well-needed” and “long-overdue.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 1 issue of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Ferraro was mistakenly named as a San Miguel Hall Council Member. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 40 people marched with signs outside of the UCSB Library and the Arbor, chanting “UC, UC, you’re no good; treat your workers like you should.” The protest was held first between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and later from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday’s picket line was held to show “solidarity” with the union’s bargaining team as it works toward reaching an agreement on issues like UC overstaffing and emergency layoffs, according to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) website.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Groundskeeper lead Juan Donato has worked at UCSB for seven years and joined Thursday’s protest because it is “symbolic” of the 50th anniversary of the death of two sanitation workers, who were killed on the job after their truck’s compactor malfunctioned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We deserve, we matter and we deserve to be treated with respect and dignity,” he said. “[It’s] interesting for me 50 years of fighting and [we’re] still in the fight.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The incident prompted a strike in Memphis, which drew approximately 1,300 workers, according to the AFSCME website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workers’ deaths “inspired Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to join in marching against poor pay and unsafe working conditions,” UCSB Student Health Medical Assistant Babe Gonzales said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gonzales has worked at UCSB for 28 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is about equality, security, dignity and fairness with all UC workers. What we want is protection for women, immigrants and people of color,” she added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said the workers protesting today want wages that increase with inflation, affordable health care, secure retirement and an end to the outsourcing of jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hijinio Camacho, known around UCSB and Isla Vista as “The Elotero,” also worked at the protest by serving food alongside AFSCME workers to those who were picketing.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80758\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1038365017\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"80759\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80758\" data-attachment-id=\"80758\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/union-workers-march-in-remembrance-hold-picket-line-for-workers-rights/2016x1134-jpeg-804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed-large/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"960,540\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2016×1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80758\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=888%2C500\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016x1134.jpeg.804a4dad0f67441b85e6effd098743ed.large_.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hijinio Camacho served food alongside AFSCME during the picket line. <em>Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He recently </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/high-insurance-costs-prevent-el-elotero-from-selling-on-campus/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made the decision</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> not to hold fundraisers on UCSB’s campus because he cannot afford the high insurance costs required of campus vendors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We represent cooks, custodians, groundskeepers, so we’re right now trying to send a message to management saying that this is about equality, this is about fairness,” AFSCME organizer Mercedes Ramirez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We want [the UC] to treat them right, and that’s why we have to do this,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Kile, a fifth-year chemistry major and AFSCME intern, explained that he joined the protest today because of his father, who passed away from pancreatic cancer before Kile started his senior year of high school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explained that his father worked two jobs, one at U.P.S. and one working full time at California Lutheran University. His mom also worked full time as a teacher while she finished attending school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I was 17, he was feeling sick and he didn’t want to stop working so he kept working, kept working, and he finally went to go get checked and it turned out he had pancreatic cancer, stage four,” Kile said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He wouldn’t have had to deal with that if this country can get the concept together that a single job, 40 hours a week, should be enough to provide for you and your family. Many of our workers are working through full-time jobs. If they end up with the same thing then there’s gonna be someone else like me who loses a parent,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he has had to drop out of school and has “literally lost weight from not being able to eat.” He has also been homeless during parts of his time at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kile said that over the past 40 years, unions have been in a “sharp decline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Everyone from Democrats to Republicans have been attacking unions for a very, very long time,” he said. “I mean, Hillary Clinton was on the board of Walmart, which was one of the biggest union busters, Elon Musk is a union buster, Jeff Bezos from Amazon hates unions and the working conditions they produce are horrific.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also referenced the wage gap between men and women, explaining that the average pay from women to men is 78 cents an hour, but for Latinx women it is approximately 55 cents an hour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Where do you fix that, where do you fix those inequalities across race, gender, sexuality and everything?

Senator Kian Maalizadeh authored the resolution to provide funding for students unable to travel home because of financial issues. <em>Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kian Maalizadeh, transfer senator and fourth-year biology major, created the resolution on Dec. 8. Ilene Ochoa, an off-campus senator and fourth-year communication major, seconded the resolution, which was later passed through an email vote on Dec. 10.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email votes are usually used only in emergency situations, Maalizadeh said. Senators used an email vote because the fire grew quickly after their last planned meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the resolution, the Senate will take $5,000 from their unallocated fund which is made up of student fees, and a detailed list of what was purchased will be sent back to Associated Students (A.S.). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh said the resolution was made intentionally vague because he anticipates that many  unforeseen problems could arise during the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he created the resolution because he wanted to show A.S.’s support for the students affected by the fire.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of students were calling UC admin saying they couldn’t leave, they couldn’t afford to leave; they were stuck, basically in the pollution,” Maalizadeh said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said A.S. released polls asking students if they needed aid to get off campus, and the overall response was “yes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deadline to request funds was 10:30 a.m. on Dec. 14 so that the Financial Crisis Response Team could process checks in a “timely manner,” according to Maalizadeh. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.S. Senators posted on Facebook about the resolution and told students to email A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez by the deadline if they needed transportation funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Márquez forwarded the students’ full names and student identification numbers to the university’s Financial Crisis Response Team, which then decided how much money a student would be awarded for transportation on a case-by-case basis, Maalizadeh said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of the $5,000 that was allocated, $2,800 was used as of Dec. 14, according to Michael Miller, assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who responded by the 10:30 a.m. Thursday deadline were able to pick up checks at 3 p.m. from the BARC office, Miller said. Students who responded after that deadline but before 10:30 a.m. Friday can pick up their checks by 3 p.m. today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miller said the amount of money given to students depended on their destination and was based off the cost of a Amtrak ticket. He explained that a student who needed to travel south to Los Angeles or San Diego was given approximately $40.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who needed to travel north to San Francisco or Sacramento were given approximately $100 for the fare, Miller said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approximately 50 students received funding, according to Brooke Kopel, a college of letters and sciences senator and third-year political science major.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thomas Fire has burned 252,500 acres and is 35 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mandatory evacuations have occurred across Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and 972 structures have been destroyed.
