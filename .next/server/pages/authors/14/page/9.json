Users can also report problems with the bicycle through the app.</p>\n<p>The first official steps toward bringing a bicycle sharing program to campus first began three years ago, said Mo Lovegreen, UCSB’s campus sustainability director.</p>\n<p>“A board was formed that included UCSB, the County of Santa Barbara, the City of Santa Barbara, the Santa Barbara Waterfront, SBCC, SBCAG, MTD, the Santa Barbara Bicycle Coalition [and] the City of Goleta,” Lovegreen said in an email.</p>\n<p>The group agreed UCSB should take the lead on the program, include Isla Vista and then expand into the cities of Goleta and Santa Barbara down the road, according to Wagner.</p>\n<p>UCSB then received proposals from eight bicycle-sharing companies looking to set up in the area, Lovegreen said.</p>\n<p>“A.S. Bikes and a number of students on campus participated in developing the scoring rubric for the proposals as well as the bikes, they also test-rode the bikes, and were part of the decision making body for the vendor,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>HOPR’s “no cost” offer was what ultimately sealed the deal. The company said it would shoulder the full cost of the program, which would have otherwise costed the university around $1.5 million dollars for the initial start-up.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84080\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84080\" data-attachment-id=\"84080\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/hopping-into-the-new-school-year-hopr-bike-share-has-arrived/hopr-app/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,2048\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"hopr app\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84080\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=888%2C888\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"888\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1472%2C1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=1104%2C1104&amp;ssl=1 1104w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=912%2C912&amp;ssl=1 912w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?resize=470%2C470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hopr-app.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84080\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Users can locate bicycles and their “pods” on the HOPR app. <em>Courtesy of HOPR app</em></p></div>\n<p>HOPR signed a three-year-long contract in early May 2019, according to Callie Price, UCSB’s purchasing and contracts manager. The contract can be extended before it expires.</p>\n<p>Each bike normally costs somewhere between $1,500 and $5,000, Wagner said.</p>\n<p>“For dock bikes, there are dock costs, and then there’s transaction fees for the credit cards and maintenance and all sorts of things,” Wagner said.</p>\n<p>The first 1,000 students who sign for the annual membership with their UCSB email – and also qualify for financial aid through UCSB – will receive half the membership money back into their Billing Accounts Receivable Collection (BARC).</p>\n<p>The bicycle sharing program is also an added bonus to a campus where over 1,500 bicycles are abandoned every year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a waste problem in terms of abandoned bikes,” Wagner said. “We do sell some of them; the CSOs do a sale at the third week of every quarter in order to put some of those bikes back into service, but usually they only sell a 150 back to the students.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe, as people use more and more bike share bikes, there will be fewer bikes abandoned.”</p>\n<p>HOPR plans to add more than 900 additional bicycles to the UCSB and I.V. area by January 2019, according to Wagner. Eventually, “upgraded” bicycles, such those with electric pedals, will be integrated into the campus.</p>\n<p>“A lot of our students ride bikes at night without any lights or reflectors, or anything else. The HOPR bikes all have front rear lights that activate whenever you ride,” Wagner said.</p>\n<p>“Students are riding HOPR bikes that are well-lit, brand new and are frequently maintained and inspected. Hopefully that will keep everyone who rides them safer.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

<p>Police arrested a 20-year-old for cocaine possession, among other charges, in Isla Vista Saturday morning, during which a deputy “pulled out his service weapon,” according to police.</p>\n<p>The individual, Kole Yamashiro, was removed from his vehicle around 7:15 a.m. after deputies from the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) observed said vehicle blocking a driveway on the 6600 block of Abrego Road.</p>\n<p>After approaching, deputies removed Yamashiro from the car and called medical officials for an unresponsive female companion who appeared to be suffering from an opioid overdose, according to Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson.</p>\n<p>Both were determined to be under the influence of a controlled substance, while Yamashiro was found in possession of cocaine and Xanax.</p>\n<p>A deputy then pulled his service weapon when Yamashiro “did not comply with the deputy’s commands regarding reaching into his pocket,” Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Manuel, a 22-year-old I.V. resident who asked that his last name not be used, initially posted on Facebook after he witnessed the incident.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Nexus, he said the police had been called because the vehicle was blocking the entrance to his driveway.</p>\n<p>Manuel said he saw no sign of resistance during Yamashiro’s arrest and that the officer had taken “aggressive action.”</p>\n<p>According to Manuel, a police officer “pull[ed] out his gun” and “threatened to shoot [Yamashiro] while he was on the ground.”</p>\n<p>“The male was not armed, was clearly confused to what was happening because he was woken up by the cops,” Manuel said.</p>\n<p>The female, who Manuel said had woken up after police arrested Yamashiro, was shouting that it was Yamashiro’s fault they were locked out of their apartment and subsequently had to sleep in their car, according to Manuel.</p>\n<p>Yamashiro, who is on probation, was officially charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale, being under the influence of a controlled substance and possession of a narcotic.</p>\n<p>He was cited and released approximately 11 hours after the incident.</p>\n<p>It is unknown if Yamashiro is an Isla Vista or Goleta resident because the address provided on Yamashiro’s arrest log does not exist.</p>\n<p>Yamashiro initially enrolled at Santa Barbara City College in Fall 2016, but later withdrew later that quarter. He re-enrolled in Spring 2017, but again dropped his classes.</p>\n<p>Hoover said SBSO does not release body camera footage of an incident for an incident that is currently under investigation, in accordance with Government Code 6254(f).</p>\n<p><i>Updated [Aug. 24]: This article was updated to include Hoover’s statement regarding body camera footage. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Judge Donna D. Geck ruled the UC Regents failed to provide a fair hearing for the accused student, known in court documents as John Doe, in a Title IX investigation. UCSB expelled Doe in November 2016 after a student filed a Title IX complaint against him that June.</p>\n<p>The student who filed the complaint, referred to as Jane Roe in court documents, said Doe stalked her on a daily basis after the two engaged in a sexual encounter in November 2015 and briefly dated.</p>\n<p>UCSB Title IX investigator Brian Quillen determined the stalking offense, among others, “more likely than not did occur,” according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Following his expulsion, Doe attempted twice to appeal the decision: once with the Interpersonal Violence Appeal Review Committee (IPVARC) at UCSB in December 2016 and then again with the California Superior Court in December 2017, contending that the initial investigation had not been fair.</p>\n<p>While the IPVARC did not find issues with the procedures of the Title IX case, Geck found issues with the IPVARC’s review. Namely, she agreed with Doe’s argument that UCSB’s internal policies were “Confusing, Internally Inconsistent, and Unfair,” and she lifted his expulsion and ordered his case be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>The IPVARC panel reconvened in February 2018 and mirrored its original decision, once again expelling Doe.</p>\n<p>Doe returned to court in June to contend that his case had not been seriously reconsidered by the IPVARC, citing the language of the original and new decision to show they were almost exactly the same, minus one introductory sentence in the latter to address the court’s complaint.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Geck ruled the new decision was “merely a poorly rewritten decision that appears to be a justification for the earlier result,” finding UCSB in contempt of the court and annulling the panel’s decision.</p>\n<p>Doe now has the option to return to the UC system beginning Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Prior to filing the Title IX complaint, Roe filed a harassment report with the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) in May 2016. After the SBSO investigation determined there was no evidence of Doe’s alleged misconduct, she then filed the Title IX complaint.</p>\n<p>Roe stated Doe, following the initial encounter, had:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>followed her “to and from her classes for nearly an entire academic year on a daily basis”;</li>\n<li>“had an unidentified third-party call Roe three times… threatened to kill her, rape her”;</li>\n<li>“waited outside of Roe’s apartment building for her”;</li>\n<li>and “deliberately maintained close proximity to Jane Roe and her boyfriend and engaged in conduct directed at her and her boyfriend” while at a sorority event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, Roe alleged she said “no” multiple times during the November 2015 encounter, while Doe stated Roe provided “affirmative consent” throughout.</p>\n<p>Doe cited text messages sent between Doe’s former roommate and Roe to prove to the court that the encounter had been consensual. One of the text messages, sent by Roe the night of the Nov. encounter, read: “The truth is, if I had been waxed and more prepared, it would have gone further.”</p>\n<p>Roe later stated these messages were sent in an attempt to cope with the alleged assault.</p>\n<p>In his statement to the court, Doe denied Roe’s allegations and alleged that she had aggressively pursued him after their initial sexual encounter in Nov., offering anecdotal evidence to demonstrate he had initially been reluctant to enter into a relationship with her.</p>\n<p>He alleged Roe, following the initial encounter, had:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“started frequently appearing in Doe’s room unannounced and uninvited”;</li>\n<li>“frequently stayed in the lounge of [his] residence hall, in his room, or outside his door for long periods of time” to the extent that he “no longer felt safe in his residence hall”;</li>\n<li>would “come to John Doe’s residence hall to party and drink alcohol”;</li>\n<li>“put up posters around John Doe’s residence hall and all over campus containing a diatribe against her alleged ‘sexual offender,’ with the objective of intimidating and harassing [him].”;</li>\n<li>and told him she would “file a restraining order against him” if he did not agree to meet with a mediator of her choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doe initially made a formal complaint to UCSB about the “harassment and stalking” by Jane Roe in December 2015. Doe said he left the school temporarily before the quarter ended to “escape the stressful situation,” alleging his grades suffered due to Roe’s harassment.</p>\n<p>Once he returned to UCSB, he requested a room change and was then allowed to move out of his residence hall.</p>\n<p>However, Doe argued in his court case that none of his allegations were taken seriously by Title IX investigator Quillen. Instead, he argued Quillen was biased in the investigation and failed to provide him with the resources he was entitled to in order to defend himself adequately.</p>\n<p>The University of California Office of the President is considering <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/title-ix/\">potential amendments</a> to its system-wide policy following a federal investigation that revealed UC Berkeley violated Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>If approved, several changes would aim to address concerns similar to those brought up by Doe in his case.</p>\n<p>The amendments would include clarifying the types of evidence to be included in an investigation, outlining the contents of a formal notice of charges, providing students with the option to question the other party through the investigator and mandating consistent training for the appeal board.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

I had transferred schools four times before then, and my middle school best friend had transferred to another school district. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then this curly-haired, brown-eyed girl sat next to me in my second period Spanish class, and the only reality I had ever known flew out the fucking window. </span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took me seven months to realize I was in love with her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I came out to my parents three hours after that life-shattering realization. To my then-love, a year later. Most of my friends, 11 months after that. Slowly, one after another, the people in my life began to learn that I, Evelyn Spence, was attracted to women – even while I was still struggling to learn exactly what that meant. Bisexual? Pansexual? Queer? Lesbian? </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s lovely, it’s terrifying, but more than anything, coming out is gathering that courage deep within yourself to announce to the world: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been four years, and I have slowly become comfortable with the blue, purple and pink that accompany the bisexual label. I have the bi colors in hearts in my Twitter bio, a rainbow emoji next to my name on Instagram and a photo of me sprawled out under a giant ass-inflatable rainbow as my Facebook profile photo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But here’s the thing: I am 19 years old now, and I am Still. Coming. Out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I come out every day: When I walk down the street with my bi-flag sweatshirt on and meet eyes with the stranger crossing the street, I come out. When I call my crush “babe” in front of the Starbucks barista, I come out. When I hold hands with a girl at the mall near my house, when I make gay jokes to those I’ve just met and when I clip my fifth queer pin to my backpack, I come out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming out is a jumble of emotions and tears and laughter and brings on more awkward conversations than I ever thought were possible. I have come out to many people in my 19 years, but there are still those who remain unaware of my rampant queerness, such as my grandmother, who will finally know after she reads this article, and the coming out will begin again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s lovely, it’s terrifying, but more than anything, coming out is gathering that courage deep within yourself to announce to the world: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s a huge difference between 15 and 19 – now, students of UCSB and beyond, I am proud to announce that I am no longer afraid of coming out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Posting queer and bi posts on my Instagram and Twitter no longer bring out that uneasiness in the pit of my stomach. I no longer cover up my gay and bi shirts with black leather jackets; I send my father pictures of myself in front of rainbow flags; I scream “GAY!” in the street every time I see something remotely rainbow related. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(I very recently visited the Castro District in San Francisco. I’m sure you can all guess how that went.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am no longer nervous to tell the world who I am, and that is the point I am trying to make in this article. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those still in the closet, to those with one foot in and one foot out, to those who are terrified to even to be associated with the rainbow, let me tell you that one day, you will be able to let go of that breath you are holding – and yes, I stole that partly from “Love, Simon,” but the point remains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish I could’ve said that to my 15-year-old self.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have found a home in people who make me happy, who jokingly roll their eyes at my gay jokes and who will support me for the rest of my life, regardless of whom I choose to marry.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This piece is a summary of my coming out, but this is also an open letter to all of you who are afraid; this is a letter to those of you who are scared to hold your love’s hand in the street and to those of you who cannot tell your parents who you are. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know that I am speaking from a place of privilege. I was lucky enough to be born to a mother who knew I was queer two years before I did and a father who still loves me, even though I know he will never be at peace with what he believes is a “made-up” sexuality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To my parents, I say that in my 19 years I have met people who place themselves on all levels of the Kinsey scale. Nothing in life ever fits into a neat little box, so why should sexuality be the one that does? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But let me tell you – if you do not have a support system at home, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you will find one</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I have found a family with friends who celebrate my queerness. I have found a home in people who make me happy, who jokingly roll their eyes at my gay jokes and who will support me for the rest of my life, regardless of whom I choose to marry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find those people. Even when it gets hard, even when you can’t breathe anymore, even when it feels like your life has become tragedy incarnate. It may take a while – it took me four years – but happiness is worth waiting for because one day, you will no longer be afraid of coming out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I pinky promise. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evelyn Spence wants people to know that she is a HUGE fan of the rainbow emoji.

Elections Board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> the then EVPSA-elect, Mayela Morales, in May.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-22/breaking-special-election-for-evpsa-will-be-held-fall-quarter/\">special election</a> for the EVPSA position will be held during Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>Carlton-Carew and Briseno listed several reasons in the resolution as to why the funds would be allocated this way, noting that a large portion of the EVPSA’s job begins during the summer rather than during Fall Quarter 2018.</p>\n<p>“The EVPSA must attend all UCSA and UC Regents meetings as funds permit,” the resolution states. “The EVPSA manages all forms of media as it relates to the EVPSA office… as well as the official EVPSA email which is used for all state, national, and UC wide connections.”</p>\n<p>The resolution further states that two conferences, the UC Student Organizing Summit (UCSOS) and the United States Student Association (USSA) Congress, will take place over the summer.</p>\n<p>“Failing to send delegations to these conferences will result in the lack of representation of the UCSB student community,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>“The UCSB student community deserves to continue being allowed to participate in<br>\nthese events since they often serve as the initial point for students to get involved in the bettering<br>\nof student affairs on- and off-campus.”</p>\n<p>The passing of the vote grants temporary access to the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) funds to the following individuals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) – Jeike Meijer</li>\n<li>Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) – Grecia Martinez</li>\n<li>Associated Students (A.S.) President – Brooke Kopel</li>\n<li>A.S. President Proxy – not named in the resolution</li>\n<li>Lobby Corps Co-Chairs – not named in the resolution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>EVPLA Meijer, the president’s proxy and the Lobby Corps Co-chairs will serve as A.S. representatives throughout the University of California Student Association (UCSA) board meetings.</p>\n<p>S.A.G. Martinez will serve as the A.S. representation during the USSA board meetings.</p>\n<p>President Kopel will “contribute toward logistical work needed” to plan UCSOS with EVPLA Meijer and Lobby Corps Co-chairs.</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President (I.V.P.) Steven Ho will assign a director of accountability to oversee the above-mentioned individuals.</p>\n<p>All involved will submit bi-weekly reports to the director, who is not yet assigned, according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The individuals listed above will be “compensated for their work through the senate’s unallocated funds” and their duties will be dissolved “the date that the new EVPSA is sworn-in,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>All will be paid the equivalent of a BCU chair, according to the resolution.</p>\n<p>The exact amount of funds the EVPSA office manages was not listed in the resolution.</p>\n<p><em>Update: This article was updated to include Carlton-Carew’s quote. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The measure will impose an <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/future-of-i-v-government-in-voters-hands/\">eight percent user utility tax</a> on electricity, garbage disposal, gas, sewage and water services. It will produce a net total of approximately $740,000 per year, according to Spencer Brandt, I.V. Community Service District (CSD) board secretary.</p>\n<p>This was the CSD’s second attempt to secure consistent funding following the failure of <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/no-on-f-leaves-csd-fundless/\">Measure F</a> in 2016, which left the CSD without a primary source of funding.</p>\n<p>The “Yes on Measure R 2018” campaign – spearheaded by Brandt, CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud, CSD President Ethan Bertrand and UC Santa Barbara Campus Democrats outgoing President Emily Murray – has been promoting the measure since the end of UCSB’s Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>“Throughout this whole process, we’ve organized a group of passionate community volunteers to speak with residents about the issues that matter to them,” Bertrand said. “We knocked on every door in Isla Vista at least three times, some doors we hit up to six times.”</p>\n<p>Most I.V. residents will pay the tax, but Brandt said the CSD is currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>Across the 10 precincts, 638 I.V. residents voted yes on the measure while 133 residents voted no, according to Santa Barbara County semi-official election night results: 82.75 percent vs. 17.25 percent.</p>\n<p>Approximately 23,000 people live in I.V. as of the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/islavistacdpcalifornia/PST045217#qf-flag-X\">most recently conducted</a> census in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\n<p>Initial results from the Vote By Mail and Mailed Ballot Results reported 56.34 percent yes votes and 43.66 percent no votes on the measure.</p>\n<p>However, these numbers jumped to 71.04 percent yes votes and 23.64 percent no votes once votes from the first precincts came in. The percentage of yes votes rose throughout the night from there, while the percentage of no votes steadily decreased.</p>\n<p>“We were sort of cautiously optimistic, but when that first polling station came in, and we were up, that was just insane,” Brandt said. “I don’t think any of us believed it…I was crying, I think a lot of us were.”</p>\n<p>Murray, a second-year history and public policy major, shared Brandt’s sentiments.</p>\n<p>“I walked up to Rincon, and Spencer ran out and said, ‘We did it!’” Murray said. “I was overjoyed…when we found out we won by a lot, that was amazing.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_83520\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-83520\" data-attachment-id=\"83520\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/measure-r-passes-yes-on-measure-r-campaign-celebrates/cs8a9610/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=2048%2C1582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"measure R party\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?fit=888%2C686&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-83520\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=888%2C686\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=250%2C193&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?resize=1024%2C791&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS8A9610.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-83520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is the CSD’s second attempt to secure funding. <em>Angie Banks / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Throughout the course of the campaign, the pro-Measure R group <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/how-much-are-pro-anti-measure-r-groups-spending-for-your-vote/\">raised</a> $35,630.25 and spent $7,107.67 as of May 19, according to <a href=\"https://www.southtechhosting.com/SantaBarbaraCounty/CampaignDocsWebRetrieval/Search/SearchByFilerName.aspx\">campaign filings</a> with the Santa Barbara County.

Community Resource Building, Brandt said.</p>\n<p>“I’m just elated and so excited for the good work that we can do for the people of Isla Vista, from opening the community center to improving public safety to continuing to work on tenant-landlord issues,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p><em>Sofia Mejias contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

During the investigation, Martinez’s charges were listed among the search results. The <em>Nexus </em>then obtained police arrest records for the charges in question.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) officers first arrested Martinez on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive in Isla Vista at approximately 11:40 a.m. on Feb. 14, according to arrest records. Martinez was charged with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.</p>\n<p>She was booked in the Santa Barbara Jail on $25,000 bail and was released around 1 a.m. on Feb. 15, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>Martinez pleaded not guilty. A settlement conference will be held in September, according to Santa Barbara trial court records. Martinez is being tried as a defendant against the People of the State of California.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.occourts.org/self-help/restrainingorders/criminalrestrainingorders.html\">criminal protective order</a>, which requires a “restrained person” not to “hurt, threaten, or communicate with the other person,” was filed on March 14, according to court records.</p>\n<p>In a separate incident, California Highway Patrol (CHP) stopped Martinez on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive in I.V. on March 1 at approximately 1:50 a.m. on charges of driving under the influence with a blood alcohol percent of over 0.08 percent, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>Martinez is also being charged with possession of a controlled substance, according to court records. The charge is not present in the arrest records, however.</p>\n<p>She was cited with a $5,000 bail and was released from the Santa Barbara Jail around 11:20 p.m. later that day, according to arrest records.</p>\n<p>An arraignment will be held for the DUI charges on June 26, according to court records.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/live-a-s-election-results-2018/\">Martinez was elected</a> in late April and officially sworn in as Student Advocate General (S.A.G.) last Thursday. The S.A.G. works within the Office of Student Advocate, which works to help students who “face charges from the University in housing, academic, social conduct, and public interest matters,” according to the OSA website.</p>\n<p>Martinez also served as a letters and science senator on the A.S.

The minutes explained the board’s decision to hold a special election during Fall Quarter 2018 for the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA) position.</p>\n<p>The board <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-16/breaking-evpsa-elect-disqualified-from-a-s-public-office/\">disqualified</a> EVPSA-elect Mayela Morales last week.

Renteria said voting for the special election will begin on Oct. 15 at 8 a.m. and will close on Oc. 18. The board will announce the results the same night.</p>\n<p>All candidates who ran in the spring election will be eligible to run for the position of EVPSA in the fall election, Renteria said. However, candidates must run independently rather than with a political party.</p>\n<p>The meeting was adjourned before the senators could accept the board’s minutes.</p>\n<p>“My senate is not cooperating with me,” Ho said after the senators failed to approve the Elections Board minutes for the second time.</p>\n<p>The Senate’s approval of the minutes, however, is a formality, so Election Board’s decision to disqualify Morales remains legitimate.</p>\n<p>The meeting ended just after 5:30 p.m. with more than a quarter of the agenda left unaddressed because another group needed the State Street Room for a meeting.</p>\n<p><em>Simren Verma contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
