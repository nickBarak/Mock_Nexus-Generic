He previously lost twice in A.S. elections – once as an External Vice President for Local Affairs candidate in 2016-2017 and again in the 2017-2018 presidential race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 32.34% of the undergraduate student body voted in this year’s election, compared to 39.7% of last year. According to the A.S.

I am excited to do a lot of good work and [make] tangible change.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race between External Vice President for Local Affairs (EVPLA) candidates Christian Ornelas and Matthew Griffin came the closest. With 3,012 votes, Ornelas narrowly defeated Griffin, who earned 2,915, by a margin of 97 votes – a mere 1.6%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to A.S. Legal Code, “A recount shall be given whenever the difference between the Candidates is two percent (2%) or less of the votes cast for the office; or whenever evidence of an erroneous count is shown and called to the attention of the Elections Board Chairperson or the Senate within one (1) week (seven (7) days) after the vote has been announced.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elections Board did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding a potential recount. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know that I have really big shoes to fill, so I’m excited to start working with Jeike, start having our transition meetings, just to really make sure that I can live up to all the work that she’s done because she’s done a lot for this campus,” Ornelas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Vice President-elect Alli Adam ran unopposed after her would-be opponent, Yash Nagpal, </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/isla-vista-party-will-not-run-internal-vice-president-candidate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dropped out of the race</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during Week 1 of Spring Quarter, citing health concerns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Associated Students has a bright future for 2019-2020, and that’s all I have to say,” Adam, a third-year political science major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrew Nguyen was also unopposed in his race for Student Advocate General. Nguyen ran for an off-campus Senate seat with Campus United during the 2017-2018 school year and served on the 69th Senate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campus United External Vice President for Statewide Affairs-elect Daevionne Beasley defeated Isla Vista Party candidate Alexandra Leal Silva by a margin of 513 votes. Beasley, a second-year sociology major, emphasized that he wants to continue working with Leal Silva during his EVPSA term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m most excited to reach out to [Leal Silva] and see exactly what ideas she has from working in the EVPSA office these last three years … I know that she was so instrumental in keeping the office going when there was no EVPSA, I really need her input and insight,” Beasley said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We reached out to each other before and we said that no matter the results, we’d work with each other and I hope that continues and that the sentiment was real, and I can’t wait to see where both of our ideas will take us forward.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All fee reaffirmations passed, and the sole new fee on the ballot – a fee for the Student Initiated Recruitment and Retention Committee (SIRRC) – also passed with 64.93% of the vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with most A.S. elections, the days leading up to the final results were filled with contentious jabs between the two parties, but it was the day of elections when A.S.

Austin Foreman, a first-year pre-biology major and Emma Swanson, a first-year physics major, are running with Campus United. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diaz and Swanson did not attend the forum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The questions asked by Elections Board and answered by the candidates are below: </span></p>\n<p><b>What would your first priority be if elected? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said his first priority would be to implement a committee that would create a digital library of textbooks so students wouldn’t have to purchase textbooks every quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she would make sure Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) has more “initiative to reduce the waitlist times.” </span></p>\n<p><b>How will the two-party system with campaigning affect the way you take office? Will you be able to work effectively with members of the other party? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said polarization is a “huge issue” in the Senate, and said it’s important to be bipartisan and make sure senators are “reaching the needs of the student body instead of being focused on just our parties.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said this will not be an issue. He said he would work to fulfill students’ needs regardless of party lines. </span></p>\n<p><b>For someone who is unfamiliar with the way A.S. works and what an on-campus senator does, could you explain what you do and what do you plan to do once you take office?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman explained that students each pay approximately $600 toward A.S., which makes up a total budget of about $14 million. He said he is looking to use the money toward fixing the bike paths and implementing a system to maintain the paths, as well as increasing funding for mental health resources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas echoed Foreman’s explanation of what A.S. is, adding that senators write bills and resolutions that focus on helping students’ needs. She said she would love to work on implementing workshops in all the dorm halls that would address financial aid, mental health, anti-blackness and “anything to the needs of the students that I think would really help them branch out and understand how to navigate college life.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of the times first years or even fourth years people can struggle with the stress of college life or guilt for not being there to pay and provide for their families. But I think it’s really important that if this happens or if a student is struggling, that they are referred to a program or know about the resources they have here at UCSB.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Serving on the Senate is an extremely large time commitment. Just last week Senate had a meeting that ran for over 10 hours. Senators are expected to be present at various BCU meetings and have several other responsibilities as well. If you are elected, do you believe you will be able to dedicate yourself to the position and the time commitment that is needed? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she will dedicate her time and effort to the Senate, as well as the Boards Commissions &amp; Units (BCU) meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m the type of leader who doesn’t overpower voices. I’m the type of leader who would love to sit down with a person and talk and hear their needs and the responsibilities they believe the A.S. Senate should have. In order to implement that, that requires time and effort… I want others to tell me what they need from me and work and collaborate with them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he will be able to fulfill the time commitment required, stating he is very “time management oriented.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I also look forward to sitting on Senate regardless of the length of the meeting and following and learning the procedures of Senate… I love to liason for meetings and learn about all the different organizations on our campus and the diversity and what they wish to see in Senate.” </span></p>\n<p><b>This past year, the price to live in a double room with a 14 meal plan increased by approximately $500 dollars. What will you do to address increasing costs and make living in the dorms more affordable for on-campus students? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he believes financial security is a “very important issue that is pressing our students at the moment.” He admitted that he is “not very educated on the cost of dorm living and the meal plan increase” but said he hopes to be educated on that once he takes his Senate seat. He repeated his plan to implement the open-source textbook program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said the rising cost of tuition is a “really prevalent problem.” To address this, she said meals swipes should be transferable and shared among students. </span></p>\n<p><b>Reports of on-campus sexual assault and dating violence have been on the rise during recent years. What would you do to address sexual violence on campus, and most importantly, how would you support and advocate for survivors?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she would like to implement a faster emergency response system, so when students are walking from the library to Isla Vista, or from Isla Vista to the dorms, there is an “earlier response to their needs.” She added that she would like to implement a policy that would enforce harsher punishment on assaulters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said that he, along with other Campus United candidates, want to implement a Blue Light system in I.V. He added that there should be an office on campus that survivors can go to and speak to someone about what happened to them, and report on the issue “so that it can be addressed and that the assaulter be reprimanded and [so] that it does not happen again.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any leadership or work experience relating to UCSB Housing and Dining? For example, experience with RHA, or a job in the dorms, or the dining commons. If you do, how would you use your past experience to help you in your new position. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreman said he is the Queer-Trans Student engagement chair in the Santa Catalina South Hall council. In that position, he works to “create space spaces where people, regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, and all factors can come and enjoy themselves and express themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would take this experience and bring that to Senate and make it a place where diversity is welcomed and can thrive,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rojas said she does not have an experience with UCSB housing or dining, but said she has experience as an intern for CalPerg and worked on the affordable textbooks campaign. She added that she has experience in Hermanas Unidas. </span></p>\n<p>Profiles of all 50 A.S. candidates can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/interactives/aselections2019/\">here</a>.

He also noted that the general student body “isn’t necessarily up to par” on what the organization does and where student fees go, so he wants to change that and make sure students voices are “head at a state-wide and national level.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has been working within the EVPSA office since her first year at UCSB – first as an EVPSA fellow, then as a community organizing director, and then as the legislative director – and now feels that she now has enough experience to run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We as students are the future of the state, of this county, and we deserve to have a space in these vocations and be able to speak to what it is you need in order to be successful, what our students need in order to be successful.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Do you have any experience organizing UCSB students at the statewide level, such as lobby, or with UC wide-work? What have your experiences shown you about some of the issues facing students today? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she has had a lot of experience lobbying for students, again referencing her past three years in the EVPSA office. She further noted that she is a member of Lobby Corps, and has been organizing student trips to the U.S. Senate, the legislator and Capitol Hill through this entire past year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They need to hear where they’re at because they are living in this bubble, this congressional bubble. I’m going to be able to pop that and say, ‘hey, we are your students. We are who elected you and you need to be able to listen to us and take our student concerns into value.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley referenced his work on </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-03-14/summer-cal-grant-bill-reintroduced/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Bill 3153</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a bill to extend the Cal Grant into summer sessions, stating that he and other students would “drive up to Sacramento at ungodly hours to testify at these hearings and train different students on what they’re testifying on behalf of UC.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve really seen the beauty and power that comes with organizing students. I absolutely love it and I appreciate every moment of getting to help students fight for the fight.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Can you name some of the communities on the UCSB campus that you believe are the most marginalized? As the new EVPSA, how would you attempt to amplify these voices that you have mentioned and how do you ensure that students of all backgrounds are represented?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said Black students are the most marginalized community at UCSB, making up 4% of the campus. He said Black students don’t get the same institutional support that other groups may have, and said that either he or someone on his staff would be in attendance at Black Student Union (BSU) board meetings. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said that while he cannot speak to the experiences of other marginalized students on campus, he would make sure to compose his office of people from different backgrounds as to increase representation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When it comes to legislation… on the floor right now, to reaffirm the standards for deadly force for police officers and UCPD and California as a whole, we really need Black students to advocate on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the community.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said she wants to listen to all voices on campus, and would take those concerns to the “state, to the federal government, to the Regents because [everyone’s] experiences matter.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The EVPSA is a servant to its community. It’s time to take that to the next level and I’m ready to serve my students at any capacity.” </span></p>\n<p><b>In the past year, have you had any direct involvement with the EVPSA office, and whether you have or not, what would you change about the office?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva repeated that fact that she has been in the office these past three years, noting the hardships that came with not having an EVPSA this past year. She added that her work as a Resident Assistant and as a UCSB tour guide gives her a “unique perspective” and further knowledge as to how to serve students best. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley also referenced the lack of an EVPSA during this past year, stating that “put students in a very hard position.” He added that the lack of someone in that position forced students into “non-institutional routes” to try and make change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said he worked with 2017-2018 EVPSA Kristin Hsu during his first year, going on lobby trips and advocating for extending the Cal Grant. </span></p>\n<p><b>Thanks to the amazing work from UCSB’s voter registration volunteer coalition, UCSB has set national records on voter registration and voter turnout. How would you work with UCSB’s student-run voter registration coalition to increase voter turnout even further into 2020? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said it’s “absolutely incredible” that UCSB has one of the highest registered voters out of any campus in the nation. He said that while civic engagement is already very important to UCSB students, that would be expanded to work with more organizations on campus by tabling and registering people to vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I know you might feel a little bit discouraged with the political climate right now, and it’s very easy to think that, ‘oh, national or any type of election doesn’t matter [because] our voices aren’t heard.’ But I’m here to say… that is not true. Each and every single voice counts.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced the UC coordinator position within the office,  who “works tirelessly throughout the year to reinvigorate the [registration volunteer coalition program].” She added onto Beasley’s point by stating that she will expand that role, while also working to include the voices of students who don’t have the ability to vote. </span></p>\n<p><b>How do you plan on getting students interested in attending EVPSA functions such as Regents meetings?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said that accessibility has been an issue not just within the EVPSA office, but within A.S. overall. She said she would work to be as “transparent as possible.” She also noted that the office should table toward the beginning of the year in order to gauge issues that students care about, and then set up a system that would alert them when the office is doing work on an issue they care about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The work that these students are doing is fueled by passion and grit and the will to serve, and we need to be able to highlight that and show students, ‘these are what your students are doing. This is why they care. This is how you can get involved.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said his work as a Resident Assistant allowed him to see that marketing is the key to making sure students attend events. He said he wouldn’t let students know about events through “a robotic way, like through email.” </span></p>\n<p><b>Considering the budget restraints nationwide, what specific portion of the budget and Higher Education Act would you advocate for? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said specific numbers cannot be counted until it is known how much tax revenue California has. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The nation as a whole needs to prioritize education, needs to put that at the forefront, because education builds the leaders for tomorrow… Education is a right and people need to be educated on the issues that they’re fighting for.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva referenced California Governor Gavin Newsoms’ budget that was </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/no-pic-newsom-allocates-400-million-to-uc-system-aiming-to-increase-student-success/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">released earlier this year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She noted that while his goal for the UC system to intake more students is “fabulous,” it is ultimately hard to accommodate more students because “we can barely accommodate the ones we have.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we’re talking about budget asks, what we’re advocating for, we need to be looking at things like basic needs. We need to be looking at things and making sure we’re funding our resources. We need to be looking at things like deferred maintenance – we have buildings falling apart, we have elevators that you wouldn’t dare step in because you value your life.” </span></p>\n<p><b>What would be the very first issue you will tackle if you are elected as EVPSA? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal Silva said the first thing she would tackle is financial aid expansion. She added that she wants to bring back the pell grant and wants to look into expanding the middle class scholarship. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Without financial aid, I wouldn’t even be standing up here. You want to talk about subsidized housing, food stamps? That is me. Still will probably be me for a while, but it’s because of financial aid that I’m able to attend this university.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beasley said he wants to make sure that marginalized students’ voices are “uplifted and heard.” He said that, if elected, he would “bring these people that are often put at the bottom of the social hierarchy and make sure they’re brought to the top.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We can’t have one person of color or one marginalized student there and expect them to advocate on behalf of everyone that’s not present.

A speaker has not yet been announced. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the second time in recent years that the union has called for a boycott of commencement speakers. During Spring Quarter 2018, United States Senator and current presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Congressman John Lewis withdrew from speaking at UC Berkeley and UC San Diego respectively after AFSCME called for a boycott amidst contract negotiations, the press release states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The union and the university have been negotiating over contracts for over two years.

This left Campus United candidate Alli Adam as the sole candidate in the race.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the drop, the Isla Vista Party tried to submit a substitute candidate, Off-Campus Senator Jasmine Palmerin, in lieu of Nagpal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Elections Board denied this request, the Isla Vista Party took the case to Judicial Council, going over the board’s head and filing a petition with the council on April 8. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the petition, Nagpal and Palmerin — represented through legal counsel by former senator Alexandra Gessesse and Letters and Science Senator Ricardo Uribe — argued that the Elections Board has the authority to allow for a switch in candidates after the deadline because Legal Code did “not expressly forbid a switch from taking place.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the Judicial Council agreed with Elections Board decision not to make the switch and deferred to its judgment, finding that “a switch would require steps that do violate Legal Code. “</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opinion added that Nagpal’s argument that his “<span lang=\"EN\">extenuating circumstances warrant an exception to the Legal Code” is not applicable, because Legal Code does not specifically list “extenuating circumstances” as a factor that can be used when determining a candidate’s eligibility. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision also cites Article XVIII §1(A-B) of Legal Code, which states that, “[u]nless otherwise specified in the Legal Code, the Elections Committee will have all jurisdiction in regard to election rules, policies, enforcement, and promotion at all times during the academic year.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision was signed by three judicial council members: Kimi Nasiri, Nayely Marron and Justin Nilsen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> initially attended the Monday hearing; however, Nagpal asked that the hearing be moved to a closed session, citing concerns with those outside of the council and the Election Board hearing about his health issues, and the council complied with his request. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The council’s decision in full can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Opinion.docx\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Opinion.docx\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p><i>Updated [2:26 p.m.]: This article was updated to clarify that extenuating circumstances is not a factor that can be used when determining candidate’s eligibility. </i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

A secret ballot allows each senator to anonymously write their vote down on a slip of paper. The slips of paper are then counted by the Internal Vice President (IVP) and A.S. staffers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I respect the vote,” Uribe said to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after the meeting ended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bulk of the Wednesday night, Thursday morning meeting was composed of public forum, during which approximately 90 audience members spoke to their opinions about divestment.

Attorney General Zeina Safadi spoke midway through public forum about how, after combing through this year’s resolution specifically, her office concluded that it was directional, meaning that it only needed 50% + 1 votes. If it was considered a positional resolution, it would have required a two-thirds majority to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also clarified the rules regarding abstention votes, and said that senators who abstained would have their votes counted in the majority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution’s student sponsors emphasized that this year’s resolution was not affiliated with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. However, this was a point of contention with several senators at the table, who noted that the resolution referenced BDS resolutions that had passed at other universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several senators – including On-Campus Senator Lea Toubian and proxy Noah Fleishman – left the vote crying. Both had spoken at length during the discussion about their personal experiences with anti-Semitism and how they feel unsafe on campus, noting several anti-Semitic incidents that have occurred in recent weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Toubian and Fleishman both spoke several times through the meeting against the resolution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I firmly believe this resolution provides a platform for hate,” Toubian said around 4 a.m. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fleishman echoed similar sentiments: “If we go to a secret ballot, understand the safety of the Jewish community is in your hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several senators and public forum speakers called the resolution inherently anti-Semitic and asked what tangible change it would provide for Palestinian students on campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Campus Senator Christian Ornelas emphasized throughout the meeting that A.S. UCSB had money invested in the companies listed, and public forum speakers and the student sponsors said that they did not want their tuition money to “fund the oppression of Palestinian people.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The call to divest from A.S. UCSB investments was also the reason why Safadi argued that this year’s resolution was directional, in comparison to previous years, which did not have this specific call to action.</span></p>\n<p>Further coverage can be viewed below:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The vote to pass the divestment resolution failed 10-14-0. <a href=\"https://t.co/SPIkjvOkVi\">pic.twitter.com/SPIkjvOkVi</a></p>\n<p>— Daily Nexus (@dailynexus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailynexus/status/1116309213926395905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arturo Martinez and Katherine Swartz contributed reporting</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>Updated [12:33 p.m.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

There are only two items on the agenda: the resolution to divest and the Spring Quarter 2019 elections ballot. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As this was written as a directional resolution, 50% + 1 senators must vote yes in order for the bill to pass. The divestment resolution last year </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/senate-fails-to-vote-on-divestment-after-senators-walk-out-of-meeting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">never came to a vote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as senators disagreed about whether last year’s resolution was directional or positional. A positional resolution requires a two-thirds majority to pass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Senate is composed of 24 senators, not including Internal Vice President Steven Ho; as of Wednesday morning, three senators have excused themselves for the entire meeting but will be sending proxies in their places. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is a tie, Ho will be responsible for casting the tie-breaking vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution aims to divest from 13 companies: Boeing, CNH Industrial, Caterpillar, Cemex, General Dynamics, General Electric, L-3 Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Siemens, United Technologies Corporation and Valero Energy. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Regents invested over $127 million in these companies during 2018, according to the resolution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the news that divestment would be happening on Wednesday, both anti- and pro- divestment groups created Facebook events aimed at getting more people to attend the meeting and express their opinions about the issue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/852504278434889/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-divestment Facebook event</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, created by Students Supporting Israel, described the resolution as an “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-Israel BDS resolution.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We oppose this resolution and we need your presence to demonstrate student opposition to this divisive resolution,” the Facebook description states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/408181696426375/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pro-divestment Facebook event</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, created by Students for Justice in Palestine, states that the resolution “is intended to create a critical dialogue about companies participating in human rights violations.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the resolution has been largely symbolic, because while it calls upon the UC system to divest, the A.S. Senate has not had any actual power itself to divest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this year’s resolution notes that A.S. has invested $55.771.96 in DFA Emerging Markets Social Core Portfolio; $19,627.06 in PIMCO Emerging Local Bond Fund; $1,589.28 in iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF; $1,353.00 in iShares MSCI EAFE ETF; and $2,351.25 in iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If tonight’s resolution passes, these investments would stop, Off-Campus Senator Christian Ornelas confirmed.  </span></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution in full can be viewed below: </span></p>\n<p><object class=\"pdfobj\" style=\"box-shadow: 0px 0px 2px grey;\" data=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-Divestment-Resolution.pdf\" type=\"application/pdf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px;\">If you don’t see the content of this PDF click <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019-Divestment-Resolution.pdf\">here to download it.</a></object></p>\n<p><em>Updated [4:33 p.m.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Sunday. <em>Courtesy of SBSO</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The suspects, later identified as 18-year-old Devosia Harper and 20-year-old Elijah Francis, are not locals, according to Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson; Harper primarily resides in Stockton, while Francis is from Santa Cruz. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both were reportedly in town for Deltopia, an unsanctioned street party that typically happens during the first weekend of UC Santa Barbara’s Spring Quarter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two were stopped after a UCSB police sergeant initially spotted their car driving without lights on the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road around 11 p.m. on Sunday, Hoover said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After stopping the car, the sergeant called in assistance after smelling a “strong odor of marijuana emanating from within the vehicle” and discovering that the driver did not have any identification. A separate sergeant then recognized the car as one that had been used in an armed robbery in Santa Barbara City on Saturday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon searching the vehicle, police found a firearm, a brick of cocaine, Xanax pills and five pounds of marjuana with packaging, according to Hoover. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also during this stop, two separate individuals approached the deputies to report that they had been robbed in I.V. It was then discovered that the suspects in the car were the same as those who had robbed the two victims in I.V. It was not indicated in the press release how that was discovered. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the victims had been pistol whipped on his head and had a large laceration over his eye that was bleeding,” Hoover said in a press release sent out Tuesday afternoon. “The investigation revealed the suspects in that crime were the same suspects involved in the vehicle stop.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The full charges for both include robbery, attempted robbery, conspiracy, possession of a loaded firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Harper was additionally charged with assault with a deadly weapon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both were booked at the Santa Barbara County Jail. Harper is currently being held on a $550,000 bail, but information about Francis’ bail was not immediately available. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Yaeger has written several books about beer and is featured regularly in publications including </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All About Beer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beer Advocate</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Santa Barbara Independent</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and appeared on NPR’s Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[My love for beer] began back in my college career, and I just think that the craft beer industry and the beer styles that are available have matured,” Yaeger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It just seems like the right time for the university to match the wine tasting class with the beer education class.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaeger was inspired to create such a class after he took a wine tasting class, also offered through the Rec Cen, when he was an undergraduate. He approached UCSB about teaching a class about beer last year, aiming to create one that would be on par with the wine class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I took [the wine class] and I loved it, but personally I’ve just always been more of a beer drinker and a beer fan,” he said. “And all of the beer knowledge that I have amassed, I had to sort of undergo that research by myself, but it would have been great if I could have had a course like this myself to set me on the right path.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaerger, who is also verified on Twitter and is the author of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red, White, and Brew: An American Beer Odyssey,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> described his class as a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“way for people to really get their toes wet.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you are a student… let’s just go with the premise that your alcoholic beverage consumption begins at 21 – we could put a little winky face in there. Any consumption that you may have experienced is more than likely enjoyed a very gregarious setting where the aim is to be social and not really thinking about the beverage,” he said, laughing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yaeger explained that college drinking culture doesn’t necessarily foster active thinking about the beverage or its enjoyment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For example, when you’re playing beer pong or quarters or any of those games, you’re not really thinking about how much you enjoy a drink, or what it’s made from. You just know it’s wet, it’s cold and it’s gonna have an impact.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The class is open to both students and the surrounding Goleta and Santa Barbara community for $90 for students and $95 for non-students but attendees must be 21 or older. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The class will interweave the history of beer with a series of tastings, which are arranged by country and region. For example, the first night will feature German or Continential Loggers, while the second will feature British ales, Yaeger said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“By the end, if you go to the supermarket or a bottle shop, and you see all the different brands in front of you, it’s not going to be strange and sort of foreign. You’re going to understand what those offerings are,” he said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, attendees will taste close to 40 different kinds of beer and should bring at least two wine glasses or tasting chalices, as well as “palate cleansers” such as pretzels, bread, crackers and, of course, lots of water. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students must sign up at the Rec Cen Customer Service Center. Online sign-ups are not available. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You don’t have to love every beer I’m going to pour, but you have to understand that someone loves it. And that every person who takes this class is going to leave with a broader understanding and a passion for these styles that they just didn’t even know existed before,” Yaeger said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
