I could have punched him in the nose … or I could have started screaming, or at least yelled ‘get the fuck off of me.’ But I don’t know what it is … there’s this shame of, ‘I should’ve stood up for myself because I respected myself.’ And the moment I didn’t, so what does that say about what happened, you know what I mean?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get him to let her go, Doe said she told Smith that she needed to say goodbye to her friends “because they’re waiting for me” and told him she would “come right back.” She left and texted a group chat at 11:42 p.m. that night “CODE RED” and “where are you guys” in messages she showed the Nexus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She returned to her house with a group of friends, “and we were in my room, you know, crying, and I was a little in shock, like I had no idea what was going on.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another friend who discovered Doe in her room during this time spoke to the Nexus and independently verified Doe’s recounting of the night. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Doe’s friend went to get her water, she learned of a second woman returning to their house who had allegedly also been sexually assaulted by Smith after Doe left the Sigma Pi fraternity house.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said it was this instance that pushed her to report the incident to Macke the next morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I wasn’t gonna say anything, which looking back is crazy, you know what I mean? Because you should always say something,” Doe said. “Right when I found out it was beyond me, I was like, ‘I need to report this.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next morning, she called a close friend in Sigma Pi, who arranged a meeting between her and Macke. She said she met with Macke at noon, and at 3:41 p.m. that day, she received a text from her friend in Sigma Pi saying “he’s dropped,” referring to Smith.</span></p>\n<p><b>How Greek Life Responded: </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the events of Oct. 3, Sigma Pi canceled its Midnight Madness party — one of the parties typically held every year by nearly all UCSB fraternities following the completion of rush week – Macke said in a message to the other Greek life presidents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two weeks later, on Oct. 17, the university sent out an alert about </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/two-incidents-involving-date-rape-drugs-reported-at-fraternity/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two reported incidents involving date-rape drugs on Oct. 5 at an unnamed fraternity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The university’s alert sparked heavy backlash on social media both from students and local community members, with many taking issue with the fact that the university had not included the name of the fraternity involved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe told the Nexus that the incidents of sexual assault that she reported to Macke were unrelated to the reported use of date-rape drugs mentioned in the alert.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the university alert, the UCSB Interfraternity Council (IFC) announced in an email on Oct. 18 to all IFC members that they had decided to place a five-day suspension on “all fraternity social activities” between Oct. 18 and the morning of Oct. 23. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision to suspend all social activities was made “in light of an unprecedented level of misconduct from fraternity members and concerns from local law enforcement and University administration about systemic issues within the fraternity system,” according to the email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the circulation of the fraternity member’s Facebook profile, rumors have spread around campus and Isla Vista regarding the location and alleged perpetrator of the sexual assaults. Sigma Pi’s name was mentioned by several social media accounts; one social justice-oriented Instagram account scheduled a protest walk against Sigma Pi before canceling it later that day to “give time for the victims to heal,” they wrote in a </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B32hT8YH80r/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doe said she agreed to speak with the Nexus because she needed to set the record straight. She emphasized that what happened to her “isn’t a Sigma Pi problem, and it’s not a Greek life problem.

</span><a href=\"https://www.noozhawk.com/article/assemblywoman_monique_limon_announces_candidacy_for_state_senate_20190921\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced this past

He began his political career as UC Santa Barbara’s Residential Housing Association (RHA) President during the 2012-2013 school year and the Associated Students (A.S.) </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/abboud-named-a-s-president-for-2013-14-as-opp-sweeps-elections/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">during the 2013-2014 school year. He graduated from UCSB in 2014 with a degree in political science and completed a master’s degree in technology management in 2017.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a long-term I.V. resident who has been in the college town since 2010, Abboud’s roots extend beyond the university; he was integral to the campaign that created Isla Vista’s first local government and secured funding for Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) and has served as the government’s general manager since Nov. 2017. He also currently serves as a member of the Santa Barbara City College Board of Trustees and has held the position since 2014. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud told the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nexus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an interview that for the past five years, he’s been “working on strengthening democracy in my town,” referencing his work on the Measures E, F and R campaigns to create and fund the I.V. CSD respectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve done a lot in the past nine years to contribute to the community and learn about state issues and engage with issues that affect the local and state level,” he said. “I want to take what I’ve learned of how democracy can be different here to the state level and take our values to apply to the whole state.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But his latest venture to the statewide level was brought on by “imminent issues” affecting all Californians, Abboud said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He cited “continued divestment in education,” “climate change” and “strengthening our democracy” as reasons for why he has decided to enter the race now. He added that he is the “only candidate in the race right now who has experience in the education sector.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abboud did not list any concrete points he would tackle if elected, and declined to further elaborate on his platform, stating he is “getting [his] campaign organization together.” He also declined to name his campaign managers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My philosophy as a candidate is that we all prosper only when everyone prospers,” he said. “There’s a lot of work we need to do about strengthening our democracy and making sure people can fully participate.” </span></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the </i>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano, who announced her decision at the UC Regents meeting at UC Los Angeles, took over as UC president after former President Mark Yudof resigned in 2013. She was the first woman to lead the 10-campus system and tackled several issues during her time in office, including legislation related to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in which the UC system </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-08/breaking-uc-files-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-for-unlawful-daca-repeal/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sued the government on behalf of DACA recipients</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in September 2017. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Napolitano received heavy criticism following the decision to </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-05-18/regents-vote-to-increase-nonresident-tuition-by-762/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">raise nonresident tuition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and after the reveal of a </span><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-uc-audit-20170425-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">state audit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that found the president’s office was mismanaging money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also faced protests during her initial appointment due to her </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2013/07/21/napolitano-confirmation-draws-protests-six-arrests/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">previous position</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the U.S. Secretary of Homeland security. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Wednesday’s meeting, she thanked her fellow Regents, particularly Chair John Pérez, for all of their help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe the university is on a solid path forward,” she said during the meeting. “Challenges, however, remain. With many new board members, with a new government and what will be seven years of service behind me, I think the university will benefit from some fresh blood.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a phone call afterward with media outlets, Napolitano addressed her accomplishments, pointing out that she’s held tuition flat every year except for one and saying the president’s office has made “substantial progress” in implementing the audit’s recommended changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Members of the board and members of the public can [now] track the dollars in and the dollars out of the Office of the President in a better way,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Napolitano officially steps down next August, she said she wants to focus on the same efforts she has dedicated the past year to: increasing the number of degrees awarded, closing graduate gaps, strengthening sexual assault and sexual harassment policies, increasing availability of student housing and moving forward with UC’s goal to be carbon neutral and 100% reliable on renewable energy by 2025. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was announced on Tuesday that the UC is pulling its money out of fossil fuels, </span><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/university-of-california-system-divestment-fossil-fuels-886203/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">divesting its $13.4 billion endowment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and $70 billion pension. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Napolitano denied in a phone call the claim that she was resigning due to health issues, explaining that she had gone through chemotherapy in 2016 and 2017 and is now cancer free.

id=\"caption-attachment-80692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The foot patrol is set to launch the program around the weekend of Sept. 20. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, named the Isla Vista Foot Patrol Restorative Justice Program, is set to launch around the weekend of Sept. 20, in time for UC Santa Barbara’s move-in weekend, Foot Patrol Lieutenant Juan Camarena announced during an I.V. Community Services District (I.V. CSD) meeting on Aug. 13. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Restorative justice is an approach to justice that… identifies the harm that is done, how can that harm be repaired and who is responsible,” Camarena said, adding that the purpose of such a program is to “strengthen ties between law enforcement and the community they serve.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An Isla Vista resident who violates specific Santa Barbara County ordinances – ordinance 36-2: consuming alcohol in public; 36-3: having an open container or 40-2: playing loud music outside of curfew hours – will now have the option of attending a two-hour educational workshop and completing four hours of community service instead of paying a fine. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Violating these ordinances can cost a maximum of $100 for first violation, $200 for the second violation and $500 for each additional violation that occurs within that same year, Camarena explained. </span></p>\n<p>Foot Patrol Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder added that there are additional court processing and court security fees that can add anywhere from $40 to $100 to the initial fine.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the workshops, individuals will be educated about the section they violated, how that violation affected the community around them and why the ordinance was created in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workshops will be operated by the sheriff’s office, the I.V. CSD, UCSB student organizations and long-term I.V. residents, Camarena said. The program also hopes to also partner with Santa Barbara City College to hold the workshops, as many students who attend the city college also choose to live in I.V., he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if residents choose the workshop and community service route, the violation won’t appear on their permanent record, Camarena said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[We want] education of the actual violation,” Camarena said, citing the loud music ordinance that prohibits amplified music past midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. “[The program] would go into more details of [what it means] to disturb someone’s peace.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also stated there would be an attempt on law enforcement’s part to reach out to the offenders and to ask feedback questions during the workshops, such as “How can we solve this problem that we have here? What things can we share with the community to prevent these types of violations?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the community service branch of the program, offenders will primarily work with the I.V. Recreation and Park District and the I.V. CSD. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The program] will educate the offenders of the consequences of their actions… I believe it will build trust and legitimacy in policing, it will give [law enforcement] an opportunity to reach out to the community and for the community to really understand law enforcement,” Camarena said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not just us versus them.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The I.V. CSD endorsed the program at its Aug. 27 meeting, with Board President Spencer Brandt welcoming the attempt at offering alternative punishments for violations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Education is always gonna go so much further than a slap-on-the-wrist approach,” Brandt said. </span></p>\n<p><em>Updated [3:26 p.m.]: This article was updated to include further information from Schroeder and Camarena. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

pattern of repeated harassment and retaliation, violating the California Whistleblower Protection Act – an act that prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who report violations of the law – several times over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other four other lawsuits filed against the department, </span><a

All of these lawsuits also allege violations of the Whistleblower Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern’s complaint stems from the alleged ignoring of several reported cases of misconduct that began in late 2015, and is mainly centered around five other officers: former Officer Josh Rothermel, former Officer Jeff Savaglio, former Officer Ryan Smith, Officer David Millard and Officer Amanda Siegel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the lawsuit, Stern says he raised concerns about two fellow officers – Rothermel and Savaglio, who are also mentioned in the other lawsuits – in late 2015, alleging they were “causing safety risks” by not responding to requests for backup, turning off radios and not answering phone calls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After speaking with the two about his concerns, Stern alleges he was approached by Smith, who told him that Stern’s concerns about Rothermel and Savaglio were “not valid” and threatened to write him up for “speaking with an officer under Smith’s command.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would mark the first of several interactions with Smith regarding officer misconduct; beginning June 2016, Stern alleges Smith gave Rothermel, Savaglio and Siegel preferential treatment. Additionally, as detailed in other suits, Siegel was alleged to be having an extramarital affair with Smith. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern said that any attempt to address concerns with the three’s behavior – Rothermel and Savaglio’s alleged safety risks and Siegel’s capabilities as an officer – was met with threats from Smith to write Stern up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than a year later, in February 2017, Stern alleges he was accused by outside investigators looking into the department of knowing about Rothermel and Savaglio’s “improper conduct,” but failing “to notify a proper supervisor.” He then informed investigators that he had reported the two officers’ conduct to Smith and that Smith had allegedly threatened him in response. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the following months, Stern says he was demoted from his position as corporal “without any explanation,” was not chosen for another qualified position and was excluded from receiving an award for his actions during the </span><a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2017/02/01/milo-yiannopoulos-event-canceled-violent-protests-erupt-uc-berkeley/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC Berkeley riots</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and during the </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montecito mudslides</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to court documents, Stern believes this was because he told investigators about Smith’s alleged misconduct. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from complaints about Smith, Stern also lists several allegations against his superior Millard – who is named as a defendant in the suit, alongside the UC Regents – in court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Stern, Millard allegedly lied on a university audit, ordered a dispatcher to lie to a member of the public, mismanaged the release of a trainee officer, “lacked leader and management abilities” and “refused to address issues related to retaliation against officers who made protected disclosures.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern additionally alleges that on Aug. 19, 2018, after he reported to Millard that other UCPD officers were “legitimately in fear of Smith,” Millard dismissed Stern’s concerns and refused to “address harassment concerns of his fellow officers.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millard, like Smith, is also named in the other recent UCPD lawsuits. Stern and the plaintiffs of the other lawsuits accuse Millard of covering for Smith, Savagalio and Rothermel’s behavior. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smith has not worked with the UCPD since December 2017; he filed his own lawsuit under the pseudonym John Doe against the department in March 2019, alleging that he was harassed and retailed against by his fellow officers for reporting a number of behaviors within the department. His suit detailed alleged police mockery of Chancellor Henry T. Yang, fellow officers and sexual assault and rape victims by members of the department, as well as racial discrimination and the falsification of sexual assault reports.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stern is being represented by the same lawyers representing the Littles, Signa and Reyes. He is scheduled to appear in court again in December. </span></p>\n<p>“Officer Stern filed for the same reasons his fellow officers have, because the UCSBPD and UC Regents fostered an environment of endemic discrimination,” Stern’s lawyer Antonio Castillo said in an email.</p>\n<p>“He filed because it’s long overdue that the UCSB and UC Regents take responsibility for the harm they allowed to occur.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

at their office. The individual, whose name and relation to the school was not listed, said they had heard “a large crash outside of their office followed by an audible alarm.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police responded to Webb Hall and discovered that several items were missing and that the gem and mineral display case was damaged, Estrada said in an email. No suspects were located following a search of the building. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The missing gems and minerals total 14 in all and include: one diamond, one legrandite, one mimetite, one beryl, one aquamarine, one tanzanite, one topaz, one cinnabar, one pyrargyrite, one opal, one rhodochrosite, one serandite and two pieces of gold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The police department can be contacted at (805) 893-3446. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
