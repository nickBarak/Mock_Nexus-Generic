She confirmed she is living off campus rather than on campus.</p>\n<p>As an on-campus senator, Salari is required to “live amongst [her] constituents during Fall, Winter and Spring Quarters of their year of elective service,” according to Article II Section 1(B)(4) of the Associated Students (A.S.) legal code.</p>\n<p>Salari said she intended to live on campus when she ran for the position, but cited financial burdens as the reason she was unable to.</p>\n<p>“I am an on-campus senator, and I know a lot of people are, I guess, upset about the fact that I’m living off campus,” Salari said during the meeting.</p>\n<p>“When I got elected for it, and because of some financial issues, I wasn’t able to [live on campus]. As many of you know, living on campus is more expensive.”</p>\n<p>She said she would be “more than happy” to privately discuss further details about her financial issues.</p>\n<p>Salari ran on a platform of reinforcing UCSB’s student health care system, citing early closing hours and the lack of an urgent care system.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Attorney General Zeina Safadi sent out an email to all senators to discuss Salari’s standing.</p>\n<p>Safadi said A.S. Elections Board initially approached Salari to ask about her living situation after they had received a complaint, to which she “did not provide a conclusive answer.”</p>\n<p>“There was no prior indication to Senate as a whole that Yasamin was in financial burden and thus Yasamin was not transparent about this situation; with that, there was an active effort to conceal,” Safadi said in the email.</p>\n<p>“Furthermore, the initial refusal to answer questions about her living situation solidifies the lack of transparency, and thus indicates her acknowledgement of violating the rule and the subsequent concealment of the violation.”</p>\n<p>Safadi added that “concealing the truth about not living among your representative constituents is a direct violation of [A.S.] Legal Code.”</p>\n<p>During Wednesday night’s Senate meeting, Senate voted to give Salari a one-time exception with the stipulation that her living situation would be later discussed within the A.S. Internal Committee.</p>\n<p>Several senators also discussed permanently changing legal codes to allow for future exceptions. There was no motion made regarding legal code changes.</p>\n<p><em>Correction [Nov. 16]: Salari did not specify the exact location of where she is living, only stating she is living off campus. That information was obtained from the email from A.G. and has been removed from this article at Salari’s request. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Now that the appellate court has definitively rejected this argument, the university calls on the administration to stop its efforts to rescind the program.”</p>\n<p>Under the Trump Administration, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke initially motioned to eliminate the DACA program in September 2017.</p>\n<p>Duke argued the program was “illegal from its inception” under the Obama Administration.</p>\n<p>UC <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-09-08/breaking-uc-files-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-for-unlawful-daca-repeal/\">filed a lawsuit</a> challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to repeal the program shortly after.</p>\n<p>The DACA program allows undocumented residents who were brought into the U.S. as children to apply for “two-year renewable periods” allowing them to stay in the U.S.</p>\n<p>In order to be eligible to apply, individuals must have clean criminal records and meet “various educational or military service requirements,” court documents state.</p>\n<p>In wake of Thursday’s decision, UC urged all eligible DACA recipients to renew their grants.</p>\n<p>“While today’s ruling is welcome news, we stress that DACA recipients deserve better than to see their life prospects rise and fall based on events in litigation.

This this is just a basic payment,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“Public service is absolutely important and we’re privileged to do the work that we do, but we want to make sure that people who want to get involved in their community and serve in this capacity can have at least a little more assistance and financial security.”</p>\n<p>The resolution passed with four yes votes and one abstention by Director Thurlow.</p>\n<p>Directors also have the option to waive their payments or accept the money and immediately return it to the board, an option Thurlow said he would be following.</p>\n<p>There is approximately $16,800 in allocations for the year to compensate directors for their time, according to the I.V. CSD’s 2018-19 budget.</p>\n<p>The board has been discussing this for about two months, following an acquisition of the I.V. CSD’s funding through Measure R, Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD’s policy committee is creating a policy for what can be reimbursed. The committee will discuss this during its Policy Committee Regular meeting on Nov. 8.</p>\n<p>“This is something that will make service in the board of directors more inclusive,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“We recognize that we have very limited finances, and we want to be respectful of that while also making sure there’s a basic level of pay to just assist with the incredible amount of work that goes into this.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Quarter 2017 after Santa Barbara Judge Thomas P. Anderle ruled that the school violated the due process requirements of the federal and state constitutions by pre-determining John’s guilt, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>“Instead of making that decision based upon facts, the law, and in fairness, [UCSB] has decided to do it their own way,” Anderle wrote in court documents.</p>\n<p>A separate panel of UCSB administrators reviewed the case in May 2018 and ultimately cleared him of all charges. The court ruled on Oct. 23 that John would be awarded court costs of $4,714.91.</p>\n<p>In its decision, the panel found that, “had the University considered available evidence at the inception of the case… John Doe’s suspension and charges probably would not have occured.”</p>\n<p>The panel “chastised” UCSB for “its failure to conduct even a rudimentary investigation before charging,” said Bob Ottilie, John’s attorney.</p>\n<p>As of October 2018, John is attending a different university.</p>\n<p>This is the third case the Nexus has reported on in recent months <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-08-15/uc-regents-found-in-contempt-of-court-expelled-student-allowed-to-return-to-ucsb/\">involving</a> the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/sb-superior-court-reverses-ucsb-students-suspension-for-sexual-assault/\">reversal</a> of a Title IX case.</p>\n<p>John, a San Diego resident, was initially suspended after his former high school girlfriend, referred to as Jane Doe in court documents, posted a video online after an argument between the two.</p>\n<p>Both were 17 years of age and living in San Diego at the time of the alleged argument on Aug. 13, 2016. John was enrolled at UCSB at that time, but had not yet officially begun attending classes.</p>\n<p>According to court documents, John and Jane got into an argument over his private social media accounts. When John saw his girlfriend recording the argument, there was a “scuffle for the phone,” court documents stated.</p>\n<p>His girlfriend “left an impression” in the video that John hit her. John denied that he threatened or hit her.</p>\n<p>After an unaffiliated UCSB student saw the video on Jane’s public Twitter account and reported it to UCSB, University of California Police Department (UCPD) detectives from UCSB drove down to San Diego and arrested John. He was placed in a juvenile detention facility in San Diego.</p>\n<p>John was later released into the custody of his mother on Sep. 2 after a judge found that he was not a threat to anyone.</p>\n<p>UCPD did not inform the San Diego Police Department of John’s case, making this the first case in the country where an arrest was ordered by the Title IX office, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Ottilie called UCSB’s charges and behavior “outrageous” in a press release sent out Thursday.</p>\n<p>“The University suspended this poor kid in September 2016, and totally barred him from campus, and then failed to even initiate a meaningful Title IX investigation for months,” Ottilie said in a press release.</p>\n<p>“This was what so offended the court; his suspension was tied to an investigation that initially never went forward, and when it did, he was totally exonerated. Why did it take 19 months when the University never presented any evidence that it did not have 19 months earlier.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Doe’s girlfriend is referred to in court documents as Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p>Roe had consumed wine, beer and mango margaritas that night and said she had felt “pretty drunk” and decided to sleep on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed in the apartment’s living room.</p>\n<p>She stated she woke at an unknown time, “completely disoriented,” to an “intense, throbbing pain.”</p>\n<p>Roe said she pretended to be asleep because she did not want a confrontation while her assaulter allegedly “unhooked [her] bra”; “suck[ed] and bit” her for several minutes; “[took] photos of her naked breasts” and repeatedly “penetrated [her] vagina and anus” with his fingers and/or penis.</p>\n<p>She said she realized it was Doe when her assaulter stopped and got up from the bed, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Roe was medically examined by the Santa Barbara County Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) two days after the alleged assault.</p>\n<p>The SART report said there was “bruising and laceration noted in the anal area,” according to University of California Police Department (UCPD) Detective Dawn Arviso.</p>\n<p>However, neither Roe nor the detective provided a full copy of the SART report with this information attached during the trial.</p>\n<p>“The SART report was critical evidence,” court documents state. “At a minimum UCSB should have required the detective to provide a complete copy of the SART report.”</p>\n<p>Roe’s story that night also conflicted with Eyewitness One’s report.</p>\n<p>Following the alleged assault, Roe said Eyewitness One approached the bed and screamed when she saw that Roe’s “bottom half” was completely bare.</p>\n<p>Eyewitness One testified over Skype that Roe was wearing a short-sleeve shirt and underwear when she got up from the bed, contradicting Roe’s claim. She also denied screaming.</p>\n<p>The mattress was also absent of “any visible signs or smells of bodily fluids” consistent with anal or vaginal penetration, according to Eyewitness One.</p>\n<p><strong>JOHN DOE</strong></p>\n<p>Doe denied all of Roe’s accusations.</p>\n<p>He said he arrived at the apartment at approximately 12:30 a.m. that night and was “very intoxicated.”</p>\n<p>By Eyewitness One’s recommendation, he lay down, fully dressed, on the bottom bunk next to Roe because the top bunk was covered in luggage. He reportedly first heard about Doe’s allegations when she “woke [him] up by basically yelling about someone hurting her.”</p>\n<p>He argued three main points in his defense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The distance between the couch and the bunk bed in the living room was too close for him to have done anything without being noticed by Eyewitness One and Eyewitness Two.</li>\n<li>He could not have unhooked Roe’s bra because his neurological disorder, a “form of palsy,” affects his motor skills when he is tired or drunk.</li>\n<li>Roe’s antidepressant medication, Viibryd, has side effects including hallucinations, sleep paralysis and night terrors, which can become severe when mixed with alcohol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doe was not allowed to include the antidepressant medication evidence in his defense because he did not have an expert present, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>The SB Superior Court stated he was not given enough time to find an expert, again showing a lack of due process.</p>\n<p>The full court documents can be viewed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/B283229.pdf\">here</a>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

CSD postponed the decision on whether or not to include a low-income exemption with the UUT. <em>Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>I.V. voters passed the User Utility Tax (UUT) through Measure R, which was on the Santa Barbara Spring 2018 elections ballot.</p>\n<p>The UUT, an eight percent tax on electricity, gas, garbage disposal, sewage and water services, is the I.V. Community Services District’s main source of funding. It will <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19_5ItKDEy3CwUFvd-mRuIuIww-VKa3cwgk4pOAD35sM/edit#gid=1092095724\">net</a> approximately $777,000 a year for the district.</p>\n<p>The “Yes on Measure R” crew championed the tax as a way to finally give I.V. residents a voice in government following the district’s creation in Spring 2017.</p>\n<p>Prominent advocates for the tax – including I.V. CSD Secretary Spencer Brandt, I.V. CSD President Ethan Bertrand and I.V. CSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud – campaigned on the promise of a low-income exemption for those who cannot afford the tax.</p>\n<p>Four months later, that promise remains in stasis.</p>\n<p>Brandt told the Nexus in June that the CSD was currently in the process of finalizing a low-income exemption.</p>\n<p>“If there are households in Isla Vista that cannot afford to pay the tax, even though it is going to be very small, I think that it is very important that we do not put that extra burden on them,” Brandt said in June.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD, which meets twice a month, has discussed the low-income exemption extensively at two of its meetings since UUT’s passing.</p>\n<p>However, the six-member board has not made any progress regarding the exemption and instead has discussed not implementing a low-income exemption for the tax.</p>\n<p>“[Isla Vista] is a poverty hotspot, and as we all know, there is a large student population here that is not exactly rolling in money,” Bertrand said during the district’s Oct. 9 meeting. “It’s hard to grant exemptions to anyone.”</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD board members, such as Vice President Natalie Jordan, said it is hard to determine which households in I.V. are low-income because several households only have one name on certain utilities.</p>\n<p>She pointed to her own living situation in I.V. as an example.</p>\n<p>“[My household] receive[s] a discounted rate on electricity already because we have that one [low-income] person written onto the bill,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Other members, such as director Father Jon Hedges, argued all residents should pay the tax because of the voice the I.V. CSD gives the community.</p>\n<p>“The whole premise of the CSD was participatory democracy, a voice for our community, that we not be voiceless the way we’ve been for decades,” Hedges said.</p>\n<p>“It seems to me that the cost of a small bill per month is a small price to pay.”</p>\n<p>The issue on the table during the Oct. 9 meeting was whether or not to exempt I.V.’s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vQhq8YjtkADsaqdHp8X7JumSONytqJPNLKQdu_csyms/edit#gid=0\">non-profit</a> housing providers, such as Friendship Manor and the SB Housing Co-op. The latter is composed of five houses: Newman, Merton, Bike, Manely and De Shain.</p>\n<p>I.V. CSD Director George Thurlow argued if one group is allowed to be exempt, such as the non-profits, then it would create problems for everyone.</p>\n<p>“Once we say, ‘Your folks don’t have to pay the four dollars a month,’ you’re gonna open the floodgates, because every student in this town is for [the exemption],” he said.</p>\n<p>The issue was tabled until February 2019, when the district will have a better sense of its finances, according to Hedges.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD is working toward “some sort of exemption or reduction,” though not necessarily a low-income exemption, Bertrand said to the Nexus following the meeting.</p>\n<p>“I wish we would address it now, but we can address it then, too,” Bertrand said.</p>\n<p>“I struggle with this one because while [there is a] small amount of money that would be saved, it’s still something that we really — for the past few years now — mentioned some sort of utility reduction or exemption for low-income folks.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: The final quote is attributed Bertrand, not Brandt. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Elections Board website.</p>\n<p>“Far too frequently we are seeing landlords unwilling to cooperate with students in our demands to have housing — in our demands to have our repairs done in manageable ways that we aren’t paying for,” Mello said to the <em>Nexus</em> during the 2018 Spring Quarter election.</p>\n<p>Shadpour, who ran with Campus United (CU), won the highest percentage of first choice votes with 8.54 percent.</p>\n<p>He transferred to the University of Southern California (USC) over the summer and resigned from his position as senator.</p>\n<p>“After months of deliberation and hard decisions I decided to transfer to the USC Marshall School of Business, where I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration,” he said.</p>\n<p>Shadpour said he is disappointed that he will not be serving as senator, but is “confident in the abilities of the [69th] senate” to do a great job.</p>\n<p>Mello could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>This article will be updated.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Elections Board</em>, co-authored by UCSB 2018 graduate and former Isla Vista Party (IVP) head Nawar Nemeh and Morales, asks the Council to reconsider Morales’ disqualification as External Vice President for Statewide Affairs (EVPSA).</p>\n<p>The second case, <em>Nemeh</em> v. <em>Campus United</em>, alleges that Campus United (CU) “engaged in slander” of IVP during the election. Nemeh asks that the Council remove all senators and executives who ran with CU from their current positions.</p>\n<p>The Council initially dismissed the latter case. Nemeh then filed a motion to reconsider the case, according to documents obtained by the Nexus from an anonymous source.</p>\n<p>However, the Council lost its quorum just before the 2017-2018 school year ended, leading to a paralyzing situation: Nemeh’s motion and the disqualification case cannot currently be ruled on due to the unprecedented number of vacancies.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Brooke Kopel <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/judicial-council-slots-remain-unfilled-as-senate-postpones-chair-vote/\">must make four appointments to the Council</a> before they are able to return to regular precedings. Until this occurs, these cases will remain in stasis.</p>\n<p><em>NEMEH AND MORALES </em>V.<em> ELECTIONS BOARD</em></p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Board disqualified Morales from the position of EVPSA in May when it was discovered she was not enrolled in school during spring quarter.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Legal Code, an executive candidate must be enrolled in at least six units per quarter to be eligible for office.</p>\n<p>Morales gave no comment at the time of her disqualification in mid-May.</p>\n<p>In the petition, Morales and Nemeh request that the Council overrule the disqualification and “investigate the reasoning behind the Elections Board scrutinizing the registration status of Mayela as opposed to all candidates on the ballot.”</p>\n<p>According to the petition, she challenged her academic standing with UCSB on the grounds that she had a personal emergency that required her to leave Isla Vista for a period of time.</p>\n<p>Morales and Nemeh argue the disqualification was in “blatant violation” of elections code because the board had not informed Morales of its decision soon enough.</p>\n<p>They also claim there was a partisan bias in place, calling the fact that the Board choose to focus on Morales rather than another candidate, a “peculiarity.”</p>\n<p>“The A.S. Elections Board has shown a deep disrespect for Mayela’s person, the Isla Vista Party, and the voters on campus who overwhelmingly chose her as their next External Vice President of Statewide Affairs,” the petition states.</p>\n<p>The Elections Board is currently holding a special election for the EVPSA position. However, if the Council rules in favor of Nemeh and Morales, Morales could be reinstated in her position, causing the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/madeline-loudon-is-sole-declared-candidate-for-evpsa-special-election/\">special election</a> results to become void.</p>\n<p><em>NEMEH </em>V. <em>CAMPUS UNITED</em></p>\n<p>In the petition, Nemeh alleges that CU was able to “improperly influence” the spring quarter election results through, among other matters, “engaging in slander” regarding IVP.</p>\n<p>The Nexus first heard of these allegations in mid-May and saw the evidence referenced in the case through an anonymous submitter. The Nexus was unable to pursue these allegations further at the time.</p>\n<p>The “evidence” Nemeh refers to in the petition can be seen below:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84189\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84189\" data-attachment-id=\"84189\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/petitions-regarding-a-s-spring-elections-remain-undecided-as-judicial-council-unable-to-meet-quorum/screenshots-for-article/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"screenshots for article\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-84189 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/screenshots-for-article.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84189\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of anonymous submitter </em></p></div>\n<p>Zeising and Salari could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>“In no way did CU instruct anyone to lie,” Kopel said in an interview with the Nexus. “I have no reason to believe that if the previous council dismissed the case then the new council won’t dismiss the case as well.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh declined to comment for this article.</p>\n<p>If the Council agrees to reconsider this case, and then subsequently finds CU leadership at fault for violating Student Conduct policy, then all senators and executives who ran with CU could potentially be removed from their positions.

22-year-old Santa Barbara City College student was the victim of an attempted rape in Isla Vista early Wednesday morning, according to police.</p>\n<p>The student was walking near the corner of Camino Pescadero and Picasso around 12:15 a.m. when an unknown suspect “emerged from the bushes” and began to punch her in the face and head,” Kelly Hoover, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) spokesperson, said.</p>\n<p>The suspect – described as a 5’9” dark-skinned male in his 20s who was wearing a dark hoodie and dark pants – then covered the victim’s mouth and forced her into the bushes before attempting to pull off her shirt.</p>\n<p>She was able to escape and run to her residence, Hoover said.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UC Santa Barbara police officers searched the area
