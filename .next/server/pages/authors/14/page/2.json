American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299 (AFSCME 3299) patient care and service workers have been without a contract for just under two years — reaching an agreement with the UC is a “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">testament to our members’ commitment,” AFSCME President Kathryn Lybarger said in a press release sent out by the union. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This has been a long and hard process that required both sides to seek common ground and work in good faith,” Lybarger said. “But it has brought important issues to light about the growing problem of income inequality, the fight for what’s left of America’s middle class and how large public institutions can uplift the communities they serve.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC similarly welcomed an agreement with the union. The contracts were “achieved through the hard work and good faith efforts of the AFSCME and UC negotiating teams,” UC Board of Regents Chair John A.

UC Student Association (UCSA) President Varsha Sarveshwar said that the UC Regents are required to give students and UCSA notice at least 30 days ahead of time if they are considering a tuition increase — in this instance, Sarveshwar said her organization was “not explicitly told that [the Regents] would be considering a tuition increase of five years.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re entitled to this period of notice; we don’t feel like we received it,” she said, noting that, to the Regents’ credit, they “took those concerns seriously and said, ‘You know, you’re right.’” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re happy to see these concerns taken into account … It’s a small victory,” Sarveshwar added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UCSA “oppose any efforts to increase the tuition burden on individual students,” and circulated </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fe29yE-QD6Tq_l8_EvlHELKp23fB7_lAsMrFQlDEsXc/edit?fbclid=IwAR0gNd3FtIkXZ7ycGnGD1dsZGkS52DDoTsbPUDsOf80sHH9b5-Nm2eHTxrA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a petition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ahead of the three-day Regents meeting, lasting from Jan. 21 to Jan. 23.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The petition brings up several concerns about the tuition models, noting that a cohort-based tuition model would drastically affect non-residents who receive no financial aid and that the model relies on guaranteed funding from the state of California, which could be “extremely difficult to maintain when state revenues begin to fall.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In an economic downturn, the UC may be forced to increase tuition unfairly on incoming students, or abandon the model altogether,” the petition states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the petition, UCSA also encouraged students to attend the Regents meeting  to voice their concerns.

SBSO</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, aimed at curbing the number of citations issued in Isla Vista, allows residents who have violated one of three ordinances — ordinance 36-2, consuming alcohol in public; 36-3, having an open container; or 40-2, playing loud music outside of curfew hours — the chance to wipe the violations from their permanent record.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The program, which </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/foot-patrol-to-launch-restorative-justice-program-offering-alternative-punishment-for-ordinance-violators/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launched</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> officially on Oct. 4, was advertised as a way to create a “bridge between law enforcement and the community” — the same sentiment that has been advertised in other programs Schroeder has created since taking the position of </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-05/foot-patrol-welcomes-new-i-v-community-resource-deputy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista’s community resource deputy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in December 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents must attend a class, typically taught by Schroeder and members of the UC Santa Barbara Police Department, and perform a number of community service hours. Guest speakers are also invited to talk to residents about the impact their actions have on others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting from the program’s launch on Oct. 4 to Jan. 6, 58 people received citations for one of the three violations listed above. Of the 58 people, 49 signed up to attend the class; 31 have finished the classes but have not yet completed the community service portion, according to Schroeder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We saw a huge peak [in attendance] when it first launched, which was right before Halloween,” Schroeder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He noted that there was a “significant drop” during UC Santa Barbara’s winter break, a period in which most students leave Isla Vista for the three-week gap between quarters. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to be eligible to have a citation waived, residents must register for the program in person at the Isla Vista Foot Patrol and have to complete the classes themselves within 90 days. Schroeder hopes to launch an app in the near future that would allow residents to sign up using their smartphones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The typical class is two hours long and begins with a brief history of Isla Vista, discussing more “high-profile” incidents that newer students may not know about. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees also are guided through an interactive activity, in which they attempt to solve a community problem. Schroeder and guest speakers also explain why certain policies are in place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He added that they additionally go into “how people can make safer choices when using alcohol and drugs — not necessarily telling them not to do it, but how to do it safely.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, it has been a “mostly good mix” of UCSB and Santa Barbara City College students attending the classes, Schroeder said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three classes have been held so far, and the typical class sees between 15 and 20 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schroeder also noted that citations issued in Isla Vista are down 50% from last year, a fact he attributed in part to Isla Vista outreach programs, such as the</span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/sheriffs-office-rolls-out-party-registration-program-for-isla-vista/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Party Registration Program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which launched last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re not lecturing these people — we really are trying to work with them to make sure crimes are reduced in the future. They’re part of the group solving the solutions,” he noted. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) served a search warrant on the 6700 block of Del Playa Drive, according to a press release sent out by SBSO Saturday morning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“During the search, detectives recovered numerous items that were taken during the robbery and they arrested two suspects,” Raquel Zick, SBSO spokesperson, said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meteke was charged with robbery and false imprisonment and booked on a $100,000 bail, while Hebbar faces accessory charges with a $20,000 bail. Hebbar is a UCSB student, according to the student directory; Meteke’s custody logs state he is a student, but the name of the college he attends is not listed.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2 p.m. on Saturday, Meteke is still in custody, according to custody logs. Hebbar is no longer in custody. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investigation is ongoing, Zick said in the press release. </span></p>\n<p>No further suspects have been arrested as of Monday, Zick told the Nexus.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unknown whether the police have located the third suspect involved in the incident. SBSO did not immediately return requests for comment involving the arrests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initial reports came in around 10:23 a.m. on Nov. 18 that three individuals had fled a house on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde Road in Isla Vista after reportedly robbing two victims at gunpoint. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two victims had been inside the apartment at the time; one sustained minor injuries. The suspects took two laptops, one phone, one wallet and cannabis, police said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zick said at the time that police believed the victims were “specifically targeted.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of the suspects — a white man wearing a ski mask and all black and a white man wearing no ski mask and camouflage — were armed with handguns, while the third, a black man who was wearing all black, was reportedly not carrying a gun. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updated [Nov. 25, 12:44 p.m.]</span></i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Senate through a resolution authored by Letters and Science Senator Olivia Campos and Off-Campus Senator Tianna White; however, it was Sir who first proposed the idea during her presidential campaign in the Spring Quarter 2019 election.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re keeping it simple,” Sir said to the Nexus, explaining that ideally, the app will have two main features: a “feed” with all Office of Student Life (OSL) organizations and A.S. events </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">similar to other social media apps, with reminders that can be customized to each student </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a notification system that would inform students of free food available on campus.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is, for example, a “catered event on campus with lots of leftover food” the app would then alert students, Sir explained. Users can also input their food preferences into the app and indicate any food allergies they might have. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is gonna be the hook that brings people in,” Sir said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sir, who has spoken to the Nexus several times regarding the project, said her goal is to bring “A.S. out of the dark ages” with the app, which would contain all A.S. and OSL-related sources in one place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos and White’s resolution echoed several of Sir’s points, stating A.S. resources “are in need of being updated and more readily available to the student body.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The student body does not have a cohesive source of information regarding Associated Students and the Office of Student Life events and meetings,” the resolution states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campos said that Sir initially approached the Senate a few weeks ago, looking for the senators’ support for her project. Campos and White then offered to write the resolution in support of the app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The app] follows closely with a lot of things we hoped to accomplish as a 70th Senate,” Campos said to the Nexus. She added that she believes the app will make it easier for students to see the programs and resources available to them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Senate’s meeting on Wednesday night, College of Engineering Senator Diana Reyes Carrillo brought up her concerns about the app, pointing out that creating it would be “time consuming” and that it is “naive” to start the process of creating an app if there “hasn’t been research if students want one.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reyes Carrillo abstained from the final vote. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hiring of a developer would be handled by A.S. Executive Director Marisela Márquez, according to the resolution. During Senate, Internal Vice President Alli Adam explained that a “significant portion” of the app has already been built by UCSB Information Technology (I.T.) and that a software developer would bring the “final touch.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adam said that Márquez plans to hire a developer within two months but does not know how long it will take the hired developer to finish the work started by I.T. </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Thomas Anderle, according to Unander, who advised the plaintiffs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander, who has been with the Legal Resource Center since 2003, said that across the 18 cases, the total amount sought from the management company was $24,215. Of that, the plaintiffs received $13,785 back in money initially put into security deposits and $1,200 in “bad faith” charges — meaning the plaintiffs proved the management company had acted in violation of an agreement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unander emphasized that from her perspective, the owners of Isla Vista Luxury Living hadn’t acted in a malicious manner </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they just “clearly didn’t have a handle on the law the way they thought they did,” and that these cases were “a real education for them.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think this landlord learned a lot in the three days we were in court,” she said. “They didn’t consider that they were abusing the tenants’ deposits. They really felt they were entitled to take what they took.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 12 properties listed on the Isla Vista Luxury Living website: 760 Embarcadero Del Norte, 6656 Picasso, 6659 Abrego , 6599 Madrid, 6565 Segovia, 6629 Sabado Tarde, 910 Camino Pescadero, 897 Camino Del Sur, 6578 Trigo, 6510 Sabado Tarde, 6508 Seville and 6517 El Greco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isla Vista Luxury Living was created in July 2018, according to California business records. Its owners are Bijan Moshayedi and his father, Mike, who currently resides in Newport Beach; according to Unander and several of the tenants who spoke to the Nexus, a man named Keenan Duran serves as the properties’ manager. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, it was during Spring Quarter 2019 and the beginning of summer that the Isla Vista Tenants Union saw an uptick in the number of people coming in. While the union typically sees an increase when leases end, she noticed that a large number of people were complaining about the same landlord: Isla Vista Luxury Living. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One tenant, Tyler Wells, created a Facebook group to help keep track of all the complaints; as of Thursday, the group has 92 members. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past several months, tenants have posted complaints and concerns about I.V. Luxury Living to the group, including duplicate charges, not receiving receipts for work done, charges for what they believed to be normal wear and tear, alleged excess charges for painting and carpet cleaning, among others </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one plaintiff posted about a $120 billing charge he received for a broken toilet paper holder, and another said they were charged $45 to replace a lightbulb. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One plaintiff and member of the Facebook group, Natalie Mazmanian in the case of Mazmanian v. Isla Vista Luxury Living, told the Nexus that, among other charges she later disputed, she had been charged for a water filter in her apartment at 760 Embarcadero Del Norte </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a water filter that had never existed in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It was more the principles than it was money, honestly,” Mazmanian told the Nexus. “It was a year [under their] management, and all we ever did was have problems … [Duran] had no sort of management skills coming into this.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mazmanian was also charged $559 for a cleaning fee, $90 to replace two lights in the living room and for water damage for kitchen cabinets </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">water damage, she said, that was caused by the absence of a water filter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, the Moshayedis’ first property was acquired when Bijan was a student at UC Santa Barbara in 2009. Bijan’s name is attached to at least nine properties in the Santa Barbara area, according to Santa Barbara clerk recorder records. Mike’s is attached to at least one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University spokesperson Andrea Estrada confirmed that someone with the name Bijan Moshayedi attended UCSB between Fall Quarter 2007 and Summer 2011. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bijan Moshayedi and Duran did not respond to requests for comment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Unander, the Moshayedis created Isla Vista Luxury Living after splitting from its former management company, Meridian Group Real Estate, during the summer of 2018.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deedy Hedrick, a property supervisor for Meridian who managed the Moshayedis’ properties from 2014 to summer 2018, also testified in support of some of the plaintiffs, according to Unander. Hedrick testified in one case that the amount the plaintiffs were charged for cleaning was double than what was typically charged for “extra heavy cleaning,” according to court documents. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the eight cases that went to trial, all received money back, although the amounts awarded varied. But in two cases </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pena et al v. Isla Vista Luxury Living and McBride et al v. Isla Vista Luxury Living </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Judge Anderle found that the management company had acted in bad faith and awarded the plaintiffs the full security deposits plus additional compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Court spent hours on this case trying to ferret out what and why the events occurred,” Judge Anderle wrote in his decision in Pena v. Isla Vista Luxury Living. He stated that the management company had “vastly overcharged in this case” and that the plaintiffs did “everything that could be expected of tenants.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Plaintiffs] did a thorough job of documenting the move-in and move-out. On the other hand the Luxury Living documentation was cursory at best and irresponsible at worst,” he added. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pena, a Santa Barbara City College student who asked to be referred to only by her last name, explained that when she and her partner first moved into their apartment at 6565 Segovia, it was managed by Meridian. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But once Isla Vista Luxury Living took over, she said the manager, Duran repeatedly ignored her requests for routine maintenance, even one request for him to fix the “staples or nails” coming out of the carpet. When it did come time to move out, the company did not return any of her deposit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She added that she and her partner “took pictures of everything” and “had every [communication with Duran] in text,” which she said is likely why she was awarded the full security deposit plus additional compensation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In McBride v. Isla Vista Luxury Living, Judge Anderle awarded the plaintiffs their full security deposit back, as well as an additional $314, in part because Duran had “told the plaintiffs there were ‘no problems’ … leading them to conclude they would get their security deposit back.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The judge added that there was nothing in the move-out report “that reflects any viable issues.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelsey McBride, a class of 2019 graduate, told the Nexus that when she moved out of her apartment, her and her roommates “cleaned for two days,” adding that “it was in better condition that when we moved in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But after they moved out, even though Duran had told McBride </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with her mother as a witness </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that her whole security deposit would be returned, they only received three quarters of what they had been told. They were also charged hundreds of dollars for carpet cleaning and painting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did nothing wrong,” McBride said. “They owed us money.
