Currently, internet service providers like Verizon and AT&amp;T can’t charge websites to deliver content faster than other websites.</p>\n<p>The FCC now plans to vote on a repeal of network neutrality on Dec. 14, which would allow internet service providers to potentially serve users with extra charges and block, slow or speed up access to specific websites.</p>\n<p>Dylan Bolf, UC Santa Barbara Residential Computer Network (ResNet) technician, said that because UCSB purchases its bandwidth in bulk from a Tier 1 network, it was treated “neutrally” before the 2015 regulations were in place.</p>\n<p>A Tier 1 network is the overarching “backbone” of the internet, according to Bolf. By purchasing from a Tier 1 network, the university acts as a service provider for students.</p>\n<p>Regular consumers buy internet from Tier 3, which includes internet service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T and Cox, and would be subject to the new rules.</p>\n<p>Jay Freeman, a software engineer and board member of the Isla Vista Community Services District, explained that service providers like Comcast may want to repeal net neutrality to reduce risk and manage costs.</p>\n<p>Because customers demand unlimited internet plans to handle all their needs, Freeman said service companies must anticipate internet usage and predict how it might spike or fluctuate in the future.</p>\n<p>“They have essentially forced internet service providers in this horrible position of being insurance companies,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Their response to this is ‘we want the ability to charge somebody for the increase in bandwidth use by Netflix, whether it be Netflix or whether it be the user watching Netflix’… That is an argument that I can appreciate,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>“It is still an argument that I find scary because I’ve seen absolute power corrupt absolutely,” he said.</p>\n<p>If the repeal goes through, the FCC would essentially restore “the internet to the state that it was two years ago,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>Before Obama-era rules were implemented, residential users were the target of “extra charges and other net neutrality violating ideas,” Bolf said.</p>\n<p>For example, AT&amp;T blocked Apple’s FaceTime app from its data plan in 2012. If customers wanted to use the FaceTime app outside of Wi-Fi, they had to pay extra for an unlimited plan.</p>\n<p>Open internet advocacy groups claimed this was a violation of net neutrality, and AT&amp;T backed down before the groups filed an official complaint with the FCC.</p>\n<p>“We hope that we will be treated neutrally again if these rules are repealed, and would not violate the principles of net neutrality ourselves,” Bolf said in an email, explaining that UCSB would not manipulate the speed of any website.</p>\n<p>He added that ResNet “stands unanimously” behind the current net neutrality rules and hopes they remain in place.</p>\n<p>However, if the FCC does moves forward with the repeal, Bolf said ResNet would make sure the “students and residents are not impacted in any way that we can.”</p>\n<p>Matthew Hall, UCSB’s associate vice chancellor and chief information officer, said a cable company could artificially limit bandwidth to make certain services more appealing.</p>\n<p>“Imagine if AT&amp;T is the exclusive partner of Spotify and you can’t get Pandora on AT&amp;T without it hitting your bandwidth cap,” Hall said in an email.</p>\n<p>There will be an economic, innovational and choice impact to consumers in residential areas, Hall said, but “life on our UC campuses continues unchanged in the short term.”</p>\n<p>State senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents all of Santa Barbara County and western Ventura County, opposed the repeal saying it would set a “very dangerous precedent.”</p>\n<p>“I think the most important thing is that [the repeal] will allow money interests to control content, to control access, to ultimately control thought,” Jackson said.</p>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal said large, wealthy institutions like universities would be able to afford higher-quality internet, while a student startup wouldn’t be able to compete with large businesses.</p>\n<p>“We need to ensure the internet is a fair and even playing field for all and continue to bridge our country’s existing digital divide,” he said. “That disparity will only grow if we do not act to protect net neutrality rules.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.4 of the Dec. 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.

Tenants brought their issues with renting in I.V. to the I.V. Tenants Union’s town hall. Will Tran / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Daniel Renteria, chair of the I.V. Tenants Union (IVTU) and a fourth-year political science and communications double major, led the town hall in the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic building. The majority of the students present were Associated Students (A.S.) senators who spoke of their own issues with I.V. landlords.</p>\n<p>Several tenants expressed frustration about communicating with their landlords, citing incidents where their landlords had not responded to repeated emails or texts.</p>\n<p>Ron Perry, A.S. Legal Resource Center Staff Attorney, said that physical correspondence like “snail mail” is still the best way to communicate with landlords in the event of an issue, because some judges “still have a hard time with electronic communication” in court.</p>\n<p>He added that students should “always document” any communication that happens between themselves and their landlords.</p>\n<p>Anthony Pimentel, an A.S. off-campus senator and third-year political science major, said he has had disputes with his landlord in the past over getting his full security deposit back.</p>\n<p>“We’re only expecting a few hundred at worst to be deducted from our security deposit for average wear and tears,” he said.</p>\n<p>Pimentel said he was charged “outrageous prices” for carpet replacement, as well as for appliances and paint jobs throughout the house that had already been worn down before they moved in. He said he photographed these before moving in.</p>\n<p>Perry encouraged students to check landlords’ previous court disputes before signing a housing contract and to take pictures of the condition of the house before moving in like Pimentel had done.</p>\n<p>“We see the same landlords over and over and over again,” Perry said. “There’s a record of that, of course, you can go to the court or go online.”</p>\n<p>Renteria said that issues between tenants and landlords arise when students rent from “a few large corporations and multi-millionaire landlords” that “have overstepped their legal boundaries.”</p>\n<p>Renteria also said that I.V.’s limited housing contributes to poor landlord-tenant relations, claiming that I.V. has a vacancy rate of under half of a percent. A “healthy” housing market has a vacancy rate of five percent, he said.</p>\n<p>Some students in attendance expressed concerns about the lack of carbon monoxide detectors and fire alarms in their apartments, as well as issues with returns on security deposits.</p>\n<p>Landlords are required to have carbon monoxide detectors in apartments and failure to do so is in violation of California law, Perry said.</p>\n<p>“If you convince the judge that your landlord knew about his obligations under the law and just plain didn’t do it, you could get three times your security deposit back,” Perry said.</p>\n<p>Spencer Brandt, a third-year history of public policy major and I.V. Community Services District (CSD) board member, said that landlords are often aware that their tenants are first-time renters and do not know their legal rights before renting in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Many of these [landlords] are large, out of town housing conglomerates who provide little-to-no customer service to their tenants,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD began discussions for the creation of a landlord-tenant mediation program last Tuesday but have yet to make a final decision.</p>\n<p>Renteria also condemned the actions of Del Playa Rentals owner James Gelb, who yelled homophobic slurs at I.V.

will cost approximately $5,000, according to Kim Equinoa, assistant dean for the Women’s Center.</p>\n<p>Contraceptives like the morning-after pill and general medical supplies like Band-Aids and pain relievers will be available at the vending machine.</p>\n<p>The products will be available to Isla Vistans and UCSB students, and the machine will display information about sexual health resources available on and off campus.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center plans to finalize the full list of vending machine products by the end of Fall Quarter, according to Diane Bell, pharmacist manager at Student Health. Bell said Student Health services will restock the vending machine when required.</p>\n<p>Students proposed the vending machine because they wanted access to health services beyond the hours of normal convenience and drug stores, Equinoa said.</p>\n<p>“We started researching different ways for producing this kind of service, and our students really carried it forward,” she said.</p>\n<p>Students will be able to use cash when purchasing the products.</p>\n<p>All of the items in the machine will be over-the-counter items that are also available at Student Health. The products will cost approximately the same as those offered at the Student Health pharmacy, Equinoa said.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to keep it a little limited to begin with and then expand over time as students let us know the kinds of things that they need,” Equinoa said.</p>\n<p>A.S. approved funding for the vending machine in spring of 2015 and allowed the allocated funds to carry through to the 2017-2018 school year.</p>\n<p>The Pardall Center also offers other A.S. services to I.V. community members, such as the A.S. Legal Resource Center and the A.S. I.V. Tenants Union.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center requires that the vending machine maintains specific temperature settings so the machine does not overheat and ruin the medication. Most medications are stored in locations at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center first proposed the project in 2015, but the idea has since grown into a collaboration between UCSB Student Health services, Associated Students (A.S.) and the center.</p>\n<p>Students will have access to the vending machine during the Pardall Center’s normal hours of operation: 8 a.m. to midnight on Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Friday, 10 a.m. to 7p.m. on Saturday and noon to midnight on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Women’s Center, located on the first floor of the UCSB Student Resource Building, is a department that specializes in providing resources for female students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Since its founding 40 years ago, the center has added resources for students who identify within the LGBTQ spectrum and non-traditional students, such as women who want to return to school after having children.</p>\n<p>This center also works closely with the UCSB Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) program, which deals with interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>Equinoa said she is looking forward to the vending machine’s opening in the winter and the opportunity to expand resources for students.</p>\n<p>“We’re just really excited to be able to continue providing services for students in this way and really hope to create greater access to resources for students through this project,” Equinoa said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 2, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2028.jpg?w=888\" alt=\"\" itemprop=\"image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/evelyn-spence/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Evelyn Spence</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Evelyn Spence harbors a great love for em dashes and runs on nothing but iced coffee, Jolly Ranchers and breaking news.
