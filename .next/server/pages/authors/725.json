Luckily for those fans that would’ve otherwise spent the consumerist holiday wallowing in a puddle of self-pity and loneliness, they received a gift from Yeezus himself.</p>\n<p>However, there was a slight catch. Access to the album could only be obtained through a subscription to Jay Z’s streaming service, Tidal. That being said, the demand for new Ye is undisputed. Overnight, Tidal went from struggling to stay afloat to number one in the app store solely due to the exclusivity. #FACTS</p>\n<p>But, what’s up with the name?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Last year, Mr. West began stirring the pot by releasing the album’s original name, <em>So Help Me God</em>. Shortly after, the title was changed to <em>SWISH</em>, which held strong until very recently when Kanye revealed a shift to <em>Waves</em>. The new name ignited a feud with Wiz Khalifa who believed Kanye stole the slang from imprisoned rapper Max B, curator of the term, “wavy” (publicity stunt, perhaps?). After wife Kim Kardashian conducted various Twitter polls about the three possible title choices, Kanye ultimately chose none of the above. Shocker.</p>\n<p>The meaning behind <em>The Life of Pablo</em> sparked the imaginations of many Twitter philosophers.</p>\n<p>Theories about the ever elusive “Pablo” went rampant, ranging from the notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar to Pablo Picasso, arguably the most influential artist of the 20th century. The latter is more likely when taking in account the lyric, “I feel like Pablo when I’m working on my shoes” and Kanye’s self-proclaimed title as one of the greatest artists of all time.</p>\n<p>However, new rumors stated that Kanye claimed Pablo is actually a reference to St. Paul (Pablo in Spanish) which fits the gospel tunes in “Ultralight Beam,” “Father Stretch My Hands,” his son’s own name and the allusions of Mary and Joseph in the revamped version of “Wolves.”</p>\n<p>Part of the genius of TLOP lies in its hectic release. Kanye gave his fans a front row seat to the makings of an album. It went from an obscure process that magically occurred behind closed doors to a play-by-play experience filled with raw, uncut footage.</p>\n<p>Before embarking on the journey of <em>The Life of Pablo</em>, one must bring their sense of humor because first and foremost, the album is ridiculous. From its multiple name changes and ever-changing track lists, label as a “gospel album,” parade of features and cockiness every step of the way, the purposeful outrageousness is clear.</p>\n<p>The goal is to be talked about. “Everyone gonna say something … I’d be worried if they said nothing”. And what better way to get people talking than with insults? In between poking fun at Rob for his weight and sexual endeavors and reminding Ray J that it doesn’t matter who “may have hit it first,” he also managed to (accidentally?) reignite a feud with Taylor Swift. But hey, who can blame the guy? He already admitted, “I don’t know what it is with females … I’m not too good with that shit.”</p>\n<p>However, the braggadocio humor in “Famous” and “Highlights” starkly contrasts the self-reflection in “Real Friends” and “30 Hours,” which represents Kanye’s game face in social circles as compared to his inner thoughts respectively. He also uses TLOP to reinforce the juxtaposition between the profane and the sacred that has come to identify most of his work. Hence, “pray for Paris, pray for the parents” transitions to “now if I fuck this model and she just bleached her asshole …” Granted, not his best lyrically, but the duality is important here.</p>\n<p>It’s bipolar and doesn’t always make sense. Just like humanity. Kanye’s sometimes flawed, but complete honesty makes TLOP so monumental. It reveals the good, bad and the ugly in humanity.</p>\n<p>And the constant revisions that occurred up until the minute the album was released were not hints of sloppiness, but rather the strokes of creative liberty and passion. Without Chance the Rapper’s last minute prodding to keep “Waves,” already a favorite track, the album would be missing a vital organ. The transition between “I Love Kanye” to “Waves” is so flawless that it makes you wonder how the song was passed up in the first place.</p>\n<p>But yes, overall the album is disjointed.</p>\n<p>Yes, it lacks cohesion.</p>\n<p>Yes, it lacks an overarching message.</p>\n<p>However, are those really problems? Since when did cohesiveness become a staple for artistic expression? Keep in mind that TLOP is coming from an artist who has already proven he is capable of impeccable mixing and mastering. He revolutionized a genre with every album he has put out. He already made his political statements clear. He even created “so many Kanyes.” Therefore, a lack of cohesion cannot be a mere mistake. It cannot be the effect of mediocre mixing. It must be intentional. It’s life.</p>\n<p><em>The Life of Pablo </em>takes you from church to the club to the cemetery. Kanye even manages to bring Frank Ocean out from hiding for this one. It is brilliant in its unpolished realness. So, now, it’s time to just “shut the fuck up and enjoy the greatness.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68435\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68435\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-19/artsweek-feels-like-pablo/","id":6798,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6797,6796,6795],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"TOKiMONSTA Wows SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tokimonsta_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tokimonsta_by-Riley-Esguerra-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The stage was set and waiting for world-renowned DJ TOKiMONSTA, to bring SOhO’s quaint, dimly lit room to life last Thursday night.

Soft background music created a tranquil ambiance while people freshened up their drinks, engaged in small talk and swayed along to the beat. It was the calm before the storm.</p>\n<p>The attendees of this sold-out show trickled in from every walk of life. Literally. Checkered Vans-wearing undergrads, oxford-sporting graduate students, laid-back locals in flip flops, and frequent club-goers in stilettos all made their marks on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>As the clock approached 9:00, individual groups of minglers quickly morphed into an antsy crowd in anticipation of the opening act. Thanks to SOhO’s intimate setting, dodging elbows to the face in hopes of securing artist visibility was a non-issue, unlike in most general admission venues. Any spot at SOhO is a good spot.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>So, 9:15 passed. Ok, no big deal. Artists run late all the time.</p>\n<p>Then 9:30 passed.</p>\n<p>By 9:45, the storm began to brew.</p>\n<p>The previously nonthreatening crowd became rambunctious. Drinks were spilled. Chatter was thunderous, and mile-high platform heels turned their owners into mere puddles on the floor.</p>\n<p>Finally, an hour later, Leikeli47 appeared sporting her signature mask and an unapologetic New York attitude. The instant she made her entrance, a surge of bone rattling bass vibrated the room so hard that it is a wonder SOhO still has a second floor. At this point in the night, the crowd was ready to respond to any stimulus, so when Leikeli47 demanded that everybody “clap [their] fucking hands,” you can bet everyone responded obediently regardless of how they felt about the performance. For example, even the middle-aged woman who so eloquently voiced her opinion by shouting, “This shit sucks!” could not resist bouncing along to the bass’s heavy beats.</p>\n<p>Leikeli47’s abrasive raps lacked substance overall, but her exceptionally repetitive and simplistic lyrics had the crowd chanting along to the previously unfamiliar songs. Therefore, although the New Yorker’s vibe was out of place in laid-back Santa Barbara, she did manage to temporarily satiate the small but mighty crowd’s unruly energy.</p>\n<p>Within minutes of the opening act’s departure, a petite girl, who was barely visible under the shadow of a wide brimmed black hat, took her place on the stage. With no introduction necessary, Jennifer Lee (alias TOKiMONSTA) kicked off the third show of her nationwide Fovere tour with a charged-up rendition of Lupe Fiasco’s “Kick Push,” to which the crowd went wild.</p>\n<p>Lee’s hypnotic visuals and pulsing, euphoric beats turned charming SOhO into an elated dance club complete with attendees busting out interpretive, jellyfish-like moves which mimicked Lee’s melodic whimsy. Who else creates a mix of “The Next Episode” and “Hypnotize,” then jumps a decade and transitions to Tinashe’s “2 On,” cuts to “Bitch Better Have My Money” and ends the rollercoaster montage with some Kendrick Lamar?</p>\n<p>While original remixes seemed to be the crowd favorites, die-hard fans like Jessica, a fourth-year UCSB sociology major, were most excited to hear tracks from TOKi’s older albums. However, judging by the lack of familiarity that many attendees had with TOKiMONSTA’s original songs like “Realla” and “Go With It,” one could assume that the majority of this crowd came curious to discover new music. They were not disappointed.</p>\n<p>Lee enjoyed her time on stage almost as much as her audience enjoyed her performance. In the middle of her set, TOKi smirked and addressed the crowd for the first time to say, “I hope you guys like this Spanish version of ‘Hotline Bling,’ because I personally think it’s better than the original.” She later toyed with the audience by pretending her set was over. After a chorus of encores, Lee ran back out and said, “Ok maybe one more.” That one more song turned into two more and then three more until she ended with a bass pounding remix of “Shabba” and “Bugatti” that tore the roof off of SOhO.</p>\n<p>Lee’s inherent charm and knack for mixing things, as she puts it, “that are really chill and really angry and obscure” turned everyone into a fan of the “bunny monster” by the end of the night. Plus, she gets extra points for playing some Spanish Drake.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was a very well spent Thursday night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66652\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66652\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-19/tokimonsta-wows-soho/","id":6859,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6858,6857,6856],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Brainfeeder Artist TOKiMONSTA To Perform at SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tokimonsta.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tokimonsta.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Halloween may be over, but watch out because the TOKiMONSTA is coming to town.

She explains it as, “You have ‘toki,’ which is Korean for a rabbit—something sweet and innocent—combined with a ‘monster,’ and it explains the mentality behind my music. I have this yin and yang mentality where I like things that are really chill, and I like things that are really angry and obscure.”</p>\n<p>Lee discovered her passion for composing music in college. She attended UC Irvine to study business, but ended up making beats. Lee then participated in the prestigious Red Bull Music Academy in London in 2010, and by 2012, she was touring with the likes of Skrillex, Diplo, Pretty Lights and Grimes. Some notable performances include Coachella, Electric Zoo, Sonar Barcelona and Sasquatch.</p>\n<p>Lee’s unique take on EDM, hip hop, and everything in between led her to release two full albums, multiple EPs and vinyl-only singles through highly regarded labels including Ultra Records and Ninja Tune, and she has also become the first lady of Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder imprint.</p>\n<p>If you’re already familiar with TOKiMONSTA, then you understand why LA Weekly ranked her as LA’s best female DJ and noted her versatility as a producer. Her classical training and widely diverse music taste allow her to create melodies that take you on a journey. The boundless, textural soundscapes of her songs sweep you up, spin you around, and then unapologetically drop you in a newfound realm of music. While TOKi’s needle-pushing music stands on its own, her work with artists including Tinashe, Schoolboy Q, Miguel and Jesse Boykins III also showcase the demand for her productions and remixes.</p>\n<p>Since TOKiMONSTA refuses to box herself in to a single genre of music, her show will feature a little something for everyone through original tunes and new remixes. Lee aims for her sets to approximate “orchestrating live music,” which makes every performance exciting and unique.</p>\n<p>Lee fights against the current of repetitiveness that is prevalent in mainstream music today and marches to the beat of her own drum (or synthesizer) while continuing to please audiences on the dance floor time and time again.</p>\n<p>After all the pressure of midterms and life in general, there is no better way to release those stressful juices than through a night of dancing and musical therapy, so mark your calendars for Thursday, Nov. 12 and get your tickets to TOKiMONSTA. You won’t be disappointed.</p>\n<p>Lee’s instinct for melodic whimsy.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3kQHZmQmVI</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66283\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66283\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-09/brainfeeder-artist-tokimonsta-to-perform-at-soho/","id":6932,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6931,6930,6929],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Treasure Island Music Fest Returns for Another Successful Year","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/treasureislanddn102115.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/treasureislanddn102115.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Treasure Island Music Festival feels a lot like Lewis Carroll’s Wonderland, minus the psychedelia, plus The National.

Noise Pop and Another Planet Entertainment truly designed this festival with the attendee in mind. Shuttles that run all day made travel to and from the island a breeze. Two stages situated right across from each other made maneuvering between acts quick and painless. Non-conflicting set times meant that festival-goers could show up just 10 minutes before their favorite artist’s set time and still get front row.</p>\n<p>Oh, and forget dodging elbows to the face and feeling packed like a sardine. The TIMF crowd actually respects personal space and the “first come, first served” rule. Of course, the occasional muscle-teed and snapback-capped gent may have tried to muscle through the crowd. However, TIMF’s infrequency of the aforementioned demographic makes this festival a walk in the park compared to the usual death match Coachella crowds can devolve into.</p>\n<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a San Francisco music festival without some good eats. In fact, Bay Area local Robyn Green said that her family’s goal was to “eat at every food stand here.” That is a noble goal indeed, Mrs. Green. The tea party included paella, chocolate-covered bacon, coca-cola braised pork sandwiches and acai bowls. Perhaps the best way to enjoy this delicious food was at the comedy tent where one could see Lauren Lapkus (“Orange Is the New Black” and “Jurassic World”) performing improv or Jerrod Carmichael (“Neighbors”) doing some standup. Silent Frisco’s Silent Disco party served as the best calorie burner, where hoards of people simultaneously performed interpretive dance. But now, on to the music.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Dressed in Hawaiian shirts and shorts, Viceroy kicked off the festival with a beach party. With the support of electric fiddles, saxophones and bongos, Viceroy remixed quite a few Top 40 tracks. The crowd responded positively.</p>\n<p>Later on, Run the Jewels graced the Bridge stage with an electrifying performance. They ran out to a rendition of Queen’s “We Are the Champions,” and Killer Mike instantly let the crowd know of his intention to “burn the stage to the fucking ground.” And so they did by spewing vocal fire all over the Bridge. As if RtJ needed to win the crowd over even more, the duo sealed the deal when they took a moment to thank Steph Curry for using one of their songs in a commercial and paid their respects to the late, great Mac Dre.</p>\n<p>Cashmere Cat’s soothing sunset performance was the perfect antidote to the RtJ-induced energy. The Norwegian DJ delivered a performance with a perfect balance of dreamlike melodies and euphoric, dancy vibes that set the tone for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most anticipated performance of the weekend was the debut of Big Grams. This surprising pair, consisting of Outkast’s Big Boi and electronic duo Phantogram, was definitely a treasure at Treasure Island, or as Big Boi put it, “We come together like butt cheeks.” Big Boi even gave the crowd a treat by going back to his roots and offering up a sing-along of Outkast’s “Ms. Jackson.”</p>\n<p>At this point in the night, temperatures fell quite low and the biting breeze of the bay began to leave its sting. It was appropriate then that deadmau5 was fashionably late. Twenty minutes later, just the lighting of The Dome was enough to send the audience in a frenzy, and long interludes into favorites like “Ghosts N Stuff” and “The Veldt” sustained them. Pulsing beats combined with hypnotizing visuals transported the crowd into the brilliant mind of Joel Zimmerman for 90 minutes. Deadmau5’s set was much more than a performance; it was an experience.</p>\n<p>Coming off the high that was day one, day two fell a bit flat.</p>\n<p>If day one was a dancer’s paradise, day two was a lazy Sunday afternoon in a coffee shop which, for the most part, fit the lineup. An appearance from Karl the Fog definitely added to the mood as well. As Jose Gonzalez gracefully strummed away on his guitar, attendees meditated, practiced yoga and had picnics on the lawn.</p>\n<p>Father John Misty did what most performers of the day failed to do: offer a heartfelt performance. In between poking fun at the videographers and joking about the necessity of a man bun due to the high winds, Father John Misty belted out songs so beautifully, you had to hold your “honeybear” … or wish you had one.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Deerhunter failed to elicit any emotion from the audience. Lead singer Bradford Cox even commented that “it sounds like a library out there.” However, this comment seemed like more of a dig at his own band since it takes a lot to shut a Bay Area crowd up.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Chvrches picked the pace right back up and unleashed the crowd’s full potential. Even though lead singer Lauren Mayberry apologized for the wind messing with her vocals and giving her “hairballs,” she did not miss a single note. The synth-pop trio’s charm drew one of the biggest crowds of the weekend.</p>\n<p>The National closed out this wonderful festival in style by bringing out Chvrches’ own Mayberry. She joined in on a duet of “I Need My Girl” with Matt Berninger in a live performance even better than the original. Proving that they get better with age, The National delivered a delightful performance and defended their legitimacy as a festival headliner.</p>\n<p>This festival had it all: diversity, spontaneity, you name it. With a little luck, one may even spot a few Jack Sparrows running around. And maybe, just maybe, if you wear a shark costume, deadmau5 will pull you up on stage. Anything is possible at Treasure Island.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65654\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65654\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-22/treasure-island-music-fest-returns-for-another-successful-year/","id":6904,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[6903,6902,6901],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"American Horror Story: The Hotel Premier","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lady-gaga-ahs-hotel.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/lady-gaga-ahs-hotel.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Just when I thought Lady Gaga couldn’t get stranger, she became a soul-sucking seductress.

But I think I liked it? American Horror Story is back in its 5th season with “Hotel.” If I had to describe this premiere in just a few words, they would be clichés, blood and clichés. However, would it really be an American horror story without some low IQ damsels, bad choices, demon children and vampires? Probably not. So, on we go.</p>\n<p>The show begins with a fish-eye lens (because nothing screams terror like a good fish-eye) of two hot blonde tourists checking into the Hotel Cortez in L.A. We’re introduced to the receptionist, Iris (Kathy Bates), who refers to the girls as “Swedish meatballs“ and lets them know the hotel is a “dead zone.” No WiFi. No cell service. Of course. As they walk to their room, we meet the housekeeper who is getting blood stains out of bed sheets due to a “terrible accident.” The Swedish meatballs are less than impressed with their room as it has a vile odor. Lo and behold, the stench came from a halfway decomposed person-thing that crawls out of the stitched up mattress and sends the girls running back to Iris. Monsters under the bed, for sure. She provides them with a new room, the ever elusive room 64. Dun dun dunnnnnn. While there, the tourists get attacked by tiny children with a thirst for blood.</p>\n<p>Scene change. Now, we’re assaulted with a gory, blatantly disgusting crime scene. It includes cut out eyes and tongues put in bowls, and a couple on a bed. Oh, did I forget to mention that the girl is speared to the headboard while the guy, blind and tongueless, is barely alive with his man part still inside her? I’m no newbie to the gore of AHS, but this was a bit much for my liking. Here, we meet Detective John Lowe (Wes Bentley) who is investigating the crime. When he gets back to his office, he gets a call from an ominous voice who says that they’re going to repeat the gruesome crime again in none other than room 64. Serial killer? Most likely.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Now we’re back at the hotel where a male junkie is looking for a room, and, surprise surprise, he gets room 64. As he begins doing the things that junkies do, he gets an unpleasant surprise from a mummified being with a very sharp, very dangerous strap-on. Sally (Sarah Paulson), a heroin addict and resident of the hotel, seems to appear from thin air and tells the man that if he wants the pain to stop, he just has to say, “I love you, Sally.” Once he obliges, he immediately dies. Love hurts, my dears.</p>\n<p>Moments later, Detective Lowe arrives at the hotel and demands to go into room 64. He’s escorted by Liz Taylor (cross dressed Denis O’Hare) who I can already tell is going to be one of the favorites this season. Once the Detective checks the room, nothing seems to be out of place, but the Detective seems to recognize a child running around in the halls.</p>\n<p>Finally, The Countess (Lady Gaga) is introduced. Little is known about her other than that she owns the hotel and has a thirst for human blood. Oh, and she has a killer wardrobe. The Countess and Donovan (Matt Bomer) are in some sort of relationship where they seduce couples and kill them afterward. Of course, because this is AHS, you can expect a soft-core porn scene that ends with The Countess and Donovan swimming in a literal pool of blood. Though I must say, it was a beautifully shot scene.</p>\n<p>As if there wasn’t enough confusion about the plotline already, we meet famous fashion designer, Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson) and his son who are (of course) wanting to buy the hotel. The Countess leads Drake’s son through a secret passage way revealing the ultimate kid-fantasy room. What could be so bad about that? Nothing much, except one of the vampire kids is actually the Detective’s missing son. If that wasn’t a big enough bomb to drop, get this: Donovan is actually Iris’s son who overdosed on heroin with Sally, so Iris pushed Sally out of the top floor of the hotel where she met her death on the pavement. %*^#*^%$!!!</p>\n<p>The episode ends with Lowe checking into room 64 as his investigation for the killer begins. Meanwhile, “Hotel California” plays in the background (ha ha).</p>\n<p>Phew. That was a lot to cover.</p>\n<p>I’m still disappointed about Jessica Lange’s departure and the flop of season four, but AHS is back, gorier and more enticing than ever. This premiere definitely held nothing back, and it left SO many questions. Is everyone a ghost or just Sally? Why is The Countess a vampire? Who’s the killer? What’s up with the Detective’s son?</p>\n<p>Only one thing is known: “You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65353\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65353\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-14/american-horror-story-the-hotel-premier/","id":5920,"author":{"id":725,"name":"Carla Cernat"},"related":[5919,5918,5917],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/725"}},"__N_SSG":true}
