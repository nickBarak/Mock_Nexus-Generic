The Associated Students Womxn’s Commission hosted the event.</p>\n<p>Ilene Ochoa, a fourth-year sociology major and senate liaison to the Womxn’s Commission, said the event was important for womxn of color in the present political climate.</p>\n<p>“The board liked the idea of rising from the ashes, being reborn like a phoenix, because even though you’ve gone through hardships, you still come out strong,” Ochoa said in an email.</p>\n<p>Zahira Kelly-Cabrera, an Afro-Dominicana writer, artist and international speaker, kicked off the event with a compelling speech about being an Afro-Latina.</p>\n<p>Kelly-Cabrera talked about her struggles with self-identity and with being marginalized even within her own Latinx community. She told a story of resilience amidst the hate she received from individuals who disapproved of her voicing self-acceptance as a womxn of color.</p>\n<p>She also discussed self-growth and resistance despite her experiences of toxic relationships and feeling like she did not belong to any community.</p>\n<p>Many attendees considered the speaker a highlight of the conference.</p>\n<p>“I enjoyed the keynote speaker [because] the space was intimate and powerful when she was sharing her story,” Ochoa said.</p>\n<p>Two workshop sessions succeeded Kelly-Cabrera.</p>\n<p>Sessions A and B featured various workshops focusing on topics such as mental health healing and effectively using radio as a platform for womxn of color to make their voices heard.</p>\n<p>Deborah Williams, a second-year political science major, attended a workshop called “Revolutionary Motherhood And Growing Up In The Movement: Two Generations Of Transnational Feminists.”</p>\n<p>“I got a better understanding of women’s roles and how they are changing today and how my mothers and grandmothers role differ from how I’m going to pursue my role as a mother,” Williams said. “I am going to foster that new generation with male and female equality.”</p>\n<p>KCSB-FM’s Radio Xicana host, Cecilia, lead the workshop called “Navigating the AirWaves: Muxeres en Radio.”</p>\n<p>She said her passion for the workshop stemmed from exploring the construct of identity through a more authentic platform in comparison to media representation.</p>\n<p>Hour-long caucus spaces, which are safe spaces for different identifications to bond over shared experiences, followed the sessions.</p>\n<p>Adena Badawi, an attendee from Orange County, explained the importance behind the caucuses.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it’s really important for womxn of color to have an outlet where we can all come together and share our experiences and form connections, and I’ve definitely accomplished that today through all the great people like me that I’ve met,” said Badawi.</p>\n<p>Attendees expanded on why the Womxn of Color Conference plays a key role in the fight for equality.</p>\n<p>Williams added that it was vital for college campuses to raise awareness and encourage participation in events such as this.</p>\n<p>“I think by coming to these conferences, I’m able to see more people like myself and relate to their experiences,” Samantha Mejia, a second-year sociology major, said.</p>\n<p>Maria Gonzales, a second-year global studies major, discussed the role that the Womxn of Color Conference plays on campus.</p>\n<p>Gonzales explained that UCSB has a lack of safe spaces for students of color on campus and said students of color often do not feel a sense of belonging in higher institutions.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of attendees were minority womxn, a few allies attended in order to show their support, get educated and gain perspective.</p>\n<p>“Men don’t support womxn very well so I feel like I need to step up and be an example to other men, and I need to learn how to do that properly,” Fred Atef, a visitor from Orange County, said.</p>\n<p>The Womxn’s Commission considered the day as a success, and Ochoa said that the event re-motivated her to continue her work as a political activism.</p>\n<p>“I see how important this work is in our community and how it can empower other womxn of color,” Ochoa said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

passed on Jan. 24 in support of mentally disabled students in on-campus housing.</p>\n<p>The meeting was held by Senators Alison Sir and Anthony Pimentel and concluded with a plan to continue the discussion with university administrators and Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.)</p>\n<p>Sir read off an anonymous testimony from a student who removed from university housing due to a mental disability.</p>\n<p>“When I met with Housing and Judicial Affairs, they said I was banned because I violated the Personal Care Clause and my agreement, even though it was due to my mental illness,” Sir read from the testimony.</p>\n<p>The meeting began with a public forum to allow students of the UC Santa Barbara community to voice their concerns.</p>\n<p>“I know a lot of people who have had to go to Tropicana because of this clause and I’m here to say that as a personal representative of the RHA Coordinating Board, I’m just here to support you guys,” said Kevin Sabellico, San Rafael Hall Council Co-President.</p>\n<p>Daniel Renteria, Chair of the Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU), added that he needs to “make sure this is an appropriate goal for IVTU to be a part of.”</p>\n<p>In the approved plan of action, senators will split into three groups to collect information regarding the “Personal Care Clause” to present at a Town Hall meeting with the UCSB community in two weeks, according to Pimentel.</p>\n<p>Three senators will meet with Housing and Residential Services, a second group will meet with C.A.P.S., and a third group will meet with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80789\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80789\"

referencing to the vague justifications used to remove students from Housing.</p>\n<p>During their meeting with C.A.P.S., the senators plan to discuss the training provided to Residential Life staff on handling mental health issues and C.A.P.S.’s role in helping students who may struggle with mental illness, according to Sir.</p>\n<p>The council also plans to gather and release testimonies from students who attend C.A.P.S. for review and potential policy changes.</p>\n<p>Sir clarified that their intentions are not to discourage students from using C.A.P.S., calling it a “great student resource” that simply needs improvement.</p>\n<p>Pimentel said Senators speaking with administration plan to gather information on UCSB’s involvement in dealing with these issues.</p>\n<p>“I felt like it was a very productive and efficient meeting that allowed Alison and myself to hear the public’s thoughts and perspectives about this issue and allowed us to direct the Committee members onto the

Building on Saturday, providing a space to discuss what it means to be a minority womxn and promote self love . <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Associated Students’ Womxn’s Commission will be hosting its annual Womxn of Color Conference this Saturday, Feb. 3, honoring self-identifying women of color while bringing awareness to their intersectional struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conference will be composed of workshops, speakers and free meals and it will last from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Workshops will address issues such as navigating what it means to be a minority womxn and promoting self-love.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will be the conference’s sixth consecutive year at UCSB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zahira Kelly-Cabrera, an AfroDominicana writer, artist and international speaker, will kick off the conference by speaking about white-supremacist capitalist heteropatriarchy and what it means to minority women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly-Cabrera is an award-winning sociocultural critic who specifically focuses on the AfroLatina sector of intersectional feminism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her work has been featured in publications such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmopolitan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Kelly-Cabrera has also held lectures and panels at universities such as New York University and has hosted a TEDx talk in Mexico. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Members of the Womxn’s Commission executive board anticipate that her appearance will be a noteworthy way to begin the conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our keynote speaker is a badass, and I’m sure after hearing her speak we will all be pumped up and ready to get the day started,” third-year political science and art double major Siboney Arias, a Herstorian on the board, said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kelly-Cabrera’s speech will be followed by two workshop sessions and a caucus space. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Session A and B will each have nine workshops that cater to every self-identifying attendees through specialized topics, including self-love/care, white supremacy and intercultural struggles of colored women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other workshops are aimed at building skill through career identity and vision building, such as the “Discovering my Career Identity” workshop, presented by a speaker named Monique. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KCSB will be also be hosting its own “Herstories” through a music workshop, during which Radio Xicana will give tips on how to use the radio as a platform for women of color.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“People should look forward to meeting some powerful and strong womxn that take shit from no one. They should look forward to learning about different issues that they aren’t familiar with,” Arias said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caucus spaces will succeed the workshops and serve as a time to debrief and intermingle with individuals of shared identities, according to Arias.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many workshops are open to all, but some spaces specify the identifications they are open to. The Womxn of Color Conference website explains the status of each event.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Womxns’ Commission reminds interested individuals to register online to ensure plenty of food and t-shirts for everyone. Attendees will be provided breakfast, lunch and dinner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I am passionate about creating spaces for people to learn, grow, and feel safe. It’s very important to me to have people feel like they can be themselves, without feeling societies stigmas, so that was what I aimed for in this conference,” Arias said in an email.</span></p><div

as the new ED for IVYP,” Goodman said in an email. “I strongly believe that investing in children, providing them with all [they] need to learn, to be emotionally secure and to be successful is the best investment we can make as a society.”</p>\n<p>Goodman’s assignment will begin Jan. 28, following the retirement of Executive Director LuAnn Miller after 30 years of work. The organization itself was founded in 1971 by community members after riotous protests that resulted in the burning of the Bank of America in I.V.</p>\n<p>Goodman said that she wants to expand on Miller’s legacy. She described Miller as an “authentic, caring and competent leader” who grew the IVYP “from a small child care center to the diverse and impactful organization it is today.”</p>\n<p>Goodman’s optimism reflects her passion for the program. She said that her main goal currently is to learn everything about the IVYP, from her duties to the people, programs and partners that surround the agency.</p>\n<p>She explained that one of the major challenges she expects to face during her first few months is funding, as with many nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p>“Most of IVYP’s budget comes through the California State Department of Education,” she said. “I have a lot to learn about how that funding works, but my experience with governmental funding is that it rarely pays enough to provide the salary and benefits that teachers deserve.”</p>\n<p>She also described IVYP’s relationship to UCSB as “unique” especially as an increase in UCSB admission rates will affect housing in I.V.</p>\n<p>“As UCSB moves forward in its plan to enroll more students, that will likely impact housing and services in Isla Vista. Anticipating those changes and ensuring that children and families are not forgotten will be part of my agenda,” she said.</p>\n<p>In the future, she wants to focus on spreading awareness about IVYP and its comprehensive role both in and out of the community.</p>\n<p>“More people should know what we’re doing. We serve children and families in I.V. and Goleta, but our leadership can and should be recognized far and wide,” she said.</p>\n<p>As Miller prepares to conclude her long career at IVYP, she remains grateful for the ability to have genuinely enjoyed every day of work over a span of 33 years. She began at IVYP as a teacher and assumed the role of executive director a year later.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been blessed with the perfect intersection of education, skill set, passion and faith: the ability to do meaningful work to make a difference in our community,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>The next stages in Miller’s life include plans for traveling, cooking, focusing on her health and enjoying time with her husband.</p>\n<p>“I hope I will be remembered as someone who led with heart and head,” she said. “Someone who believed that all the children and families deserve equal access to education, safety, health and respect… someone who truly enjoyed the energy, vibrancy and goodness in Isla Vista that is often missed up those outside the community.”</p>\n<p>Miller hopes that Goodman will fall in love with IVYP.</p>\n<p>“At IVYP, we are working to address the root causes of so many societal problems. When we have strong, whole children and families, our community thrives. What could be more important than that?” Goodman said.</p>\n<p>Goodman is also no stranger to community service. She previously worked at Child Abuse Listening &amp; Mediation (C.A.L.M.), where she served as chief development officer and as a member of the senior management team.</p>\n<p>She has also previously worked as a camp counselor, program director, day care monitor, teacherand youth group advisor.</p>\n<p>Goodman has a deep connection with the I.V. community through her tight-knit family. Her son attends UCSB and her husband, Rabbi Evan Goodman, serves the campus through Santa Barbara Hillel. With the new gig, Goodman joked, she can now meet with her spouse for lunch at Freebirds.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Jan. 25 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-80642\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-80642\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ivyp-welcomes-new-director-after-three-month-search-process/","id":4337,"author":{"id":207,"name":"Jasmine Moreno"},"related":[4336,4335,4334],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/207"}},"__N_SSG":true}
