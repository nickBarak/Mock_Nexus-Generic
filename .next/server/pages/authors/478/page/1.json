I’m not sure if I read that from a Snapple fact or if I just made that up. But anyway, I didn’t believe it at first, until I started listening to half the shit I say. And turns out, it’s probably right. And I’m likely above average.</p>\n<p>Sometimes lying is fun, but almost always, lying makes you seem a hell of a lot cooler than you really are. Well, that is, until you get caught.</p>\n<p>1. The Athlete: Everyone loves an athlete. It’s a completely forgivable category. You can be a douchebag, closet weirdo or have the IQ of a donkey, but as long as you have the jersey, you’re a fuckin’ stud. But even if you have the makeup of an athlete (chiseled bod, that stupid ass arrogance for no reason at all and excessive grab-ass behavior — regardless of gender), you’ve got nothin’ if you peaked in high school. So while you’re talkin’ to Miss Dick-Sucking-Lips on the couch, you might have to throw a curveball. “Yeah, I’m on the basketball team, it’s really no big deal.” And as she scoots close enough to you to potentially perform a ballcuzi, you choke. “I mean, I’m on the I.M. team, but it’s cool. We won our bracket. You’re still going home with me, right?” Don’t be surprised if she retaliates with, “Let’s put it this way, does a priest make a good babysitter?” (Sorry, too close to Easter; brb going to hell.)</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>2. The Virgin: Although it’s hard to believe that a) this rare breed exists in Isla Vista and b) they’d be willing to give it up the same night that they met you, you can’t beat this one if you play it off right. Disclaimer: If you don’t, you’ll end up beating it yourself. Meeting a virgin is like entering into the apocalypse. No matter how much you think you’re prepared, you’re still fucked. Wading through the excitement and ego boost, you all of a sudden land on the holy shit freak out that this person is about to remember you forever. But, then, of course, once you’re actually in bed, they start bending like a yoga teacher, hanging upside down from their sex swing, throwing out moves you’ve only seen on T.V. programs. And I’m talkin’ the expensive ones.</p>\n<p>3. The Writer: This one has so many different angles to work with. If you’re a guy, you look sentimental and smart, and if you’re a girl, well, likely you’re smart enough to steal my thunder and play off that you’re Elizabeth Brooks. Clothes come off, and if you’re real wild, sheets may come off too, and then all of a sudden you’re like, “Fuck. What did I just get myself into here? Did I just inadvertently sign up for a Dirty Sanchez? I should’ve done my research on my fake job. Shit.” Well, word to the wise, be prepared for my new favorite question, “Oh my God, are you going to write about this?” Why, yes. Yes I am. It’s on like Groupon.</p>\n<p>4. The Slayer: There’s a fine line between creepy and crafty. Make enough sexual innuendos: crafty. Walk into Jack in the Box in the nude and throw open your robe: creepy. But sometimes, if your little innuendos come off too strong, you might as well start investing in a cheap cotton robe. Talking a big game is lying’s sneaky, twatty sister that no one invited. If you have no intention of following through, you’re just a classic cock-tease, or, you’re in too deep. While you’re jammin’ at a party to “Club Can’t Handle Me” (because enough time has passed for it to be okay to get excited about this song again), you might want to hold back on the, “Yeah, well, if the club can’t handle you, I bet your bottom fuckin’ dollar my hotel room can,” unless you have Gold Cab’s number on speed dial. It comes down to two choices: run, or rail and bail. If you’re gonna lie, you gotta commit.</p>\n<p>5. The Magician: This is one you don’t see very often, unless you’re into David Blaine — or some magical panty dropper effect that I’m unaware of — but mostly just David Blaine. And while it seems far-fetched, and probably some level of just plain uncool to pretend to be a magician, think about what it would be like to encounter one. You’d start out like, “Yeah, sweet, other than pulling a Houdini and blowing a load in a girl’s face, what other little ‘magic’ do you have?” But what if they were a real magician? You might find out what the fuck actually happens when they saw someone in half. Think of all of the secrets you would finally have answers to! Maybe you could join in on one of the acts, hit the road and end up in Vegas. Oh, the possibilities. Just make sure you at least have the abraca-chicken one down before you go big.</p>\n<p>Deceiving someone to get them into bed is just plain cruel. But “I love you,” “I’ll pull out” or “I’m on the pill” are all a little too overused to be taken seriously. So get creative. It may be bad, but hey, it’s fun to do bad things.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46226\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46226\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-18/lie-times/","id":6391,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6390,6389,6388],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Roommate Double-Double: Careful Where That Appetite Takes You","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Logic is the devil of language.

Because it would make perfect sense for you to fall in love with your hookup’s roommate. Talk about a classic mix-up.</p>\n<p>Have you ever woken up after a night of (self-proclaimed) “slay city” and looked across the room only to find the most beautiful Lamb of God imaginable lying in the other bed? I know what you’re thinking in that situation, and I’m right there with ya. Yeah, shit son, you went for the wrong roommate. Now? Welcome to the hardest phase of time management you’ll face in your entire college career: swiftly making the transition from roommate number one to roommate number two.</p>\n<p>Upon first meeting each other, you and roommate number two overlook the, “Duhhhhhh, what’s your major?” bullshit, because you very clearly can’t have each other. Cordial schmordial. But, regardless, there’s instant attraction, and before you know it, outta nowhere, it turns into need it, want it, gotta have it. The attraction is mutual, because hello, it makes perfect sense. It’s like solving a Rubik’s Cube — shit finally lines up and then you suddenly can’t suppress the desire to completely fuck it up again.

Because, inevitably, you’ll get caught. It’s always this drawn-out, painfully elaborate process that starts out innocently with roommate number one coming over to your house and asking where you bought these “specialty” condoms. Your casual reply of “Pshh, I bought them” is the last nail in the coffin. Turns out they’re these super fuckin’ rare, can-only-get-them-in-China, heavy-duty, keep-the-babies-AWAY condoms. To which you try to immediately recover with, “Uh, ya. Haha. Ha. Funny story, true story, actually, they started selling them at I.V. Market, who knew right? WHO KNEW?”</p>\n<p>But I mean, once things start moving past the classic OTPHJ (over the pants hand job) stage, it starts becoming, “Listen, my roommate is in class, get your ass over here, NOW.” And then you’re free to bang, and not just bang, puhlease. Forget hearing your standard cup caking through the wall. Ha, child’s play. We’re talking hearing-long-distance-headboard-banging-against-the-wall status. Heyo, ‘sup world.</p>\n<p>You think you’re so suave in keeping it on the major down low. But then shit starts getting all kinds of uncomfortable. In front of roommate number one, you casually mention to roommate number two that they should “draw you,” and it’s like, “Oh, God, not actually. I meant the app!” But even Draw Something wants you to be together. Every three coin word is soulmate … or marriage … or skeeball … okay that was a wild card, but all you want is that goddamn neon color package, so you have to pick them. God. Life is hard.</p>\n<p>And then, despite all this, roommate number one is still way too confident in the hookup relationship, because they somehow remain incredibly oblivious, when everyone at UCSB (including Chancellor Yang) has caught onto what is going on. So number one starts shit-talking to number two. “Hey, bro, I’m wearing Velcro shoes and still getting laid while you go home and beat it tonight.” And all the while, roomie number two is thinking, “Uh, yeah, to the nudes your girlfriend sent me last night. Yeah, yeah, later bro.”</p>\n<p>Then, when all three of you are in public together, the two of you secret lovahs get close enough to start passionately making out, but end up high-fiving instead. ‘Cause as much as you want to finally expose the relationship, it’s like, what are you supposed to say at this point? “I accidentally slipped it in?” Yeah, and I “accidentally” parked my car in my neighbor’s garage … claaaassic me.</p>\n<p>But the real turning point is when they start to make you think all kinds of crazy shit. Like, woah, I would even watch American Idol for this person. Holy shit, I might even go so far as to pick a favorite and start arguing with the judges. No. No way, this is not real life.</p>\n<p>Once that happens, you’re done for. You’ve committed and that only means that roommate number one is bound to walk into your classic afternoon delight sesh.

They are not out at Sweet Alley gorging themselves on bin candy (Lies, I already blew our cover there; sorry). But no, mostly they are walking around promoting the fact that Valentine’s Day is “a stupid Hallmark holiday,” and let’s face it, singles are way too hipster for that shit. It’s a very Ryan Gosling-esque way of thinking (wait, he has a girlfriend?! SHIT!).</p>\n<p>But during that pivotal moment when people start thinking, “Whatever, let’s just throw a fuckin’ party; it IS a holiday after all,” the singles inevitably end up scrolling through their phonebooks. Even if guys don’t care about Valentine’s Day, no one really wants to be alone for it.</p>\n<p>I mean, yes, singles are alone, and it’s no different than any other day, really. Well, minus the goddamn flower/balloon/chocolate mash-up on the kitchen table your roommate waltzed in with that looks like an episode of “The Bachelor” threw up its rose ceremony everywhere. (By the way, Courtney sucks.) But do we have to be reminded, especially when the people in a relationship get to the point (usually after a sugar high or wine binge) where they try to empathize with their single friends? Totally unprovoked, they’ll throw out, “Yeah, it’s a stupid holiday, because when you’re in love shouldn’t every day be Valentine’s Day?” That’s cute when you’re in a relationship, but when you’re not, all of the bitter singles will politely ask you to please go suck a fuck.</p>\n<p>Really, though, couples don’t go particularly ape-shit over this holiday either. With Valentine’s Day, no matter what you do, it’s hard to win. You do nothing: fail. You do something, but it’s not over-the-top enough: fail. Or you do something that’s over the top and it’s “too much.” Fail. It’s too much pressure. It’s like an unexpected extra birthday party you don’t particularly feel like dropping your entire fucking day and planning for. And in the middle of the week? In the middle of the QUARTER?! Get real. I have a 246-page reader to finish before my midterm tomorrow. Love you tons, smoochietoons, but I’m knee deep in Robinson Crusoe, xoxo! “Gossip Girl.” Sorry, had to.</p>\n<p>My real fave, though, is the vanishing act. This typically happens with a fuck buddy that’s been around for a significant amount of time. This is when one person in the relationship just completely avoids the day altogether. If you got the text today that read: “Hey! What’s up, sorry I was super busy yesterday. How was your day?” please let him or her know that they are not fooling anyone. Sly move, but if you even did SOMETHING you would’ve gotten an after-school lay. Is there anything better than that? Well yeah, sure, probably, but a between classes, between the sheets session is pretty tough to beat.</p>\n<p>Ooh, here’s a fun little side note. As much as girls deny that it’s prostitution when we’re screwing you because you spent 12 bucks on a teddy bear, we’re fully aware of the situation, and if you’re lucky, we will thank you as we see fit. Not necessarily the bigger the bear, the bigger the bone. But, the thought does count.</p>\n<p>Personally? I dig Valentine’s Day, because I can drink a cosmo without having to feel like I’m being too high-maintenance. I even bought myself three pairs of shoes and actually got away with it this week. I didn’t go as far as sending myself flowers (God no! I’m not that pathetic), but the edible fruit arrangement really did provide just the right touch.</p>\n<p>See, Valentine’s Day doesn’t suck that bad. I’d probably stop complaining about it altogether if we got school off for a full day slay-athon. Sigh. Wishful thinking. Welp, there’s always Presidents’ Day to look forward to! ;)</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks is lying: she never needs an excuse to drink a cosmo.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44638\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44638\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-15/dont-give-fuck-youre-fucked-difficult/","id":6418,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6417,6416,6415],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“I’m Rooting for Peyton Manning”","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Watching the Super Bowl for girls is like watching the WNBA … for anyone.

Luckily, the real halftime show coincided with the kitty halftime show of the Puppy Bowl, which was far more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>The one and only time I perked up was when they actually did cut to Gisele in the audience. Because let’s be real, if I wanted to watch a bunch of fat men running around in tights, I’d just go to an American Apparel in Houston. But of course I had to do my duty and cheer on Tom Brady, because the chances of me being able to name any other guy out on that field are about as close to the chances of me giving up alcohol for Lent. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>\n<p>Speaking of alcohol, the Super Bowl turns classy ladies into self-proclaimed frat stars. Keg stands? Gargoyles? Shotgunning? Bring it. By the end of the first half I’m pretty sure I was opening bottles with my forearm. God no, that was a boldfaced lie. Could you imagine? But thanks to midday mass alcoholic consumption, it was kind of difficult to get on board with looking sexy when the Super Bowl ended. “No, no, my eyes always look like this, I’m not even that drunk. Not even that drunk.”</p>\n<p>The one good thing about the Super Bowl is that everyone can bond over the commercials. Except for when Adriana Lima came on for the Victoria’s Secret Valentine’s Day commercial and every guy in the room had to maneuver their seating arrangement to conceal a half-master. Same result anywhere you go after that commercial comes on. The girls in the room start debating whether or not her boobs are real, and the guys are sitting there in awe, shaking their heads, saying, “Doesn’t matter. Does not matter.”</p>\n<p>Well, to be real, the Super Bowl wasn’t all that bad. The last 10 minutes were intense. I’m talking in tents. It almost made me want to learn the rules of the game. When the Giants finally sealed their win, it all of a sudden was déjà vu back to New Year’s. Screaming, yelling, bottles opening. It was out of control. Giants couples everywhere were most likely making out euphorically, and Patriot pair-ups were consoling each other with love. The Super Bowl can really bring people together, and look at that, just in time for V-Day. Regardless of if your team won, or however much money you painfully lost, there was still plenty of room to come out of the day with a W. Well, maybe not entirely … now, I need to go donate all of my New England Patriots 2012 Champions gear to the nearest Goodwill …</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks doesn’t mean to generalize. Not all girls hate watching the Super Bowl. However, all of them would prefer to be doing The Titanic.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Ana Murray” align=”aligncenter” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"423182063\" data-slb-group=\"44415\"><img data-attachment-id=\"44416\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/am-superbowlhump-2-8-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?fit=2552%2C2001&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2552,2001\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?fit=250%2C196&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?fit=888%2C696&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-44416\" title=\"AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12-250x196.jpg?resize=250%2C196\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?resize=250%2C196&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C803&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AM-superbowlhump-2-8-12.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44415\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44415\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-08/im-rooting-peyton-manning/","id":6415,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6414,6413,6412],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“I’m Not a Slut, I Swear” and Other Bedroom Mantras","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"“Shit Girls Say” started an epidemic.

A “Shit Guys and Girls Say During or After Hookups That Just Really, Really Should Not Be Happening.” These are a few that need to stop:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>1. The Unprovoked “What?”: God, classic. You’re sprawled out in bed, it’s 7 a.m. and the I.V. construction workers can blatantly see you in the buff through the window. He checks his watch, because, yes, he kept it on throughout the sex. The girl is awake first, as she always is, and just pretending to be asleep (fact). And then, shoot, you’re both awake and you both know it and no one’s talking … so, out of nowhere, the girl looks over and says “Whaaaat?” and the guy all of a sudden remembers why he doesn’t ever want a girlfriend, ever, and responds with, “Nothing.” Nothing, bitch. Nothing. You need to chill out. Nothing. The “what” is a recurring issue. Just stop asking, because, really, has it ever worked? Never has he turned and said, “Actually, you know, I have just been waiting for someone to ask me that. This is what is going on in my hea- Wait! Actually, can I just like have your number to chat?

The Dirty Talk That Haunts You: Sometimes when you’re in bed (read: every time) someone says something that seems so perfectly fitting, but actually isn’t. And then you’re sitting in your 8 a.m. three days later and all of a sudden it creeps back into your head. You’re taking a test, trying to remember the answer to number 3 and all you can hear is, “Swallow that pimp juice” in that bedroom whisper, and you want to crawl into a hole and die. Like, what the fuck is the answer to number 3? That’s all I wanted to know.</p>\n<p>3. The “I’m not a slut, I swear” Line: That awkward moment when both parties are completely naked and condom wrappers are coming off and all of a sudden it turns into a Dr. Phil session. There is no need to get into “what’s your number” talks, but for some reason girls seem to jump at the opportunity to save face before showing a guy their O-face. He probably didn’t think she was a slut when he brought her home, and even if he did, it clearly has not fazed him at all. But now the horrible buzz-kill moment of having to stop to put on a condom has turned into a 35-second segue into, “So listen, these are my morals.” Don’t worry about it. Either stop counting or stop sleeping around. Or call your sluttier friends — they always make you feel better. And even if you run out of fingers … or toes … numbers will always stretch to infinity.</p>\n<p>4. The “No, no, you’re fine, let me push your head down farther” Move: Do you ever eat bananas? And by eat, I mean swallow them entirely whole. If you do, then congratulations! You don’t have a gag reflex! But for those of us that do, it’s really, really not a good time, when you’re coming up for air, for the guy to push your head down farther because you’re “almost there.” (Note: Your definition of “almost” is not the same as ours.) And then there’s the most horrifying moment of all: the run to the bathroom (fingers crossed you even make it) and proj-vom. No one wants that. Just lean back, yo. Lace your fingers behind your head, and we’ll take care of the one downstairs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We all do it. We’re all guilty, and it’s fine. At least we’re not bored enough to make a video about it, or maybe we’re just too embarrassed. Probably both. Peace, love … pimp juice? Yup, yeah, right there with you. I wish I didn’t say it again, too.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks is not a slut, she swears.</p>\n<p>[media-credit name=”Natalie O” align=”aligncenter” width=”250″]<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"848718004\" data-slb-group=\"44138\"><img data-attachment-id=\"44139\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/no-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12.jpg?fit=1662%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1662,604\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12.jpg?fit=250%2C91&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12.jpg?fit=888%2C323&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-44139\" title=\"NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NO-shitpeoplesay-2-1-12-250x90.jpg?resize=250%2C90\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"90\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a>[/media-credit]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-44138\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-44138\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-02-01/im-slut-swear-bedroom-mantras/","id":6425,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6424,6423,6422],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Booty Texting: How to Send the Right Message","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"We’ve all been guilty of booty calling.

If you send out a text and get “I’m eating dinner” in response, then you peaked prematurely, bro.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>There’s also that area of your texting history filled with the people that you only text post-10 p.m. And, more or less, send out texts that don’t even make sense half the time. Your drunken alter ego (you know who I’m talking about) is a real dick who totally fucks over normal you. Even if you claim that drunk you is just an enhanced version of normal you, reevaluate how awesome you really are, and take into account that you may or may not be completely batshit crazy.</p>\n<p>But you know that awkward moment when you feel like you’ve taken up celibacy as your inadvertent New Year’s resolution? That’s a dangerous moment. That is when you may or may not start booty calling your friends, because you’re calling them anyway, and you’re walkin’ around with a conviction to slay that cannot be matched, and boom. Friend zone has turned to complete and utter shit. Welcome to the “I’ve seen you naked and can fully access this image in my mind whenever I want to” zone.</p>\n<p>The awkward conversation that goes down in the morning when you’ve hooked up with one of your friends is horrendous. “So what are you doing today?” “Probably going home and showering and um, hanging out here.” Because shit, all of a sudden you realize that you spend 98 percent of your time with this person and you’re fucked. Literally and freshly. See you later/tonight/at that party/in class/for that dinner I planned to cook you before I knew we were going to wrestle naked. Yeah. Hashtag that shit.</p>\n<p>The other horrible forced booty call is when all of a sudden at 1:49 in the morning you remember you left a ladle or something equally as useless at someone’s house that you’re trying to hook up with. All of a sudden it’s as if the world will stop turning if you can’t make a very complicated (from scratch) soup recipe rightfuckingnow. If you finally convince them to let your drunk ass into their house, be prepared to be shown the door and to please walk out it so that you don’t become a stage five lingerer. If they saw this opportunity in the same way you did, they probably would’ve made a really bad sexual joke with the word ladle in it. God, I really wish I didn’t pick ladle for this example.</p>\n<p>Everyone loves receiving booty calls for the same reason: the predictability of seeing that name flash on your screen and (regardless of the gender) thinking, “Ha. This bitch.” Tell me that’s not the first thought that pops into your head. Get at me, bro.</p>\n<p>Just make sure not to train your tired fingers to text back “I’m down” as your go-to late night response. While this may be appropriate when hitting up late night nachos (which is also not the greatest idea), there’s nothing worse than falling back to sleep and finding out the next morning that your booty caller showed up and you were passed the fuck out.</p>\n<p>Be wary of making the mistake of not checking to make sure you have all of the necessary words in your text. Response to a joke: Are you fucking with me right now? Take out the word “with”, and, well … Shit. Just. Got. Weird.</p>\n<p>And finally, always keep in mind that everything in I.V. tends to come full circle. With house hunting going on, you never know if your booty call may end up moving in next door.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks says there are exceptions to the post-10 p.m. rule of thumb:. Namely Extravaganza and Floatopia, where the drunk texting grace period begins at 11 a.m. and continues through the following day.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43866\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43866\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-25/booty-texting-send-message/","id":6429,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6428,6427,6426],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Don’t Chase Shots, Chase Jerseys: How to Land Yourself One","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"So listen, syllabus week is over.

No, it’s Christmas season round 2: winter sports.</p>\n<p>See, the first time I heard the term “jersey chaser” I responded with, “I chase my alcohol with whiskey,” but when I realized it wasn’t THAT kind of chaser (don’t get me wrong, I don’t run either), I was far more willing to give it the old, ahem, college try.</p>\n<p>Let’s get one thing straight here, those guys carrying around those blue backpacks? Pussy. Magnets. And trust me, I don’t use that term loosely. Here’s the problem though, every single guy who carries one of those knows that. So girls, you have to prepare yourselves. If the captain from the lacrosse team comes up to you, don’t choke and tell him something stupid like, “I’m really good at one-liners.” Because then you’ll be forced to take your shirt off as redemption, and maybe that might make you seem as though you’re coming on too strongly. Well, I take that back.

I learned the ins, the outs and what they actually talk about in the locker room. When people on the team suddenly know your name, don’t get flattered and think you’re a keeper. No, that just means that stories about you have bounced around that room faster than your pretty little head did last Friday night.</p>\n<p>Men with sticks have bigger dicks. Well, that, or they’re flaming douchebags. Okay, that wasn’t cute and didn’t rhyme, but it’s true. So before you run off to become the next puck slut or lacrosstitute, know what you’re getting into. You have to go to the games. You have to. You’re an unpaid, improperly clothed cheerleader. But don’t be too dumb about the rules of the game you’re attending. If you can’t figure out that virtually every sport requires getting the ball from one end to the other, good luck scoring elsewhere.</p>\n<p>But let’s be real, you have to rely on your friends sometimes. What if you “accidentally get a flat tire” on the way to meeting them at the game? You come in all frazzled like a damsel in distress, breathlessly ask, “What did I miss?” And suddenly, it’s as if you’d been there all along!</p>\n<p>Hooking up with an athlete isn’t brain science, though. Don’t get me wrong here. But holding onto one is damn well near impossible. So don’t blow it by asking him immediately what his jersey number is or what it stands for. Most of the time, it’s a good thing. But there are those rare cases where it means something way too sentimental to ask mid-“teach me how to dougie” at their “we just lost but already planned this party” after-party. Save the question for a post-nookie cig-break.</p>\n<p>Another deal breaker? Actually stealing the jersey. Turns out they kind of need those, and when you’ve tacked it to your wall, it can be a little awkward when they bust in your door 20 minutes til game time to demount the jersey … and permanently demount you. (But by all means, start a victory T-shirt collection).</p>\n<p>Also, I have no idea what is going on once they step onto that field, but seriously every single guy steps off broken in at least seven different places, even if all they did was run a few laps during warm-up. So if you get all riled up in bed, ease up on the dominatrix, Kama-sutra bullshit. Even if you think he’s being overdramatic about his hurt shoulder, his teammates are convinced it’s your fault and that their season has immediately gone to shit, and bottom line: they will hunt you down. I’m telling you, that locker room is only used for power play planning and pure fucking evil.</p>\n<p>Being a jersey chaser is like being on The Bachelor. Every girl around you is going for the same guy. So practice some self-control. Or, just go for his friend. But, regardless, remember to get onboard with the mindset of: “Yeah! You could totally make a living out of this!

The last time I checked it was the 12 days of Christmas, not the 12 days of blowies, but hey, we all have our own interpretation of the holiday spirit.</p>\n<p>Or having a random-ass kid you haven’t seen since the early ’90s approach you completely blacked out and instantly assume that you haven’t changed from your fifth-grade self. Mid-shot someone just threw out, “Wow! I thought that you were still practicing abstinence!” The last time we spoke, I was 10, but wishful thinking, kid.</p>\n<p>I would much rather have all of these people safely hidden away on Facebook where they belong, because there are very few things that I appreciate in 3-D. Titanic is probably both the beginning and the ending of that list. (Leo, you’re my homeboy.) So the walking yearbook that my town turned into was no fucking tea party. Actually, if I ever signed any yearbooks at all, I think the extent of it was “HAGS.” Going for the “just-DGAF-enough-to-be-legendary” approach, I guess. Well, okay, I apologize, but high school isn’t really anyone’s prime. And if it was, I’m sorry. Personally, I wouldn’t say I was an alcoholic. I’d say that I was getting a head start. My most notably sloppy behavior happened roughly five or six years ago, and now I finally got my revenge as I watched all the self-proclaimed frat stars and sowhorities get shitfaced off apple pie shots and debatable cranberry vodkas that tasted suspiciously like a Shirley Temple. So many sloppy truths, so little time.</p>\n<p>Speaking of sloppy truths, seeing people face to face I found out real quick who sharpened their Photoshop skills since college began. Oh, so you did gain 20 pounds and still look like a horse. Got it. According to your amateur modeling pictures you post every minute on the minute, I was beginning to think there was going to be some new competition at the bar. Guess not.</p>\n<p>Other than gallivanting around openly tweeting each other (@ms_e_brooks) and passing around Facebook prof pics of the highlights of who you fucked so far in college, I quite enjoyed making inappropriate Christmas puns to the people I never liked in high school. “Fancy seeing you here! Oh it is the most wonderful time of the year!” Until I realized Justin Bieber has a Christmas album out and I was inadvertently quoting him.</p>\n<p>But who are we kidding? Rekindling the old flames is where all the fun really lies. Because let’s face it, no one gives a shit any more. And there’s that whole convenience thing. No more stupid one-liners just to get the girl in your room, like, “Hey wanna see the fish in my room?” People love looking at fish when they’re drunk. It’s a proven fact. Mostly though, you can say whatever the fuck you want because you know exactly when you’ll be leaving. It’s a deadline kind of relationship. I dig it.</p>\n<p>Just think of all the possibilities to be incredibly blunt and obnoxious. As he’s coming throw out a “Whew. Let. It. Snow. You tiger, you.” Or instead of gracefully sneaking out and making your exit, or allowing the bangee to abruptly leave, why not battle who gets to leave first? Throw out a real quick, “Listen, bang and bolt is MY job, don’t steal my thunder, bitch.” What’s fair is fair, and you both know you’re still gonna fuck again tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Going back home gives you the opportunity to redeem blue-balling that kid in high school, or finally getting with that high school sensation (even though he/she probably sucks now … but whatever, moral victory). And when you go to the local bar where everyone knows your name (and all of your dumb mistakes) whether you like it or not, just take comfort in the fact that nothing ever changes.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-01-11/home-heart-mention-hasslefree-lay/","id":6427,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6426,6425,6424],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Exercise Logic: Work Hard Now for Easy Booty Later","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"I was in class last week reading a texting conversation over this guy’s shoulder (stop judging me) where he was trying to hang on to his fuck buddy here in I.V. while simultaneously texting his ex-g...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I was in class last week reading a texting conversation over this guy’s shoulder (stop judging me) where he was trying to hang on to his fuck buddy here in I.V. while simultaneously texting his ex-girlfriend from high school that he loved her.

It’s a fact. You know when you hook up again and all of a sudden it’s like they fucked the swag back into you? It can start off as innocently as trying to make a subpar Thursday night into something better because, “Oh my God my town blooooows,” when, shit; did all the stars just align?</p>\n<p>Really, it’s too easy. The “game” is over, because back when everyone was either playing hard to get or actually was hard to get in high school, our boundaries have slowly been tarnished and/or drowned by cheap vodka as the years in college have gone by. It’s always fun to see the “honors to hooters” kind of girls. You know the ones: brilliant and nerdy in high school, and now casually answer to “slut bag Mcfuck stick.”</p>\n<p>The freshmen are the most fun to watch return. After only two months of experiencing life without parental controls on the TV remote they suddenly have “do me” written across their foreheads. I commend the freshmen who are still dating their lovers from high school and doing the long distance thing, but c’mon; what’s the over/under bet on them breaking up by Jan. 16? Who’s with me?</p>\n<p>Sex with an ex is real-life recycling. Plus, it’s always fun to see what other people are really learning in college. Personally, I think it makes for the best pillow talk. The only way to assure that you are keeping it casual and not falling into the high school sweethearts trap is to swap sexcapade stories. You already know all the boring shit about this person so you might as well make it interesting.</p>\n<p>I don’t know what it is — maybe it’s the fact that you already know the person so well — but the best one-liners come from sex-with-an-ex scenarios. My personal favorite? Being told that getting jizzed on is a necessary evil. And the fact that it can all be played off as being totally normal. Four weeks, ending with coming into the New Year with a bang (see what I did there?), leaves room for weird behavior.</p>\n<p>Speaking of weird behavior, try to avoid telling your ex that they peaked in high school — even if it’s true. And that stupid tattoo that they got in an attempt to be a badass? Just go with it. The holidays are also all about acceptance. Keep your mouth shut, at the very least until the deed is done … it’s what Jesus would do.</p>\n<p>There is a chance that you may regain consciousness and discover that your ex still sucks. Life may not be a personality contest, but high school sure as hell was. And if they’re still stuck in high school, back away slowly. If his pick up line is, “Let me put my ear phone in your iPod,” the night probably isn’t going to be magical. And if they’re still using pick up lines, sweetly advise them to re-evaluate their life.</p>\n<p>But, for your own sake, I hope that it all goes well. And I hope that you come back from break with that extra bounce in your step.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks has hos in different area codes.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-43221\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-43221\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-23/exercise-logic-work-hard-easy-booty/","id":6426,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6425,6424,6423],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Out-of-Towners: Are They Really All That Bad?","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Well now that you’ve all had the glory of saying you hooked up with a French maid, a firefighter or a slutty version of Kate Middleton, it’s time to snap out of that Halloween daze and get back to...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Well now that you’ve all had the glory of saying you hooked up with a French maid, a firefighter or a slutty version of Kate Middleton, it’s time to snap out of that Halloween daze and get back to reality. Yes, the Wednesday Hump is reality. But, in honor of Halloween weekend, let’s talk about out-of-towners. Yeah, they’re fucking annoying, and they’re like desperate eighth-graders begging to fit in, but don’t lie — they have a special place in our hearts (especially when they’re nicely wrapped in a person that’s not themselves).</p>\n<p>We love to hate them, and we hate to love them. Half the girls walk around wearing something so short the whole world can see their pancreas; the guys all find it necessary to throw their arms around any girl that comes within two feet of them, and we’re not sure whether we should be offended or just use it to our advantage.</p>\n<p>There’s a fine line between a walk of shame and just starting around two (or three … or four) hours too early. Is it really kosher to be dressed in a thong and bra, wandering DP before noon yelling, “I’m a Victoria’s Secret Angellllllll”?</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Yeah. Okay. Where are your wings, bitch?</p>\n<p>And what about the Douche Lord who’s attempting to brag about his sex life 24/7, and trying to justify bringing home those tore-up-from-the-floor-up girls, too. “Yeah, you know you gotta slay some dragons before you get the princess. It’s whatever bro. Just livin’ the dream.”</p>\n<p>These things would never happen without our beloved out-of-towners. We, on the other hand, are too self-proclaimed goddamn brilliant to say these things (or at least get caught saying them).</p>\n<p>But see, one of two things happens when we bring an out-of-towner back to our humble abode: we either try that one thing in bed that we’ve always wanted to try, or we fall in love.</p>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to do something absolutely obnoxious just to see what the other person’s reaction would be? Like, could you imagine having sex with a girl, pulling out, cumming on her face and yelling triumphantly, “I’ve got 99 problems but a baby ain’t one”? Maybe that’s too absurd, but I’m pretty sure her face would be priceless — and not just because it would be covered in jizz.</p>\n<p>Halloween is a great time to try out the whole role-playing thing, but there are some people who take their outfits way too seriously. You scored Kim Kardashian, well a girl pretending to be her … close enough, and then halfway through sex she says, “Ohh, can you actually move a little to the left? I think the video camera might be cutting you off.” Shit. Hopefully you dressed as Ray J.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, though, we fall into the trap. Anyone can be super cool when a) you’re only talking to them for 20 minute increments and b) you know that there’s a 98 percent chance you’re never going to see them again. They can easily lie about how fucking awesome they are pre-bone, and then once it’s realized that modern technology was invented, they’ll be scrambling to revamp their Facebook on the three hour ride home before it’s safe to accept your friend request.</p>\n<p>But regardless of how cool we might think they are, we get to ride on our own ego boost the entire time. They think our over-used jokes are fucking hilarious because they haven’t heard them 76 times like the rest of our friends. You basically build a pseudo-relationship that lasts 96 hours, tops. It’s pretty hard to fuck up with that time frame, so it’s pretty easy to think that this out-of-towner is the coolest person ever. If only they had gone to UCSB, then all of your dreams and fantasies would come true.</p>\n<p>On Monday, once the out-of-towners got the fuck out of our way, we got to party with the true Isla Vistians. And, as you were raging your face off — ‘cause it’s a school night and you have a midterm tomorrow but that doesn’t matter because we live in fucking Santa Barbara, man — there comes that awkward moment when dream boy isn’t so dreamy anymore, and he actually lives on Sabado (oh, fuck) … and you’re dressed as Rihanna, and he’s … uh … Chris Brown.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus sex columnist Elizabeth Brooks is probably one of those girls that wore the t-shirts with “Slut Barn” written on them last Floatopia.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42496\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42496\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-11-02/outoftowners-bad/","id":6422,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6421,6420,6419],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"There’s No ‘I’ In Team; And It Really Doesn’t Matter What Team You’re Playing for Anyway","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There are a lot of good things about threesomes.

Draw a diagram if this is getting confusing, just make sure you’re not sketching it in your blue book.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the hardest part of tag teaming is negotiating it. No one is going to offer up, “Let’s go bitch, I’ve done action films.” There’s even a chance that it could start out purely innocent, like watching “Good Burger” on a ’90s Nickelodeon throwback. You could even have brewed up some hot chocolate. Maybe you’re all wearing matching fuzzy socks, cooking some pumpkin bread in the oven and then boom: you’re living out every man’s fantasy. Well, maybe not the “Good Burger” part.</p>\n<p>You know shit’s about to get real when you get the look. It’s all about “the look.” There’s a difference between getting your flirt on and, “Holy shit, this guy/girl is down for a tag team.” “The look” is not subtle. It’s like an eyefuck-and-a-half. And that’s an understatement. Trust me, you’ll know it when you see it.</p>\n<p>Men seem to be fascinated by the fact that women can talk to one another with their eyes. Well, it comes in handy for situations like these, when you end up lacing fingertips with your best friend over the same guy’s dick. That one moment of “are we doing this?” can be conveyed pretty fast without a knee-jerk reaction of shouting, “WHAT THE FUCK?!”</p>\n<p>Once that brave soul lets on that this tag team is crossing the line of mere suggestiveness and entering into the grounds of actually happening, you’ve got to make sure everyone’s on board. It may be uncomfortable, but it avoids that awkward moment of, “Holy shit that is there, and I was just stumbling in here to nap and rally.”</p>\n<p>The undeniable question of who goes first in the sexual endeavors you’ve decided upon needs to be determined quickly. Rock-paper-scissors, coin flip, whoever gets there first … whatever seems appropriate. For that unlucky soul who gets sloppy seconds, if you’re still down, try not to think too hard about the situation and just go with it. Or pull a Houdini and make the other one go again after you. Karma’s a bitch, yo.</p>\n<p>This could be the greatest story two best friends have ever created together. Maybe you fist pumped before, during and after. Turns out you have synchronized “O” faces. Who knew? Maybe you shared your first “too soon” joke right after it was finished. Hah! Riddle me this: It’s parents weekend and I’m sure they’d love to meet you. Debriefing and cocktails, anyone?</p>\n<p>Or it could be the most awkward encounter you’ve ever endured. Maybe it ruins hotdogs for you forever. Say goodbye to those afternoon Dogtown dates.

Got the sexy cop thing goin’ on. Well, I don’t know what kind of underwear Cosmo had in mind, but unless it was rope, there’s a pretty good chance your panties are going to rip. One hand went left, the other went right and R.I.P green lace undies. In theory it’s a good idea, but when you’re dodging an unexpected donkey punch to the face, it’s time to rethink your technique.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Number 2: When you’re at the bar, take off your thong and slip it into his hand.</p>\n<p>I wish that I would have practiced this before I went in for the big leagues. Do you know how hard it is to remove your underwear from your outfit, and do it in a subtle, discreet, sexy manner? Hah, let me enlighten you.</p>\n<p>I had a good plan, too. I was just going to casually slip them off while dancing and tuck them into his hand. After gettin’ low about six times in order to inch my skivvies down to my ankles, I realized I now had to get my feet out of the situation. Thirty seconds of dancing with your underwear around your ankles is like that awkward moment when you’re jacking it with your pants down and you hear Grandma on her way up the stairs. Yeah, mortifying.</p>\n<p>Once I successfully handed them off, the response? “Holy shit, are these yours?”</p>\n<p>“No, I just tore them off some other girl.”</p>\n<p>“Jesus, you’re the horniest girl I’ve ever met in my life.”</p>\n<p>I left him looking like the happiest deer-holding-a-thong-caught-in-headlights and bee-lined home. I think these might be things you’re supposed to do with your husband once you’ve reduced sex down to like, once every leap year, or if you’re down to get unnecessarily freaky with a stranger.</p>\n<p>Real quick side bar here. Imagine the tables turning and a guy removing his tighty-whities and handing them to you. Sexy immediately turns into sex offender. See you on the late night Sunday viewing of “To Catch a Predator.” Educational moment: double standards do go both ways.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Number 25: Wear neon underwear. It’s just plain awesome.</p>\n<p>Easy win here. Don’t mind if I do.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alright, onto “Frisky Foreplay.” Give your man a massage without using your hands. Once he’s totally relaxed, rub your breasts against his penis and he’ll happily rise to the occasion.</p>\n<p>God Cosmo, it’s like you know me. I cheated a little, maybe. I did not discount fingernails here. That light stroke thing going on? #winning.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Be the Boss in Bed: Torture him playfully with your teasing.</p>\n<p>Go channel your inner Rihanna “S&amp;M” here. Yeah, you’re bad and perfectly good at it; sorry I’m not sorry. You can get all kinds of bat-shit crazy here, or just have a tickle fight on steroids. But personally, I should’ve done a few more bicep curls at the gym. Shit, it’s hard to pin somebody back like that and still be, you know, mobile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I guess it all comes down to this: with Cosmo, you win some; you lose some. Now, I need to go do laundry, because, in case you didn’t notice, I lost a few pairs of undies back there.</p>\n<p>Next week, Daily Nexus columnist Elizabeth Brooks will give step-by-step directions on how to master a footjob.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-42029\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/cosmo-tips-true-terrifying/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-42029\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/cosmo-tips-true-terrifying/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/cosmo-tips-true-terrifying/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/cosmo-tips-true-terrifying/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-10-19/cosmo-tips-true-terrifying/","id":6417,"author":{"id":478,"name":"Elizabeth Brooks"},"related":[6416,6415,6414],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"When Early Morning Stealth Fails, Awkwardness Prevails","category":"Opinion","subcategory":"Wednesday Hump","publish_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"If you haven’t had the sheer terror of waking up in a bed that’s not your own, with your first thought being, “I need to get the fuck out of here,” then you haven’t lived.

But, if you do successfully toot it and boot it, you sly dog you, make sure you have all of your stuff with you. If you end up getting back your forgotten items in the same state you left them in, consider yourself lucky. You were outta there faster than a midget in a dunk contest, and let’s face it, people don’t forget.</p>\n<p>You know, I don’t know what it is about bras, but they always end up in places they don’t belong: a kitchen cabinet, a tree. Sometimes their roommate will discover it and throw it out. That’s 40 bucks I’ll never see again, and it was yellow — so, yeah, that was a ray of sunshine I lost too.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, even a repeat hookup can still make you want to get away, maybe even more so, because of that. When morning sex is out of the question, and you really have nothing witty on hand to say, it is simply time to go. One and done, hit it and quit it, lay without pay, I could go on for days here. Lesson learned: don’t be a lingerer. But what exactly is proper morning after etiquette to assure you won’t be just that?</p>\n<p>Let’s face it, no one looks quite as good as they did the night before. It could be because the beer goggles are gone, but add that to the sex hair, running makeup and face creases from your pillow, and well, would you look at that. Shit just got real.</p>\n<p>No one can be bothered worrying about someone’s feelings when you look like you just got hit by the hangover bus. But, you know, you have to at least pretend. My go-to move was always to climb over the other (still sleeping) person, but it never worked. You know that saying, “They always come back?” Well, in this case, they always wake up. I’ll be naked in broad daylight looking for my clothes when they happen to catch me.</p>\n<p>God, you know? That awkward moment when you’re bent in half gathering your items, and peek back just to make sure you didn’t make the worst mistake of your life the night before, and they’re face down, ass up, making eye contact with you, wondering just the same.</p>\n<p>No, the worst possible thing that can happen is when the other person wakes up when you’re in the process of climbing, mid straddle. Let’s not beat around the bush here, no pun intended, one of you has morning wood, so either way you’re about two inches away from hitting up round two. It’s pretty much safe to say that whoever is waking up is down to work off their hangover rather than drowning it in Mexican food.</p>\n<p>Well, so far this has all been under the assumption that you didn’t bring the person home to your house, which is most definitely something to be considered. Welcome to the world of stage five clinger. There’s nothing worse than being trapped in your own house. Ditching this one? Lie, my friend, lie. Say your parents are coming, say you have to meet someone for breakfast, do what you gotta do, kid. You were smart enough to get into this school; you’re smart enough to gaucho ass outta there. (Sorry for being school spirited … go soccer).</p>\n<p>Anyway, just make sure you follow through with your lie. Don’t start gallivanting around I.V. because you will run into them. Seriously, it will happen. It’s Murphy’s Law or some shit. Look it up.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately if these two escape routes fail, no matter whose house you’re shackin’ at, it pretty much leaves you with talking. You can even use the opportunity to become best friends with their roommate.
