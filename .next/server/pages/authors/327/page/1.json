The first few months of the season are, and I’m exaggerating a little, a wash. After 15 games, the Kings were near the top of the Western Conference and the Stars were in the cellar. Now, just past the halfway point of the year, the teams have flip-flopped, with the Stars making a heroic rise from the ashes and looking like contenders while the Kings have been playing some ugly hockey for most of the past couple of months.</p>\n<p>What’s happened so far in the season is altogether not as important as what will happen over the next month. By the end of February, it’ll be clear which teams are aiming for the playoffs and which teams are looking to cast off spare parts at the trade deadline, which takes place in early March. Right now, there are only five teams out of 30 who don’t have a realistic shot to make the playoffs. For the rest, particularly the bubble teams, it’s crunch time.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Here are five games in the next 30 days that should be available to most of you. All of them have playoff implications and show off some of the league’s top stars:</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Philadelphia Flyers v. Chicago Blackhawks</strong></p>\n<p><em>Sunday, Jan. 23 at 9:30 a.m. on NBC</em></p>\n<p>This game is a Stanley Cup Finals rematch featuring the Flyers, who currently lead the league with 30 wins on the season and have looked every bit a contender this year, against the defending-champion Hawks, who started off the year slowly but are just now rounding into championship form.</p>\n<p>The Flyers will be getting top defenseman Chris Pronger back within the next few days and the Hawks just regained the services of Marian Hossa, Jonathan Toews, and Patrick Kane over the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>It should be a high-scoring affair with plenty of end-to-end action and some great hitting. These teams don’t like each other very much and it shows.</p>\n<p><strong>San Jose Sharks v. Los Angeles Kings</strong></p>\n<p><em>Wednesday, Jan. 26 at 7:30 p.m. on Fox Sports West</em></p>\n<p>Things have been bad in both Los Angeles and San Jose lately. Both teams, rife with talent, have shown flashes of greatness this year, but as a whole have been playing far below their potential.</p>\n<p>The Sharks, who entered the season expected to contend for the Stanley Cup, are two wins removed from a six-game losing streak and have been shutout seven times on the season. The Kings, after going 9-4-1 in December, are in the midst of their worst slump of the year. They’re 2-8-0 in their last 10 games and have sunk to 12th in the Western Conference.</p>\n<p>Neither of the two underperforming teams is in a playoff spot right now and both are clawing to get back into the race. Expect a spirited matchup with lots of physical play, as it’s a big test for both squads.</p>\n<p><strong>New York Rangers v. Detroit Red Wings</strong></p>\n<p><em>Monday, February 7 at 4:30 p.m. on Versus</em></p>\n<p>The Red Wings are the NHL’s model modern franchise. They’ve made the playoffs 19 straight seasons, the longest streak in sports, and have reached the Stanley Cup Finals six times in that stretch, taking home the championship on four occasions.</p>\n<p>The New York Rangers have been the Yankees of baseball for the last twenty years, but with only a modicum of success. After winning a Stanley Cup in 1994 and trailing off afterwards, the team tried to buy its way back to the top with big name talent, but has yet to reach the Cup Finals again since.</p>\n<p>The Red Wings have kept on doing their thing and sit atop the Western Conference, while a philosophy change in New York has gotten the ball rolling again for them. After a quick rebuild, the team now has some quality young players and is on the rise again.</p>\n<p>These two teams have a long history with each other, being two of the “Original Six” teams, and the fans have become accustomed to hating each other’s guts, a mindset that spills onto the ice and really gets the players going. It might be a low scoring game, but it won’t be without fireworks.</p>\n<p><strong>Los Angeles Kings v. Pittsburgh Penguins</strong></p>\n<p><em>Thursday, February 10 @ 4:00 p.m. on the NHL Network</em></p>\n<p>Though the Sidney Crosby Show is temporarily off the air in Pittsburgh as he recovers from a concussion sustained during the Winter Classic, there’s hope that he’ll be back by the beginning of February. If that’s the case, it’ll be the first chance for Kings fans to get a look at Sid since November of 2009.</p>\n<p>Games against top teams are always benchmarks, and this one is no exception. The Kings stomped the Penguins 5-2 the last time they played them and will be hoping for a similar result this time around, but the Penguins have the benefit of being on home ice this time around. Pittsburgh is battling with Philadelphia for the top spot in the Eastern Conference and every game in the next few months will be a key one for them.</p>\n<p>The Penguins are a damn fun team to watch with lots of speed and talent and the Kings bring their A-game against top teams, you don’t want to miss this one.</p>\n<p><strong>Washington Capitals v. Anaheim Ducks</strong></p>\n<p><em>Wednesday, February 16 @ 7:00 p.m. on Fox Sports Prime Ticket</em></p>\n<p>The league’s other superstar, Alex Ovechkin, will visit the left coast with the Capitals for a four-game road trip against Pacific Division teams in February. The Ducks and Capitals play a similar game, both depending largely on offensive firepower and speed to win hockey games, which makes for some exciting hockey.</p>\n<p>Jonas Hiller has been single-handedly winning plenty of games for the Ducks this year and will have to come up big against Washington’s big guns. Alex Ovechkin has yet to find his groove so far this year but will undoubtedly get better down the stretch as the games start to mean more; he’s a gamer in every sense of the word.</p>\n<p>The other thing to watch for is how Washington holds up against the Ducks top forwards in their own zone. It’ll be a challenge for the Capitals’ blueline and goaltending, both of which have been shaky this year overall, to hold off the Ducks talent up front.</p>\n<p>This one should be a high scoring contest and don’t be surprised if it gets chippy, there are plenty of guys who aren’t afraid to mix it up on both squads.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-31946\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-31946\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2011-01-19/deity-ice-great-month-hockey/","id":2165,"author":{"id":327,"name":"Josh Deitell"},"related":[2164,2163,2162],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Deity of the Ice: Beating the Shit Out of People … for Good Reason","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"There’s one misconception about hockey that bugs me.

If a player makes questionable body contact, particularly on a more talented player, they will have to answer the bell.</p>\n<p>Late hits, hits from behind into the boards and hits to the head or knees are just a few examples of checking that necessitate a player to fight.

The desire to scrap is usually signified visually by a shaking of the gloves and verbally by an overt challenge, such as, “Want to go?” Once a player drops the gloves, he is considered the instigator.</p>\n<p>The player who steps in to defend his teammate risks initiating a fight with a dance partner who isn’t willing. It’s frowned upon to throw a cheap shot and refuse to fight afterward.</p>\n<p>To go after someone and start pounding on them can get the aggressor kicked out of the game and result in a penalty for instigating. Despite this punishment, players who stick up for their teammates are highly respected, even if the player who threw the cheap hit doesn’t consent. If that player does consent to defend himself and can hold his own, he gains a bit of respect, although it’s generally not enough to offset the cheap hit.</p>\n<p>Most talented players don’t fight on a regular basis. Usually, when a skilled player is about to get involved in an altercation, one of the scrappier players on the roster will step in and put himself at risk. It may seem like a puss move by the more talented player, but the hierarchy demands this type of sacrifice from certain players on the roster.</p>\n<p>There are exceptions in the hierarchy. Some skilled players are willing to take matters into their own hands. But for elite athletes who make millions of dollars expected to contribute in other areas, fighting is an unnecessary medical risk. A broken hand can sideline a player for a month, while a concussion from getting knocked out can derail an entire career.</p>\n<p>In fact, many players are just on the roster for scrapping ability and continuously have to fight to maintain their status as valuable members of the team. Most teams have a heavyweight for this purpose. Heavyweights are categorized as such because of their size and fighting ability.</p>\n<p>Consider Deryk Engelland, standing 6’2” and weighing 202 pounds. He’s a small side heavyweight. Consider Derek Boogaard, standing at 6’7” and about 275 pounds. He’s the biggest.</p>\n<p>Mike Tyson in his prime clocked in at around 6’0”, 220 pounds. Having a monster like Boogaard on your team, even on the bench, discourages opposing players from taking liberties with your team for fear of retribution. It’s not necessary that they play to be effective.</p>\n<p>In cases of retribution or personal vendettas, things can get downright nasty, with guys continuing to go at each other after the zebras try to step in, fighting strictly to injure. In a scrap between enforcers, when the refs come in to break things up, accomplished fighters will give each other a nod or a tap to signify a “good fight.” There is always a certain level of respect that must be maintained.</p>\n<p>Fighting is a worst-case scenario, but it has a time and place in the sport. To create or swing momentum, rather than taking themselves off the ice for five minutes to serve a fighting penalty, players would do better to throw a crushing hit. But those opportunities occur infrequently, and chasing after that big hit can create scoring chances for the other team, so sometimes fighting is the only way to right the ship and get back on track. To get back at a team for a hit, it would be more effective to score a few goals and get retribution with a win, but guys don’t think logically when their teammates get hit hard, particularly when an injury occurs.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the gloves just have to drop.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>Hockey columnist Josh Deitell wishes he were 6’7”, 275.

In a place like California, it’s hard to see it any other way.</p>\n<p>It’s June 2, 2010. I’m eating dinner with my girlfriend in Goleta while the Blackhawks play the Flyers in Game 3 of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals. I check the score on my phone. It’s 2-2. There are two big screen TVs in the restaurant: one tuned to SportsCenter, the other to ESPNews. I ask the bartender if he can turn on the hockey game. “Sure, chief. No problem.”</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later I’m still watching ESPNews. Again, I go up to ask him to change it. He’s annoyed. He’s annoyed? I do the best I can to keep my cool, but it’s the Stanley Cup fucking Finals. He begrudgingly grabs the remote.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The championship series of one of the world’s major sports can’t get play over early-season baseball highlights. That’s Santa Barbara’s relationship with hockey in a nutshell. The bartender changed the channel to the NHL network — a repeat of a Bruins game from two years ago. But he can’t tell the difference.</p>\n<p>Hockey’s not a sport that translates well to a small screen. The camera follows the puck so your eyes follow the puck, but the overall picture is much more crucial. Hockey’s about momentum: It’s easier to understand if you can see the entire ice surface at once.</p>\n<p>Make your way across the border to Canada and you’ll notice that hockey’s prominence in the media equals America’s big three sports. If you live in Toronto and you’re not a Maple Leafs fan, people question why. If you live in Toronto and root for the Senators, you have thousands of enemies.</p>\n<p>Forsaking the sport completely in Canada is akin to living in Hollywood and not enjoying film. It just doesn’t make sense.</p>\n<p>Even in American hockey “hotbeds” like Boston and Minnesota, the hockey teams take a backseat to the Red Sox, the Patriots and the Celtics, the Twins and the Vikings.  The state of hockey is even more dire in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>If you want to understand hockey and keep up with the happenings of the sport in America (particularly on the West Coast) you really have to dig.</p>\n<p>The sport is a chain of ebbs and flows that demands sustained effort. Success is built step by step and requires intense precision. A team can’t score without getting the puck into the zone, which can’t happen without an individual effort to get the puck up the ice or to place an accurate pass through bodies and skates, which can’t happen without first getting the puck out of their zone and so on.</p>\n<p>All of these actions take place at high speed, on ice, on skates, with players the size of linebackers interrupting the puck carrier with body checks.</p>\n<p>Think of scoring a goal like climbing a ladder while getting attacked by bees. Then you’ll see that poise in the face of pressure is prized above all else.</p>\n<p>These are the kinds of things I wish someone would have explained to that bartender in Goleta. Rather than having to go back to the bar a third time, the game would have been on from the moment I walked in the door. I’d be discussing the Blackhawks’ breakout patterns and the Flyers’ goalie Michael Leighton and his poor positioning, with other hockey fans at the bar.</p>\n<p>Yet, when I write that faux-retrospective fantasy in a Santa Barbara state of mind, it seems ridiculous. I can count on both hands the people I know from around here with whom I would be able to have that kind of conversation.</p>\n<p>I love hockey. I want everyone to love hockey. Goddamn it, if I have to explain the sport on a fundamental level and build it from the ground up to get people interested, then that’s what I’ll do. It’s not just that I want more friends to talk hockey with, I think everyone deserves to at least have an understanding of the sport and give it a fair shake.</p>\n<p>People never give hockey a chance. The next time you’re flipping through channels and you come across a hockey game, stop, and even if you don’t completely understand what’s going on. If you find yourself confused, that’s OK. But if you find yourself intrigued, pursue that interest. It’s a beautiful sport, the greatest there is: I’m still impressed every day by the unpredictability and the endless possibilities of what 12 players on ice with sticks and a puck can do. Learn it and enjoy it. I promise you won’t regret it.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-27813\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-27813\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2010-10-21/deity-ice-case-hockey-america/","id":2271,"author":{"id":327,"name":"Josh Deitell"},"related":[2270,2269,2268],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/327"}},"__N_SSG":true}
