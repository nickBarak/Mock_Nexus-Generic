He authored the award-winning book Punished: Policing the Lives of Black and Latino Boys, analyzing how juvenile crime policies and criminalization affect the everyday lives of urban youth.</p>\n<p>Rios began the discussion recounting his most recent TED Talk in New York City, which Steven Spielberg, among others, attended. Rios repeated the first few lines of his TED Talk to the audience, describing what he and others call the “school-to-prison pipeline.”</p>\n<p>“For over a decade, I have studied young people that have been pushed out of schools — so called ‘drop outs,’” Rios said. “As they are failed by the education system, they are put on the streets where they are vulnerable to police harassment and incarceration.”</p>\n<p>Rios said he can relate to the children neglected by the American education system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-21.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1091138872\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66425\"><img data-attachment-id=\"66403\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/rios_by-alex-nagase-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-21.jpg?fit=1325%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1325,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"Alex Nagase\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447183330\",\"copyright\":\"2012\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Rios_by Alex Nagase-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-21.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-21.jpg?fit=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-66403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-21-678x1024.jpg?resize=678%2C1024\" alt=\"Rios_by Alex Nagase-2\" width=\"678\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-21.jpg?resize=678%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-21.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rios_by-Alex-Nagase-21.jpg?w=1325&amp;ssl=1 1325w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p>“The reason I study kids that get in trouble with the law is because in many ways I was one of them,” Rios said. “In the hood, if you want to commit suicide, you don’t have to kill yourself. There are many people that can do it for you.”</p>\n<p>Rios said when he was younger, he stood on corners with his arms wide open in despair, hoping to be shot in a drive-by.</p>\n<p>“It was a chance encounter when my best friend was killed that led me to want to change,” Rios said. “I didn’t want to go to prison. I didn’t want to end up dead. People we might consider lost souls are like oysters, they are only going to open up when they are ready to change.”</p>\n<p>Rios said he felt disbelief upon being admitted to California State University East Bay, on academic probationary status and with a 1.9 grade point average, describing the occurrence as a “second chance.”</p>\n<p>“It’s important to speak truth and power, but it’s also important to speak truth to people,” Rios said. “Those college students spoke truth to me, and that is why I am here today … The social justice work that you do is a matter of life or death and I am just one example of this.”</p>\n<p>Rios encouraged the audience to consider applying to graduate school, which he said had opened doors for him.</p>\n<p>“Find your purpose and do something with your education that can open up doors for advocating for what you believe in,” Rios said.</p>\n<p>Third-year black studies and sociology double major Janet Lopez said she took Rios’ course on juvenile justice this past summer.</p>\n<p>“Rios is really down to earth and relatable since he is from the inner cities of Oakland,” Lopez said. “He has been through a lot in his life and he is a really genuine teacher. His life story and the way he interacts with his students is one of the main reasons why I really wanted to come to this talk tonight.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major Stephanie Periban said Rios inspired her to act on issues affecting Latino students.</p>\n<p>“Rios is also a true inspiration for the Latino community. Anyone that could overcome the adversities Rios has faced and become the success story and inspiration he is today deserves a standing ovation,” Periban said.<br>\nThird-year sociology major Yessica Becerra said she enjoyed the event and hopes to take a course with Rios before graduating.</p>\n<p>“When I saw this event on Facebook, I got really excited and cleared my schedule,” Becerra said. “I’m really glad I’m here and get to experience him as a lecturer, and hope that in my last five quarters I have the opportunity to take a course with him.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Nov. 12, issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66425\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66425\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-12/professor-rios-lectures-on-justice-race/","id":2601,"author":{"id":142,"name":"Erin Kownacki"},"related":[2600,2599,2598],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"KCSB’s Second Annual Hello World!

Collaborated with several different organizations in the community including the Isla Vista Food Co-op, A.S.

spoke with Active Minds members.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people came up to us and wanted to talk about what this event is about,” Singh said. “Some of them shared their stories with us and how they have been impacted by something like this or know someone who has.”</p>\n<p>Third-year communication major Erika Peralta said there is a “good amount” of mental health services available to students, and taking advantage of these services can “have a huge impact.”</p>\n<p>“It’s just taking that step and reaching out and getting help when you need it,” Peralta said.</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology major Erica Nadler said she was “taken aback” by the fact that most college students who commit suicide do so without first seeking out mental health services.</p>\n<p>“[There] seems to be a common

Packing on October 12 on the Student Resource Building (SRB) lawn from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>Active Minds, a nationwide nonprofit organization aiming to change the stigma surrounding mental illness and encourage students to seek help, debuted the event at the National Mall in Washington D.C. in 2008. Since then, more than 320,000 people in 98 cities throughout the country have attended Send Silence Packing. The event displays 1,100 backpacks to represent the 1,100 college students who lose their lives to suicide each year. According to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, suicide is the second-leading cause of death for college students.</p>\n<p>Active Minds staff advisor and Associate Director of Student Mental Health Coordination Services Ryan Sims said the host organizations have worked hard to make the event possible.</p>\n<p>“The event really has been three years in the making,” Sims said. “Active Minds has partnered with Mental Wellness Center to fundraise over $5,000 to put the event on, which is something we are very proud of.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara Mental Wellness Center CEO Annmarie Cameron said universities have to “compete” to host a Send Silence Packing event.</p>\n<p>“The process of getting Send Silence Packing to come to UCSB has taken three years,” Cameron said. “To qualify, the university itself has to provide adequate emotional support for the students that are impacted by the exhibit and UCSB’s mental health services are exceptional for this type of event.”</p>\n<p>C.A.P.S. Director Jeanne Stanford said she hopes seeing backpacks at the event will “make it real” for students that suicide can affect their peers.</p>\n<p>“I hope the message that people will take away is that we are all affected by suicide,” Stanford said. “Talking to your friend if you see that they’re struggling and knowing how to help someone struggling is so important for college students.”</p>\n<p>Sims said he believes the “powerful display” will prompt those passing by to consider what the backpacks represent.</p>\n<p>“Many of the backpacks were created by friends, family members and partners of those that have passed away and include the student’s personal stories, pictures and treasured personal belongings,” Sims said. “I’m most looking forward to UCSB students pausing for a moment, taking this all in and thinking about who might be writing their story if they’re considering suicide as a way of ending their pain.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year sociology major Lauren Peterson said she will attend the event because she struggled with depression and anxiety her first year at UCSB, but hesitated to seek out metal health services in fear of others thinking less of her.</p>\n<p>“Mental health stigmas prevented me from seeking help or even talking to anyone about my depression and anxiety,” Peterson said. “Once I was able to talk to others, their acceptance and drive to learn more about mental health was so relieving and helped me greatly.”</p>\n<p>Due to the sensitive nature of this event, Sims said C.A.P.S. will provide psychologists for the event.</p>\n<p>“Everyone will be impacted uniquely, and having these psychologists on the day of is a cornerstone of being selected as a school to host,” Sims said.</p>\n<p>Stanford said Send Silence Packing will serve as a “kickoff event” for UC Student Association’s upcoming mental health campaign, #HowAreYou.</p>\n<p>“Most people that are considering suicide do want to talk about it. Something as simple as ‘how are you’ can really help someone that is struggling with a mental illness,” Stanford said.</p>\n<p>Active Minds will host their first informational meeting on Tuesday in the SRB multipurpose room at 6 p.m. for students interested in the organization.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:
