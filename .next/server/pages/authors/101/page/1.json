Environmental Affairs Board and the A.S. Food Bank budget. However, $11,259.98 came directly from A.S. funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former A.S. President Austin Hechler, who has been involved in the renovation since it was brought to A.S., spoke at the opening ceremony about how UC Santa Barbara continues to lead the fight against food insecurity for the entire UC system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hechler also commented that it’s “truly remarkable” how preeminent the food bank is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breanna Jones, A.S. Food Bank Committee chair and fourth-year English and film studies double major, spoke at the opening about the space’s importance to students and her hopes that the larger area will better serve its clients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Moving forward, I really want the space to be a place where people come and feel welcome no matter what,” Jones said. “Hopefully through that we can destigmatize the notion of being food insecure.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marquardt</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, fourth-year political science major and internal affairs coordinator for the A.S.

One of the students died after being rushed to the hospital.</p>\n<p>While this incident is not considered a mass shooting, which is defined as a shooting where four or more people are killed by a firearm, Martinez said he believes it is similar to many mass shootings in the country because it was calculated and included the shooter committing suicide.</p>\n<p>In response to the events, Martinez spoke in advocacy of a gun control bill currently passing through the California state legislature, Assembly Bill 424 (AB 424).</p>\n<p>AB 424 aims to keep school district superintendents or other equivalent school authorities from providing permission to possess a firearm in a school zone.</p>\n<p>The bill passed through committee for a second time on April 5 and must now go through a third reading before being sent off to the state senate.</p>\n<p>“The current California law states that guns are prohibited K through 12, but there is an exception if schools approve it,” Martinez said. “AB 424 takes away the exception and says there shouldn’t be any guns on school property.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the three biggest problems with having guns in schools are the increase in risks of accidental shootings, complications with law enforcement in emergency situations and elevating conflict.</p>\n<p>“The situation is when you have a good guy with a gun and a bad guy with a gun, the police don’t know which is the shooter and complicate the situation further,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>Martinez said “there isn’t one solution” to gun violence, but he believes AB 424 is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>“If you have a solution to gun violence, will it work 100 percent of the time? No.</p>\n<p>But the same goes for seatbelts. Just because they don’t work all the time doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use them,” Martinez said. “Would it ever work 100 percent of the time? No. But it’s absurd that we’re in this situation, and we need to do better.”</p>\n<p>Martinez stressed the importance of gun violence reform and compared the United States’s policy to that of gun laws in other countries, where there is significantly less gun violence.</p>\n<p>“It needs to stop,” stated Martinez. “An American woman is 16 times more likely to be shot with a gun than in another country. We should not have to live like this.

For all, however, it is a time of celebration and reflection.”</p>\n<p>For those of you who are unsure what a “visual album” consists of, it is essentially a series of music videos that come together to create a single story. The characters don’t have any dialogue; the story is told entirely through the songs used. And the music used for this short film is by a famous UCSB graduate whom we all know and love.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Danielle Erwin, a fourth-year film and media studies major and the producer of the project, said, “The music really drives the plot of the story with the lyrics and vibe of the song.

He’s kind of a legend in the community,” said Erwin. “We all just kind of fell in love with the project.”<br>\nAbout 15 minutes in length and told through five of Johnson’s songs, the project was initially created due to the negative media attention I.V. has received over the past several years. Co-director and writer of the visual album Connor Haines, a fifth-year in the film and media studies department, came up with the idea while Googling Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>“If you ever Google-search Isla Vista, it’s not the greatest thing in the world,” Haines stated. “I was sitting in class one day, and that’s what I was doing. I felt like there needed to be more positive ideas of I.V. and UCSB. I was trying to think of ways to do that, and the idea of a visual album came to my head.”</p>\n<p>Explaining the album and comparing it to Beyoncé’s Lemonade or Frank Ocean’s Endless, Haines elaborated that he came up with a pitch for Jack Johnson to be able to use his music in a soundtrack about students’ lives on the last day of Spring Quarter. Erwin stated, “As seniors creating a love letter to UCSB and I.V., it was perfect to use Jack Johnson.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the team, Joe Palladino, the film and media studies advisor, was able to get in contact with Johnson’s wife, Kim, who then passed the message along to her husband.</p>\n<p>“[Palladino] sent the pitch I designed to Kim, and she emailed back and said that Jack and her were both on board for the project, and it was as simple as that. They got back to us the same day; it was amazing,” said Haines.</p>\n<p>Now that the group has the rights to Johnson’s music (using “Better Together,” “Rodeo Clowns,” “Staple It Together,” “Talk of the Town” and “Symbol in my Driveway”), they are starting the filming process.<br>\nHaines enthused, “For prospective students and parents, they don’t really get to see the experiences all the students have. The goal is to show what it really means to be a Gaucho.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76668\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"578485964\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76665\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76668\" data-attachment-id=\"76668\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-05/ucsb-filmmakers-join-forces-with-jack-johnson/jack-johnson-film-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"jack johnson film 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76668\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jack-johnson-film-2.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76668\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Mika Pham</p></div>\n<p>The visual album has already raised $1,875, and the group is continuing to fundraise for the project.<br>\nThe students working on the short film want it to carry the warmth and joy that makes Jack Johnson’s songs so special. Their love for I.V. is truly the driving force behind the project. If they do not reach their fundraising goal, they intend to continue making the film in any way possible. Their fundraising website expresses, “For us, this is a labor of love, and we will finish it no matter what.”</p>\n<p>Haines passionately concluded, “I.V. has gone through a lot in the last couple years. Right, wrong or indifferent, a lot of the attention directed toward our community and this school is negative.

Four of six cases at UCSB were reported by students, and the remaining were reported by UC staff.</p>\n<p>The only full-time professor named in UCSB documents was Gurinder Singh Mann, a professor of global studies.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a complaint in May 2013 from a female student alleging that Mann acted inappropriately with sexual conduct, both verbal and physical, during a research discussion meeting at Mann’s home.</p>\n<p>Mann retired in 2015 but was a professor at the time of the investigation, which began in May 2013.</p>\n<p>According to the documents, the female complainant said Mann asked her to sit on his bed with him and proceeded to lay beside her. While sitting on the bed, Mann allegedly touched her neck and chest around the area of her collarbone.</p>\n<p>She said he inserted his hand inside her shirt, touched her stomach and put his face near to hers. When she confronted him, he responded that “he’s not a dirty old man, that, for him, what he had done was just like petting his cat.”</p>\n<p>The student later wrote an email to Mann saying, “this really was extremely uncomfortable for me, I still have nightmares about it.” She also alleged that Mann, on several occasions, would rub her arm, shoulder and thigh.</p>\n<p>In the Title IX report, Mann denied all allegations of harassment and said his primary aim was establishing a Santa Barbara school of Sikh studies, not “playing with young people in any way.”</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the Title IX office concluded in August 2013 that all such claims “more likely than not did occur” and that Mann had violated the UC’s sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>The documents do not indicate actions taken by the university, and Mann has since been a guest lecturer at UCSB after his retirement.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in May 2014 claiming that former music department lecturer Paul Sahuc allegedly sexually harassed a former music department graduate student.</p>\n<p>The female subject claimed that Sahuc had said on multiple occasions, “Are you on your period?” during lessons. She also stated that he repeatedly walked into the women’s dressing room unannounced while people were changing.</p>\n<p>According to the documents, several other witnesses offered information illustrating patterns of sexualized comments from Sahuc.</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the UCSB Title IX office concluded that the alleged conduct “more likely than not did occur,” and that both allegations violated sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76156\" style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76156\" data-attachment-id=\"76156\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2-27-10-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=465%2C531&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"465,531\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Screen shot 2017-03-02 at 2.27.10 PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?fit=465%2C531&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76156\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?resize=465%2C531\" alt=\"\" width=\"465\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?w=465&amp;ssl=1 465w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-2.27.10-PM.png?resize=219%2C250&amp;ssl=1 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As a result, the music department declined to renew Sahuc’s employment contract, effectively terminating his university employment.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office also received a report in April 2013 alleging that Facilities Management laborer Cresenciano Marin sexually harassed a senior custodian.</p>\n<p>The female subject had previously complained to her supervisors about Marin’s conduct, but she received no resolution. A formal investigation began in April 2013.</p>\n<p>As detailed in the documents, the complainant said while riding in an elevator together during their shift, Marin came up behind her as she bent down and put his hand on her back without her consent and made gestures “as to mock a sexual position.” After she told him he was being inappropriate, he responded that he would find her later and “violate/rape” her.</p>\n<p>The complainant said Marin told her on several other occasions that she should “suck his dick,” asked her the color of her underwear and asked if the color of her pubic hair was the same color as the hair on her head.</p>\n<p>The investigation also found that on an unknown date, coworkers found pornographic videos and newspaper clippings of the <em>Nexus</em>’ “Wednesday Hump” as well as “December 2006 Playboy Magazine Digital Edition” in his cleaning closet.</p>\n<p>Marin denied all such claims, but the Title IX office substantiated all 11 sexual harassment claims against him. The university terminated his employment in July 2013 following the findings of the investigation.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in April 2015 that a UCPD supervisor allegedly sexually harassed his female employee during an after-hours celebration at American Ale in downtown Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the male subject went to hug his employee and “grabbed her breast,” to which she “stood stupefied” and didn’t say anything. She went to push him away, but he “grabbed her face and stuck his tongue down her throat.” When she turned back around, he tried to hug her and “bit her neck, leaving a mark.”</p>\n<p>The documents report that, when the female returned to the outdoor seating area, she informed the group that she was attacked. A witness reported to the Title IX office that the same male had “pinched his/her buttocks earlier that night.”</p>\n<p>The male subject claimed he “blacked out” the night of the incident and could not respond to the allegations because he could not remember.</p>\n<p>At the time of the allegation, he was working half-time in his department, and he became a full-time employee in July 2015.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, UCSB required the male subject to complete the university’s online sexual harassment prevention training and attend personal counseling.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office received a report in November 2015 that a music department lecturer allegedly sexually harassed a former music department student.</p>\n<p>The student claimed she was harassed through verbal conduct during piano lessons and that the male subject would comment on other women, saying “so-and-so’s boobs are hanging out,” “so-and-so’s ass cheeks are hanging out” and “women are provocative, and the things they wear seduce men, and it’s no wonder that all these women get raped.”</p>\n<p>Another complainant said the music lecturer would tell her sexualized comments he made to other students like, “If this composer was here, he’d want to seduce you.”</p>\n<p>The male subject denied the allegations against him, but the Title IX office concluded that the conduct “more likely than not did occur” and that the music lecturer had violated UC sexual harassment policy.</p>\n<p>As a result of the investigation, the male subject received a 10 percent salary reduction and a written censure.</p>\n<p>The Title IX office also received a report that a faculty member from the global studies department allegedly sexually harassed a fourth-year undergraduate student.</p>\n<p>According to the female complainant, the male faculty member made jokes promoting rape culture that had no relevance to the class. The jokes were, “What was the wife’s favorite sex position? Facing Nordstrom’s.” and “Why were the sorority girls disappointed about being gang-raped? Because they had to write so many thank-you cards.”</p>\n<p>The female complainant spoke out during lecture, saying that he was being inappropriate. The female subject dropped the global studies class that same day due to the “sexist classroom climate.”</p>\n<p>She stated in her interview with the Title IX office that she could not concentrate for the remainder of the class because she was so upset by his comments. When asked what resolutions she sought through the process, she said that she did not believe the male subject should be teaching at the university.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the male faculty member wrote through his attorney that he did not use the words “the wife,” “raped” or “sororities,” but admitted the jokes were made in poor taste.</p>\n<p>Following an investigation, the Title IX office substantiated one of the three sexual harassment claims against the faculty member. The documents do not indicate whether the university took further disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>According to UCSB Spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the university investigated and adjudicated all of the UCSB cases under policies and processes that have since been updated.</p>\n<p>“Over the past two and a half years, UC has taken steps to significantly change — and improve — the ways such cases are handled,” she said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> also obtained the Title IX documents of eight other campuses — UC Merced, UC Los Angeles, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Irvine and UC San Diego — and is currently sorting through them to determine further details.</p>\n<p>Although UC Berkeley has not yet sent in its documents, the <em>Daily Cal</em> provided the number of sexual misconduct cases listed for its campus.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The new design is more simple and straightforward, and it will allow for easy navigation of the library’s database and its material.</p></div>\n<p>The UCSB Library website got a major remodel at the beginning of Winter Quarter, updating its outdated homepage with an accessible new look.</p>\n<p>It is the first redesign of the site in more than five years. The new appearance is intended to reflect elements of the UCSB Library’s physical renovation and mirror its status at a competitive research university.</p>\n<p>Marcos Aguilar, the reference and information supervisor at the library, said the transition is based on creating a new online database system and improving the availability of library materials for students and faculty.</p>\n<p>The new online database is a catalog software update that was outsourced through a software company. This update provides a simple navigational structure and reduces the number of pages required for users to find specific research materials.</p>\n<p>“The main motivation has to do with material circulation,” Aguilar said. “Right now, the catalog looks the same as it did before. The homepage is sleeker and more visually stimulating, though.”</p>\n<p>The reason for the redesign was not only to modernize the website but to make click-thru links smoother and add mobile-friendliness. The library is currently installing the catalog update and should complete it by the next school year.</p>\n<p>According to the Library’s website, the new catalog takes advantage of “increased database-driven functionality to minimize duplicate content.”</p>\n<p>The website revamp is the result of a “thoughtful review process” that involved conducting user testing, collecting survey data and website analytics over many years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_74946\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74946\" data-attachment-id=\"74946\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/library-website-gets-first-facelift-in-5-years/library-photo-courtesy-of-karen-lindell/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=2000%2C1071&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1071\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"library-photo-courtesy-of-karen-lindell\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=250%2C134&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell.jpg?fit=888%2C475&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74946\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Library-Photo-Courtesy-of-Karen-Lindell-1024x548.jpg?resize=888%2C475\" alt=\"The UCSB Library opened its new building in January 2016.

The original Davidson Library was built in 1954, and it was intended to be the geographical center of the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>The new building is considerably more modern and features drop-lighting, a new transfer center, expanded seating areas and a café open during daylight hours.</p>\n<p>Since the building’s reconstruction, the university has also hired staff members to push the facility into a new era of technology.  This summer, Thomas Padilla came onboard as the first ever humanities data curator in the UC system. Padilla works with humanities departments which can vary in data usage from traditional S.T.E.M. fields.</p>\n<p>New Mac computers also made their debut in the Learning Commons earlier this summer, which are now the only Mac computers available on campus for general student use.</p>\n<p>Funding for the computers came from the library’s budget, mostly made up of state money and private donations. The library also plans to use $30,000 to $40,000 from the Class of 2016 senior class gift to install additional technology.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74987\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/library-website-gets-first-facelift-in-5-years/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74987\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/library-website-gets-first-facelift-in-5-years/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/library-website-gets-first-facelift-in-5-years/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/library-website-gets-first-facelift-in-5-years/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/library-website-gets-first-facelift-in-5-years/","id":2447,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[2446,2445,2444],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

The district as a whole registered around 9,600 more people this year than in the 2012 election.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista voter registration drives set a new record during the last week of October, registering over 13,000 new voters for the November election. Approximately 11,000 students were registered in 2012 and 10,800 were registered in 2010.</p>\n<p>UCSB leads other universities such as UCLA, which reported approximately 10,100 registered voters, USC, which registered a mere 411 students according to The Daily Bruin and UC San Diego, which reported around 3,000 registered voters according to the UCSD voter registration coalition.</p>\n<p>“They have done a better job of turnout in Isla Vista than I have ever seen, over 13,000 voters voted in Isla Vista today, and it’s because of the very, very hard work of these democrat activists,” Das Williams, supervisor elect, said.</p>\n<p>In Santa Barbara County, 60 percent of the presidential votes went to Secretary Clinton, 32 percent to Trump, 3.5 percent to Gary Johnson and 2 percent were write-ins. California is undeniably a liberal state, so higher voter turnout likely wouldn’t have changed any results here, but in other states voter turnout could have made all the difference in this pinnacle election.</p>\n<p>Millennials proved to be a major force in this year’s election. A photo from SurveyMonkey showing the country’s Electoral College votes if only millennials had voted went viral on Tuesday, with the large majority of them, 473 to be exact, going to Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>Millennials supported Clinton with 54 percent of the youth vote, but many millennials are angry with rumors of thousands of young people writing in “Harambe” on their ballots or even for voting for third-party candidates. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported, “For the Democratic Party to move forward and win, young people — some of the party’s most vocal critics — cannot be shut out of what will be a rebuilding process.”</p>\n<p>The 3rd District County Board of Supervisors had a large turnout of 25,136 votes with Joan Hartmann leading Bruce Porter by 8 percent. The Isla Vista Recreation &amp; Park District had a total of 7,317 votes to reelect Pegeen Soutar as director of the District.</p>\n<p>Measures E and F had an underwhelming amount of voter turnout with approximately 4,150 votes on each measure. Measure E passed with a significant majority of 88 percent, but Measure F, which only 62 percent of people voted yes on, did not pass. If voter turnout had been even higher, perhaps Measure F would have gone through or results for various different offices could have been different.</p>\n<p>Though turnout was strong, an anonymous Campus Democrats volunteer said that word of mouth was that at 6 p.m. on Tuesday only half of registered voters in I.V. had actually voted.</p>\n<p>In 2008, national voter turnout was relatively high at 62.3 percent but dropped in 2012 to an estimated 57.5 percent. This year’s turnout, expected to level around 55.6 percent according to the U.S. Elections Project, shows a trend toward Americans across the country not casting their vote. Reasons for not voting range from being blocked or restricted, being too busy with work and/or childcare, to simply deciding not to vote on principle, according to The New York Times.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, Nov. 10, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74119\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/i-v-leads-effort-as-sb-sees-55-percent-voter-turnout/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74119\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/i-v-leads-effort-as-sb-sees-55-percent-voter-turnout/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/i-v-leads-effort-as-sb-sees-55-percent-voter-turnout/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/i-v-leads-effort-as-sb-sees-55-percent-voter-turnout/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/i-v-leads-effort-as-sb-sees-55-percent-voter-turnout/","id":3913,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[3912,3911,3910],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Legal Code.</p>\n<p>The bill proposed that all gender binary pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers) and accompanying grammar be altered for gender-neutral pronouns (they/them/theirs).</p>\n<p>Senator Elias Jordan got the idea for the bill during a training session when Christine Dolan, associate director of the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), spoke about the importance of society becoming more gender inclusive.</p>\n<p>“We know that LGBTQ people are everywhere, at every intersection of identities, and we know that all oppression is connected,” Dolan says in her Student Affairs biography. “Our liberation is collective, and until we can join in solidarity to challenge racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic and other systems of oppression, we cannot be free.”</p>\n<p>The bill gained student interest after the Senate’s retreat, prompting Jordan to get it passed quickly. He worked at his high school’s resource and counseling center to become more informed on topics of gender diversity and sexuality.</p>\n<p>“I thought this could be a big step forward on a larger scale, considering how prestigious UCSB is,” Jordan said.</p>\n<p>The legislation, which was the first piece proposed by the Senate member, was slowed down because of minor writing issues. It experienced no opposition in Senate.</p>\n<p>Changing an official document to accommodate every person, Jordan said, validates people on campus who don’t feel as if they have a voice.</p>\n<p>UCSB took another step toward inclusivity this summer when the Office of Registrar worked with the RCSGD to update the school’s system so that ACCESS cards, class rosters and faculty interactions with students would change according to the student’s preferred name.</p>\n<p>Pronouns haven’t been altered in the system, but students who identify with a different first name can use it without having to change any legal documents.</p>\n<p>Jordan said he hopes the legislation can prompt both individuals, as well as other institutions, to think about the acceptance of others and the role we as individuals play in that.</p>\n<p>“Depending on how far it could spread, I think we can help people think about the diversity that we have as something to celebrate and not sweep under the rug,” he said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, November 3, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-03/a-s-legal-code-revised-to-include-non-binary-pronouns/","id":2712,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[2711,2710,2709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Joey Alexander Trio: Prodigious","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/57e979d2bf15d.image_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/57e979d2bf15d.image_.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Alexander’s original compositions are simply inspirational.

\r\n</script> \n<p>Born on the island of Bali, Indonesia, Alexander first encountered a keyboard at age six and immediately knew piano was his calling, jazz piano in particular. Not only could he pick up virtually any blues composition by ear, but he could also improvise with a level of experience far beyond his years. In 2014 at the young age of 11, the musical genius was discovered by jazz legend Wynton Marsalis and flown out to New York for Marsalis’s all-star jazz concert at Lincoln Center. From there, his career took off. He’s released two solo albums and been nominated for two Grammys in just the past two years.</p>\n<p>This is Alexander’s first time on the road. He was accompanied by Juilliard graduate and two-time Grammy winner Ulysses Owen, Jr. on the drums and Berklee College of Music alum Reuben Rogers on upright bass. Celesta M. Billeci, executive director of the Arts &amp; Lectures program, introduced the band by simply stating, “I don’t even know how to describe what you’re about to see tonight except: Wow.”</p>\n<p>Greeted with tremendous applause, Alexander opened the show with a classic by John Coltrane called “Calm Down” followed by several original compositions. He received continuous encouragement from bass player Rogers, who periodically yelled out a supportive “yeah!” The trio as a whole was tremendously in sync; Alexander thrives in the syncopated rhythms of jazz. He studied classical music as a child, like the works of Mozart and Tchaikovsky, but always wanted to elaborate on it. Classical music is supposed to be played as written, though; you’re not supposed to embellish. Jazz, however, allows the freedom to express yourself, unlike classical composition, and you can tell it’s what the young virtuoso is meant to be playing.</p>\n<p>His bandmates perfectly complemented him with many impressive solos displaying their remarkable skills on their respective instruments. If you think Miles Teller was good in “Whiplash,” you obviously haven’t seen Owen, Jr. play yet. His hands moved so quickly they completely blurred. Rogers, the “jokester” of the gang according to Alexander, was having the time of his life on stage, yelling out and swaying with the music.</p>\n<p>Now, if you like music — which I assume you do if you’re reading this article — you’ll like Alexander’s original compositions. They’re simply inspirational. It’s more than just genius in its arrangement, it’s the notion of a 13-year-old following his dream and truly succeeding. Every silence and pause was precise and intentional. It’s the kind of music that makes you feel deep down in your core. It makes you want to get out of your seat and cheer, cry and grin. Many audience members shook their heads in disbelief. After the first piece, the woman to my left let out a quiet “Wow,” one you could only hear if you were sitting directly next to her. Everyone was thinking the same thing.</p>\n<p>After the show, Eleanor York was more than excited to share her thoughts about Alexander’s performance. “It was phenomenal. The way everyone played off of each other and with each other; it’s amazing for anyone, let alone a thirteen 13-year-old,” said York, who has followed Wynton Marsalis as a frequent patron of the Arts &amp; Lectures events for years and knew when Joey got his endorsement he was someone to look out for. “It was just delicious.”</p>\n<p>It’s hard to think of a word other than “adorable” to describe the pianist, but gifted will undoubtedly suffice. When he speaks, though he is not completely fluent in English, he is humble and compassionate. It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Hans Christian Andersen: “Where words fail, music speaks.” While Joey’s English may not be the best, he certainly makes up for it with his music. His sound and soul are much older than 13 years, and when he plays you forget about his age. This was evident in the <em>two</em> standing ovations he received.</p>\n<p>I was left with only one question at the end of the night: is Joey good for a 13-year-old, or is he just good? I think it’s safe to say he’s just good.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

hosted a 48-hour cyber security contest on Sept. 16 known as Capture The Flag (CTF), and UCSB’s team, Shellphish, came out in the top ten of all United States teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group is comprised of Andrew Dutcher, Caitlin Scarberry and Brandon Dutcher. Originally a brainchild of UCSB Hacking Team, Shellphish was founded by UCSB professor Giovanni Vigna and is one of the oldest continually active CTF teams in existence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve always been super into computers and started programming them around the age of 12 just making games and stuff,” Andrew Dutcher said of his start in hacking. Andrew Dutcher and his friends attended a hacking competition at Carnegie Mellon University during their junior year of high school, and he said, “we ended up winning, somehow.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yan Shoshitaishvili, a senior member of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shellphish and a computer science graduate student, had similar beginnings in hacking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been working with computers since I was eight, but got pulled into actual hacking in high school by hacking around with my friends,” he said. “I went to the DEFCON computer security conference held in Las Vegas every summer and was completely hooked after that.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In CTF, students perform numerous challenges to test their cyber security skills. Easier challenges can take as little as 10 minutes, while more difficult tasks can take up to 18 hours.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CTF events occur all over the world every weekend, but Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) is the largest student-run cyber security event in the nation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CSAW features six competitions, keynote presentations, workshops and an industry fair. Students range across all different ages and experience levels from high school students to doctoral candidates. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the seemingly daunting task of 48 hours of competition to solve intense cyber security challenges, the common sentiment among both organizers and participants of CSAW is that it’s a fun event for people interested in cyber security.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“CTF is really just a puzzle game for security professionals to practice their skills in a controlled and fun environment,” Andrew Dutcher said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To expand the reach of the competition to gain worldwide impact, CSAW this year partnered with NYU Abu Dhabi and the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasir Memon, professor of computer science and engineering at NYU, founded the competition 13 years ago when cyber security was still a burgeoning field of work. He said that, today, young minds are needed to address the vulnerabilities in rapidly expanding technology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think security is an interesting discipline, because it’s more than just technology,” Memon said. “It’s a psychological problem, a business problem, a policy problem, a legal problem. We need to have the right minds in the discipline.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, there have been over one million cybersecurity job openings just this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While expansion of these skills may be key to finding work in the increasingly competitive job market, for the members of Shellphish, it’s just a fun way to hang out with friends while learning about hacking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christopher Thompson, third-year computer science major at NYU with a specialty in cyber security, is the lead organizer for the Capture The Flag event. He said it is “extremely important” for people to know that cyber security programs such as CSAW are making an effort.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Going through this competition is the equivalent to earning a degree in computer security; having the CSAW name behind a person gives them a lot of validity,” Thompson said. “We’re trying to get companies to realize the talent that’s available while also giving people something to challenge themselves and have fun with.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 15 teams which have outlasted preliminary competitions will advance to finals in New York from Nov. 10-12. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about Shellphish’s shot at winning CTF finals, Andrew Dutcher said they were “almost zero” due to the graduation of much of the original team. He said, however, that “regardless of if we win or not, the next step is to keep improving … There’s always room to grow and get better.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memon, too, is remaining optimistic about UCSB’s chances. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think [UCSB] will do well,” he said. “You have a good team; you’ll place high.”</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Correction: Shellphish placed in the top ten of United States teams, but did not receive first place. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73189\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73189\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-16/ucsb-hackers-advance-in-worldwide-competition/","id":2457,"author":{"id":101,"name":"Allison Garfield"},"related":[2456,2455,2454],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/101"}},"__N_SSG":true}
