for many graduate students’ choice to extend their degree is whether or not they will receive additional funding. </span><em>Max Abrams / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But some graduate students are saying that it is unclear how many students — faced with the cost associated with an extra year of study — will utilize this offer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s just hard to get a sense of where people are at and it’s also hard to get a sense of how your research is impacted,” Alexander LeBrun, Vice President of Academic Affairs for the Graduate Student Association (GSA) and representative to the Graduate Council, said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Graduate Council is allowing three additional quarters for time-to-degree and time-to-candidacy, no additional funding is guaranteed, according to the </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18opTv7ABHar4PsMKTCg2AI0tkMKMlIeZ9Amxp8yPPuw/edit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAQ sheet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the extension was offered to every graduate student, the Graduate Division expects “many, if not most, students will be able to meet their milestones and complete their degrees following the normal timelines,” according to the FAQ sheet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, LeBrun says it’s “hard to quantify” how many students could take advantage of this extension but hopes it will benefit those experiencing </span><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-05/as-in-person-research-goes-dormant-ucsb-researchers-explore-new-methods-of-work/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a halt to their research</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and other facets of their graduate study because of the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Mostly, I’m thinking of people who work in labs,” he said. “There’s only a handful of labs that are currently open, and those are the essential, and also COVID-related, labs. And soon we’re going to be opening a couple more [labs], but that doesn’t account for enough graduate students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The year-long extension will also not apply to graduate student housing, which LeBrun says is already “not prioritized” by the university. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If there’s too many grad students and not enough housing, it seems like we’ll just have to find stuff in the community,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a third-year Philosophy Ph.D student, LeBrun doesn’t do field research or work in a lab, but said that the humanities and social sciences are still impacted by the pandemic and that those graduate students may need more time to complete their degree. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even me, who just sits at home and does my research, I’m being impacted,” he said. “My mental health is impacting my ability to do my research. It’s so hard to concentrate on arcane, philosophical questions.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest determining factors for many graduate students’ choice to extend their degree is whether or not they will receive additional funding –– which LeBrun says remains uncertain for many due to budget limitations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the “time extensions will allow students to maintain funding eligibility,” according to the Graduate Division FAQ sheet, the time extension “[does] not guarantee an availability of additional funding.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding for graduate students, determined either by their department as teaching assistants or research assistants, covers their tuition and health insurance, and provides a salary, LeBrun says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s no guarantee to get funding for that next year. It’s up to either your department if you’re a TA, or your advisor if you’re in research whether they have the resources to pay you.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LeBrun worries that some graduate students who have no choice but to extend their degree will be forced to take out loans if they don’t receive additional funding from departments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s only a limited number of TAships for each department and if you have to give one to a student who has extended their time-to-degree, then that means another student doesn’t get that TAship,” LeBrun said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securing funding and housing, in addition to completing their degrees, are stressors to graduate students, who also take on the role of instructors as TAs –– a role that has only grown more difficult since the start of remote learning, LeBrun said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the vote to extend degree timelines, LeBrun says GSA has just been doing “damage control” to help graduate students. Recently, GSA diverted all graduate student fees –– normally used for events during spring quarter –– to a </span><a href=\"https://gsa.ucsb.edu/covid19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 relief grant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, providing over $30,000 of relief to students who are particularly impacted, according to LeBrun. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m hoping that a system will be worked out where there’s a pot of money for those [graduate students choosing to extend] to continue to get funding, or at least reduced tuition or something like that.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-94805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-94805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/ucsb-grad-students-receive-extended-degree-and-candidacy-timelines-but-funding-remains-uncertain/","id":1,"author":{"id":234,"name":"Madeline Thompson"},"related":[0,-1,-2],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Faculty Association Issues Letter Advising Against the Use of ProctorU Testing Services","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2020-03-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0471.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The student information ProctorU collects and releases to third parties also includes fingerprints, faceprints, voiceprints and retina scans.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a </span><a href=\"https://cucfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ProctorU_2020-1.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">letter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sent to UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Henry T.

future physicians fight a common affliction in doctors: burnout. </span><em>Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to its </span><a href=\"https://professional.ucsb.edu/certificate-medical-humanities#ready\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the new Medical Humanities Certificate provides students with a “foundation in humanities which can lead to increased empathy, more understanding of historical and social contexts of disease, and a better resiliency to burnout.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Jason Prystowsky, the certificate coordinator, said the program quickly came together after a “year of strategic planning.” He explained that he and his colleagues saw a need for humanities in the medical field, for the benefit of both pre-medical students and their future patients. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s kind of an existential threat, almost, of young professionals who have an incredible command of the science and technical expertise and are brilliant and creative but don’t understand the power of narrative or social context, or how poverty is related to health,” he said</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prystowsky said the certificate is well-designed to compliment pre-medical students’ schedules, and it gives students the freedom to pursue sub-specialties of the humanities that interest them and relate to their career goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To obtain the certificate, students must take two extension courses in the fall and spring quarters, in addition to ten units of approved UCSB </span><a href=\"https://ucsantabarbaraextension.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018938314-Medical-Humanities-Electives\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electives</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from various disciplines that relate to the certificate material, according to the website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s not a major, it’s not a minor, it’s a certificate,” Prystowsky said. “So students who have a very robust science and lab schedule can squeeze it in.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fall quarter course for the program, Introduction to Medical Humanities (</span><a href=\"https://enroll.professional.ucsb.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&amp;courseId=31799263\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">INT X410</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), is currently taught by an interdisciplinary team of nine university faculty members, according to Prystowsky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the certificate courses have a different teaching format from the required classes for pre-medical students, the classes use readings and films that are catered specifically toward pre-medical students, Prystowsky said. The curriculum for INT X410 even includes watching an episode of the television series “Scrubs,” which Prystowsky believes offers a great view of popular culture narratives surrounding medicine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We will not give you a book to read or a lecture that does not have the intent of making you a better physician one day,” Prystowsky said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second class, to be offered for the first time in Spring Quarter 2020, is Medical Humanities in the World (</span><a href=\"https://enroll.professional.ucsb.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&amp;courseId=31799270\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">INTX 411</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). The class will focus on how the humanities can be directly applied to the medical field, exploring topics such as spirituality, mortality and structural racism. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Every different community is going to have a different way of looking at health, and a different narrative and have a different historical context,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another goal of the program is to equip future physicians with the ability to fight a common affliction in young doctors: burnout. Part of the spring quarter course, INTX 411, will focus on preparing students to be resilient in their future professions, Prystowsky said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In a lot of ways, burnout is compassion fatigue,” Prystowsky said. “I think having a better understanding of historical context, cultural appreciation, poetry, art and literature, is another tool in that toolbox that young physicians can use to thwart burnout.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Prystowsky said students pursuing the certificate do have to pay for the extension classes — though fundraising for the new program is in progress — students are encouraged to pursue Humanities and Fine Arts (HFA) scholarships to offset costs; a 50% discount was also offered to all UCSB students for INTX 410 this fall, according to the certificate website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A medical humanities curriculum is currently required at 69 out of the 133 accredited medical schools in the country, and Prystowsky believes future medical students will benefit from building a foundation during their undergraduate time at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There is value in giving students exposure to it before they set foot in a medical school campus. We’re planting seeds.” </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 5 of the Oct. 17, 2019 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-89702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ARs like McGreal </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mentor students and colleagues and run labs daily on UCSB’s campus. </span><em>Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academic Researchers United (ARU) obtained signatures from over 2,200 members across the UC campuses for the petition, which were submitted to each UC campus’s respective chancellors’ offices two weeks ago. </span></p>\n<p>“Many [academic researchers (ARs)] are former [postdoctorates] who lost the benefits of having a union when they transferred to an AR position,” McGreal said in an email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ARs like McGreal </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mentor students and colleagues and run labs daily on UCSB’s campus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Neal Sweeney, vice president of UAW Local 5810, explained while academic researchers do much of the same work they did as postdoctorates, they lose the protection of UAW once they transition to titles such as project scientists, specialists, professional researchers and coordinators of public programs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sweeney, ARU formed in order to extend the union benefits postdoctorates were awarded to academic researchers after they transition job titles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“These new titles were not part of the union. All the gains we had won in our contract for [postdoctorates] like higher salaries, a very good benefits plan, paid parental leave, protections against sexual [harassment] and discrimination, job security </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we lost all of these in the transition,” Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When forming a union, ARU obtained the signatures needed for a super majority and submitted them to the state labor board in September 2018. After some initial delays, bargaining officially began in May 2019 and has been going on ever since, Sweeney said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’re calling on UC to work quickly to bargain a fair contract that will ensure sustainable research careers and a more equitable, inclusive workplace,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond job security and improved pay, ARs are bargaining for protections against harassment and discrimination in the workplace, along with gender equity and inclusion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Especially in STEM fields, which most researchers are in, there’s a gender gap,” Sweeney explained. “Having these kinds of protections, like parental leave for example, has been shown to increase retention of women because women aren’t forced to choose between their career and having a family.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While delaying the contract “might seem to benefit the university,” Sweeney believes that improving the conditions for ARs at the UCs will ultimately benefit the UC more in the long run. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There’s a connection between having better working conditions and doing better work,” he said. “When people feel more secure in their jobs, when they feel like there’s protections from [harassment] and discrimination, when they’re paid at a fair level, they can do better research.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elisa Smith, media relations representative in the UC Office of the President, said the office is “working hard to negotiate a fair agreement with the academic researchers as quickly as possible.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Since this is a brand new contract, it takes some time to reach agreement as we do not have a prior bargaining agreement to work from, and considerable thought and discussion are required in chartering new territory with unique issues,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pg. 4 of the Sept. 26, 2019 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-89565\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Orientation staffers like Parent Liaison Melissa Medina were able to reach out to Spanish-speaking parents on the first day of orientation sessions to let them know of the new program. <em>Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But for the first time, this summer’s batch of orientation programs presented nearly all of the workshops in both English and Spanish. According to Stephany Romero, assistant director of UCSB Orientation Programs &amp; Parent Services, the change came about after she recognized the demand for the full program in Spanish and got to work recruiting department representatives for Spanish workshops.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero assembled the Orientation for Spanish-Speaking Parents Committee with colleagues from various departments, such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the College of Letters and Science, and began the task of translating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We were able to translate a lot of the material that is already in our English orientation into Spanish and quickly find presenters from those offices to do those presentations,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quick turnaround necessary for the program, along with the task of translating, did not give the Orientation Programs office the opportunity for as much outreach to parents and students as they had hoped, Romero said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, she believes the program was still a great success this summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Considering we didn’t advertise a lot, we got a pretty good turnout,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, orientation staffers like Parent Liaison Melissa Medina were able to reach out to Spanish-speaking parents on the first day of orientation sessions to let them know of the new program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of those parents actually didn’t know there was a Spanish parent orientation program and would come hoping they would just be able to understand something off of the English one,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They were so relieved when we approached them and let them know.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina, a fourth-year sociology and comparative literature double major, enjoyed working directly with the Spanish-speaking parents for most of the two-day sessions, as she could personally relate to their questions and concerns for their new students.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As a [first-generation student] from immigrant parents, I was able to give them my experiences of what it’s like being a student in the university,” she said. “I think that really helped them feel more comfortable with their students coming.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the goals of parent orientation is to encourage students and parents to create an open line of communication about academics, Medina said. Giving Spanish-speaking parents this same opportunity is equally as important, she added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I would give parents genuine stories of things I wish I would’ve been able to speak more to my parents about,” Medina said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transition to college can be especially hard for first-generation students and their parents if they have no experience with universities, Medina emphasized. She said something as simple as giving Spanish-speaking parents a translated list of campus resources helps them feel more comfortable about the university their children are attending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What a lot of us don’t realize is the university is such a foreign space for people who haven’t experienced it, and it can seem very intimidating… I know now that if these parents have information, they’re able to support their students and be here for them, provide them with resources and answers and let them know they belong here.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of the program is personal for Romero as well, who, as a first-generation alumna of UCSB, has a background similar to those of the students she helps with the Spanish parent orientations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I came to this school, and I was also [first-generation],” she said. “And I know that if my mom had known some of the information that we have provided to our parents now, my experience here would have been 100% different because I would have had the proper support.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Romero said this program will allow Spanish-speaking parents to support their students in ways that other parents have already had the opportunity to; parents now have knowledge of campus resources to be able to answer questions that students might have regarding academics because they had the opportunity to communicate with department representatives directly at orientation, according to Romero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For me, it’s a major deal they get the same information the other parents are getting so that they’re as well informed,” she said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medina said she and her co-workers also received a lot of support from staff of the English-speaking program, who along with other UCSB staff were excited to see the Spanish events taking place and “would always hang around or peep into the presentation[s].” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the translated material established and ready to go for future summers, the program aims to expand advertising efforts and add more department presentations to its schedule and possibly even work with the other UC campuses and their orientation programs, according to Romero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Anytime I see a parent, I envision my mom and the happiness she would get to not only be given information, but to be seen as a normal human being, not just some foreign person,” Romero said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“They are present, they also need help and they are also parents trying to support their child.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
