It’s about unity, it’s about showing strength, it’s about believing that together,” Bogdanov said, “We can build a better community for all of us, for future generations of students.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov said he urges people to join IVTU’s movement and reclaim I.V. from unethical landowners.</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe in fair and equitable housing rights and opportunities for all,” Bogdanov said. “I want you to see that together we can really make it and we can really build a powerful movements and we can really, as tenants, reclaim Isla Vista from the, quite frankly, scummy landlords that are taking over our town; that are taking over your town.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted IVTU president Andrey Bogdanov stating his belief in “fair and negligible housing.” Bogdanov actually said “fair and equitable”.

Some of the committees on campus that were reported on include the Arts &amp; Lectures Advisory Committee, the Student Resource Building Governance Board and the Student Health Advisory Committee.</p>\n<p>According to the report, some changes being discussed include the possibility of the Student Resource Building (SRB) Governance Board renaming the SRB to honor retiring Vice Chancellor Michael D. Young. Other changes include the Student Health Advisory Committee’s upcoming notice to students that next year the distance criteria for Gaucho Health Insurance will be extended to include Kaiser Permanente patients within 50 miles, and that the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on Student Housing will release a report of a delay in the opening of the San Joaquin apartment projects.</p>\n<p>Cassie Mancini, second-year history of public policy major and chair of the Senate University Affairs Committee, said Gaucho Health Insurance was a big issue that many students discussed during meetings.</p>\n<p>“The limits of the distance requirement — that’s so prevalent,” Mancini said. “That was such a big issue and I know our committee reps have been pushing for it, so that’ll be good.”<br>\nMancini said another important issue for students concerns work currently being done by the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on the Status of Women and their student representative Danielle Maldonado.</p>\n<p>“Promotion of women and ensuring faculty and professors get promoted as often as men do and increasing women of color faculty on this campus, that’s a great issue that she’s [Maldonado] really pushing for,” Mancini said.</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, this was the first time A.S. published a shared governance report, in an effort to hold student representatives accountable and to spread the word on new things that are occurring on campus.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said the report can be beneficial for students to know what is happening within administrative and advisory committees on campus.</p>\n<p>“Often there is only one student representative or voice in these spaces, and student participation is critical to fulfilling the mission of shared governance on our campus and throughout the UC system,” Guthy said in an email. “This report is a fantastic new way of ensuring student representation and awareness in all of these spaces.”</p>\n<p>Mancini said shared governance describes the collaborative efforts that are being made between students and staff on campus.</p>\n<p>“The faculty and administrators of the school and students, as well, sharing in university governance and policy-making,” Mancini said. “It’s kind of a concept very unique to the UC system … At the core, it’s like this real sharing of duties between administrators and faculty and we’ve kind of come to have students work with that too.”</p>\n<p>According to Mancini, the report was compiled using feedback provided by student representatives who sit on different committees that were appointed by the A.S. Committee on Committees.</p>\n<p>“We ask the students to be really critical of everything that’s said in the committee and make sure they’re sharing the student perspective because oftentimes in these committees there’s only one student there,” Mancini said. “So it’s super important that the students engage with the committee and really become a member of it to kind of share their voice in the committee.”</p>\n<p>Eve Kopecky, second-year English major and Shared Governance Coordinator for the Committee on Committees, said office hours will be held by the different committees and their representatives at the A.S. Main Office in the MultiCultural Center for students who have any questions about what is occurring on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to get up and going and started to be more proactive about shared governance,” Kopecky said. “So we’re really excited that everyone’s going to have their office hours and be able to just inform people, who they are and what they do.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A copy of the A.S.

Senate meeting propositions a new entrance to the A.S. Main Office and addresses an IRS ruling to pay A.S. Program Board via stipend. <em>Will Tran/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met in the Flying A Room at the UCen last night to discuss potential campus construction projects and issues surrounding A.S. Program Board member payment.</p>\n<p>Among topics discussed during last night’s meeting was a proposal for new construction of the A.S. Main Office, currently located in the MultiCultural Center (MCC), in order to create a space providing easier access for students. In addition, an Internal Revenue Services (IRS) ruling to pay A.S. Program Board members via stipend instead of honoraria was also addressed.</p>\n<p>A.S. President Ali Guthy said her proposal for additional construction to the A.S. Main Office would extend the building to create a new campus entrance.</p>\n<p>“This is not an expansion of the presidential office,” Guthy said. “It’s actually demolishing the Office of the President to create a new entrance to A.S. Main [Office] to make it more accessible for students.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, while there is no money currently underway to be spent on the project until further consultation from all of A.S., she wants to “explore the idea” and has an image in mind for the construction.</p>\n<p>“The idea is to create a huge main entrance next to the ticket office,” Guthy said. “Then we would probably enclose that top balcony area to create more of an office/conference room space, because currently it’s really underutilized.”</p>\n<p>During the meeting there was also an issue regarding an IRS ruling mandated that A.S. Program Board staff get paid through stipend instead of via honoraria.</p>\n<p>Chairman of the Senate’s Finance and Business Committee Jimmy Villarreal said the IRS does not believe the work A.S. Program Board does mandates an honoraria-based salary and that A.S. needs to change the way they are paid.</p>\n<p>“The fact that they have staff that directly supervises them … Program Board is one of the few [groups] that actually has a staff and supervision,” Villarreal said. “So for those reasons and others, the IRS doesn’t want them to be paid through honoraria. Instead we’re going to pay them through stipend, or at least that’s the idea right now.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said there needs to be a change in A.S. Legal Code language regarding how payment is issued to students in student government.</p>\n<p>“I’m actually going to ask some senators … to draft new language for the bylaws to instruct that we are actually managers of our own time and resources,” Guthy said. “That’s a big confusion for the IRS, as they are under the assumption that for stipend-earning students, that we have a staff supervisor.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, although the IRS disagrees, A.S.’s independence justifies the continuation of their specialized honoraria-based salaries.</p>\n<p>“That’s the completely amazing thing about student government is, we are our own bosses and our own supervisors of our own time,” Guthy said. “We don’t report to a staff member.”</p>\n<p>In regard to the Program Board stipend issue, A.S. Executive Director Marisela Marquez said she is looking to further discuss how to pay students in A.S.</p>\n<p>“I am in the middle of a conversation with execs and finance board … to discuss the budget process as well as a new element, which is the stipend class of students,” Marquez said. “We’ll be discussing that a little bit more.”</p>\n<p>External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Melvin Singh also talked about what his office is working on in the coming months, including events and campaigns like Gaucho Consent, which will help educate students about sexual violence. Singh said his office will possibly host a Red My Lips Campaign to bring awareness to sexual assault awareness month in April.</p>\n<p>“The idea is combating the slut-shaming that goes on in regards to gender-based violence,” Singh said. “Basically women are invited to wear red lipstick all week or all month to kind of counter that image.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Thursday, January 15, 2015’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59766\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59766\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-15/senate-proposes-construction-to-a-s-main-office/","id":2994,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[2993,2992,2991],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students Discuss I.V.

Self-Governance Bill. <em>Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Students met in the Associated Students Main Office in the MultiCultural Center (MCC) yesterday to discuss different services that could be helpful to Isla Vista and to develop clearer goals for CA state Assemblymember Das Williams’ self-governance bill for I.V.</p>\n<p>Williams’ Assembly Bill 3 (AB 3) seeks to create a Community Services District (CSD) governance for I.V. which would empower a local governmental board exclusive to I.V. to authorize and execute services and infrastructure projects for the area using locally sourced revenues. Williams’ office is facilitating multiple discussions with different stakeholders, with today’s discussion focusing on capturing student perspectives on what type of services they want in I.V.</p>\n<p>Other issues discussed at the meeting included the role of housing and utility taxes to pay for services, creating a community center and “safe space” in I.V., altering community policing and creating bicycle lanes on the streets.</p>\n<p>A.S. External Vice President of Local Affairs and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk said he thinks that while specific services like a community center or underground facilities could be helpful in I.V., it is important to focus on the long term future and explore how a CSD will be sustained moving forward.</p>\n<p>“For me, the big picture here is [that] even if I think it’s a realistic approach, we’re not going to get all these services at one time. There just isn’t enough money in the world for that,” Schunk said. “But what we can do is prioritize a few and say that these are the most important to us and from there what we can do is really create a system that will benefit those in the long term.”</p>\n<p>One of the concerns raised at a prior stakeholder’s meeting last week was that AB3 was coming from Williams and his office without enough contribution from students and other I.V. residents.<br>\nBut according to Ashley Kruzel, a State Assembly field representative for Williams, since Williams’ office is facilitating the bill and because it has to go through the legislative process, it must come from Williams’ office or CA state senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s office, as she represents Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“Das can introduce a bill, I can’t introduce a bill, you can’t,” Kruzel said, “It has to come from Das or Hannah-Beth because obviously no one else gives a shit about Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>During the forum at the MCC, Schunk discussed the potential of implementing utility taxes in a future CSD-type of self-governance for I.V. as opposed to implementing a property tax. With a utilities tax, I.V. residents would be able to see exactly what they are being charged for instead of unknowingly increasing the overall cost of living without transparency, Schunk said.</p>\n<p>“I think that for a lot of people [a utilities tax] will provide that transparency that people are looking for and I think that a lot of people would desire [it] as opposed to property tax that may be a little bit more elusive,” Schunk said.</p>\n<p>EVPLA office member and second-year Chican@ studies and history of public policy double major Alejandra Melgoza said she wants to convince students that these taxes could be beneficial in the long run.</p>\n<p>“I think that’s really important, because how are we going to tell students, ‘This is what’s going on. Self-governance is going on and your utilities are going to go up,’ plus tuition’s going up,” Melgoza said, “so we just have to find an effective way of making them see like, this is going to help long-term.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he believes students should consider the perspectives and needs of long-term residents when thinking about changes to the community.</p>\n<p>“I know there’s a lot of antagonism between students and long-term residents and I just want to remind everyone … that they are people, that they have lives and families like you, that they have hopes and dreams like you do,” Schunk said. “The one thing I want to encourage everyone to do is try to see them as people and try as hard as you can to really connect with them on a human level because you’d be amazed at how similarly they see this place to you.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said that having an open discussion on self-governance with every constituent of I.V. is vital to ensuring optimum success with the proposed bill.</p>\n<p>“I think the most important thing though is that we don’t let this become a students versus others kind of debate,” Schunk said. “I think moving forward, if students can keep in mind, that we owe it to this community to be members of the community. Then I think we’ll have much better dialogue also.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: This article originally stated Alejandra Melgoza is a second-year Chican@ studies and political science double major. However, Melgoza is a second year double majoring in Chican@ studies and history of public policy.]</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59689\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59689\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-13/students-discuss-i-v-self-governance-needs/","id":4803,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[4802,4801,4800],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Talks Guns, Concert","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Associated Students Senate met Wednedsday night in the Flying A room of the UCen to discuss a resolution to divest from firearm manufacturers as well as denial of transportation to this Saturday�...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p></p><div id=\"attachment_58576\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58576\" data-attachment-id=\"58576\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-20/58550/senate-will-tran/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SENATE-WILL-TRAN.jpg?fit=1280%2C848&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1280,848\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"SENATE WILL TRAN\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SENATE-WILL-TRAN.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SENATE-WILL-TRAN.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SENATE-WILL-TRAN-1024x678.jpg?resize=888%2C287\" alt=\"Senate reviewed divestment after receiving a letter from a father of a victim of the I.V. shooting.

This resolution calls for Senate to get the University of California Board of Regents to develop a plan to divest university funds currently invested in gun manufacturing industries by May 2015 and to execute this plan by December 2015.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics and accounting major Sydney Chanu read a letter on behalf of Bob Weiss, father of May 23 Isla Vista shooting victim Veronika Weiss. In the letter, Weiss condemned the alleged connection between the UC and gun manufacturers. </p>\n<p>“As parents of a victim of gun violence murder at University of California, it sickens us that the university could be invested in firearm manufacturers,” Chanu read, “With over 30,000 gun related deaths every year, and school shootings occurring almost monthly, the gun industry has blood on its hands.”</p>\n<p>Weiss also stated that it is vital students take a stance against gun violence as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>“University of California should act as a leader and ban investments in the gun industry,” Chanu read, “me and my wife ask you to divest now.”</p>\n<p>Campus Democrats president Krishna Hammond also spoke in support of the bill and said students should investigate the amount of investments the university has tied in gun manufacturing industries.</p>\n<p>“It’s unconscionable that not only could we be financially tied to the gun industry that is directly responsible, but also that we don’t even know how much money were in the hole is,” Hammond said. </p>\n<p>Hammond also said students should urge the UC Regents to reevaluate their values in regard to where they invest their funds. </p>\n<p>“Frankly, it’s unimaginable that the Regents and the administration seems to operate as a Black Ops,” Hammond said. “[They are] invested in extremely negative industries and endeavors. I’m just here to help and ask all of you to vote to divest.”</p>\n<p>In addition, DJ Club president Easton Konn said A.S. misinformed him about A.S. Ticket Office logistics, resulting in the club’s denial of funds for transportation to their Waka Flocka Flame and IAmSu! concert at the Earl Warren Showground this Saturday.</p>\n<p>“I would’ve been happy using A.S. Ticketing. I think it’s a great system. I had no issue with it, neither did anyone in my organization,” Konn said. “The only issue is we were never told that we had to use it. We were actually told the opposite.”</p>\n<p>According to Konn, without A.S. funding for buses he will have to deny thousands of students transportation to Saturday’s concert. </p>\n<p>“It’s just really upsetting right now because we have a thousand people on the line, depending on these buses,” Konn said. “I have no idea how to go to all these kids tomorrow and tell them that they can’t get to this concert. I don’t know how to tell them they don’t have buses.”<br>\nSenator and Chairman of the Finance Board Jimmy Villarreal said miscommunication occurred between the DJ Club and A.S., but that regardless he did know if A.S. should fund the buses at all. </p>\n<p>“The initial presentation was basically, ‘Well we don’t want all these kids drunk driving, so let’s get a bus for them.’ We’re paying for those buses,” Villarreal said. “Do we want to be kind of complicit with all these drunk kids going somewhere in the first place? That’s just a lot of liability that maybe we don’t want to be a part of.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This article mistakenly stated the meeting took place on Tuesday, though the intended day was Wednesday.

(<em>Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Members of the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) were in attendance during public forum of the Associated Students Senate meeting last night to combat a bill that would reduce S.C.O.R.E.’s decision-making authority regarding the planning of the Student of Color Conference (S.O.C.C.), shifting authority instead to the External Vice President for Statewide Affairs.</p>\n<p>S.C.O.R.E. is a campus organization that advocates for the rights for students of color and other underrepresented communities, and S.O.C.C. is a UC Students Association conference held this past weekend at UC Merced in which students discuss, among other topics, issues surrounding race. The controversial bill will be headed to the External Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow night to be voted on.</p>\n<p>Second-year global studies major and S.C.O.R.E. outreach coordinator Allison Bettencourt said the bill unfairly shifts the ability to organize S.O.C.C attendance to the EVPSA office.</p>\n<p>“First of all, it’s my understanding that it would be pulled out of S.C.O.R.E.’S jurisdiction to organize and put into the EVPSA’s,” Bettencourt said. “I believe that this is wrong because S.C.O.R.E. has historically organized the Student of Color Conference delegation.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and global studies major and S.C.O.R.E. member Leilani Riahi said the commission has always served minority students and that putting power in the hands of a non-minority would be detrimental to the students of color community.</p>\n<p>“The people in S.C.O.R.E. have always been there to serve this one purpose,” Riahi said. “They’re doing it for others. I know these people, I’ve seen them, worked with them to be elected to this space. You have to have communities of color in mind. Always. We’re already so marginalized, we already don’t have enough power in these fucking institutions, and to institutionalize racism … just give us this conference.”</p>\n<p>Bettencourt also said there was a lack of diversity on campus and that it is important to keep the power within the S.C.O.R.E. to compensate for the imbalance.</p>\n<p>“I believe our school has the least diversity of any other school and because of that, it is more necessary and pertinent than ever that the Student Commission on Racial Equality continues to organize this,” Bettencourt said. “I believe that this Student of Color Conference falls directly under the mission of S.C.O.R.E. which is to educate people about the issues that affects students of color and to organize around those issues.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58250\" style=\"width: 579px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"800180484\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58217\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58250\" data-attachment-id=\"58250\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/senate-discusses-s-c-o-r-e-bill/as-senate-by-kenneth-song_for-11-12-2014-7778/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=1200%2C817&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,817\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1415834446\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"98\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"AS Senate by Kenneth Song_for 11.12.2014-7778\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?fit=888%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58250\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778-1024x697.jpg?resize=569%2C386\" alt=\"(Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)\" width=\"569\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?resize=1024%2C697&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?resize=250%2C170&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AS-Senate-by-Kenneth-Song_for-11.12.2014-7778.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-58250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>(Kenneth Song/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Second year pre-biology major and S.C.O.R.E. diversity educator Kyron Covington said it is essential that students of color organize S.O.C.C attendance and quoted Malcolm X, stating that “only a fool would let his enemy teach his children.”</p>\n<p>“I’m here to condemn the proposed bill to take S.O.C.C away from S.C.O.R.E. because I would be a fool to let it happen,” Covington said. “For people that are new to these issues or ideas of social justice and problems that affect my community, I won’t let anyone else teach them because I know my community best. S.O.C.C. is organized by students of color because we would be fools otherwise.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Anumita Kaur said that if the bill is passed and the committee created to choose S.C.O.R.E attendees is occupied by Caucasian students, it would contradict the purpose of S.C.O.R.E and their conference.</p>\n<p>“This five person committee y’all are suggesting could be all white, besides these S.C.O.R.E. co-chairs,” Kaur said. “It’s never acceptable for a majority white board to organize who gets to go to the Students of Color Conference.”</p>\n<p>EVPSA Melvin Singh said he is not in favor of this bill, at least not in the current language it is written in.</p>\n<p>“I think the conference bill, the language needs to be clarified,” Singh said. “I think people are getting the misconception that I for some reason want to take over these conferences, that’s not what’s happening. I’m personally opposed to anything that takes power from any AS entities, like that’s not what I envision that bill to be.”</p>\n<p>A version of the story appeared on page 4 of the Nov. 13, 2014 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

According to Williams, the roundtable ended with an “overwhelming consensus” that campuses must do more to protect students.</p>\n<p>Jackson said the rate of sexual violence on college campuses is “unacceptable,” citing that one in five students are estimated to be the victims of sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“Nothing has really been done, at least effectively, to address campus sexual violence,” Jackson said. “[I’m] mad as hell about this situation … This is simply unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, Williams has made extensive efforts to address sexual violence on campus by developing the two-part roundtable discussion with his committee and by co-authoring a legislative bill that calls for more action from college campuses to address sexual violence.</p>\n<p>“We really need to address this problem through education, prevention, deterrence, treatment and action,” Jackson said. “Those who are found to have violated what is I think … is simply an appropriate code of conduct need to have drastic steps taken to punish and discourage that behavior going forward.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she is in support of legislative efforts toward ensuring that those who sexually assault individuals are rightfully prosecuted.</p>\n<p>“Yes needs to mean yes,” Jackson said. “We can no longer accept a culture that excuses rape, that condones rape, that protects rape or sexual violence anywhere, let alone on our college campuses.”</p>\n<p>One heavily discussed topic during the roundtable regarded the process by which non-UCSB student perpetrators are currently dealt with and how that process can be improved. According to Associate Dean for Student Wellness Angela Andrade, the university may look at cases where non-students are sexually assaulted or harassed, but can only administer punishments to UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“We look at those cases and see if there’s anything we can do, but ultimately … our campus regulations [only] gives us the authority to discipline students that are enrolled at UCSB,” Andrade said.</p>\n<p>Benjamin Partee, the Dean of Educational Programs at Santa Barbara City College, said that while SBCC does not have their own police team to enforce anti-sexual assault policies, the college maintains good communication with the SBCC Office of Student Life, Isla Vista Foot Patrol, the Santa Barbara County Police Department and UCSB Police Department.</p>\n<p>“I believe we’re going in the right direction as two entities that have individual students in Isla Vista,” Partee said, “and it’s our hope that we can help eliminate the assaults.”</p>\n<p>Katie, a UCSB student and sexual assault victim who chose to withhold her last name for personal reasons, said her experience working with the university was entirely positive, in terms of academic accommodations and understanding her options, but that problems arose along the way.</p>\n<p>“My real issues didn’t start until the investigation got underway with law enforcement,” Katie said.</p>\n<p>Katie said she made the report because she did not want to be one of the many victims of assault who do not have their case heard. However, Katie said she encountered “a lot of insensitivity” in the way IVFP dealt with her case.</p>\n<p>“It was just a process of re-victimization,” Katie said. “I feel like I went through way more pain than I needed to and had to tell way more people my story. Things don’t get to a hearing because there are so many reasons that people are discouraged before having a chance to get to there.”</p>\n<p>UCPD Lieutenant Mark Signa said that sometimes officers working with sexual assault and harassment victims fail to handle the situation out of a lack of understanding and experience.</p>\n<p>“We need to continue to work on that training and to make an effort to build that relationship and improve our abilities to work with the survivors of these assaults,” Signa said. “It’s an ongoing process, we’re not perfect. We’re trying to do the best we can. We need to do better.”</p>\n<p>Jackson said she applauds progress made to combat sexual assault and harassment cases on campus, but that they are only beginning and that more serious punishment for perpetrators are in order.</p>\n<p>“[Students] are going to be our leaders in the future, and if we cannot do that then we have failed the university,” Jackson said. “We will have failed our young people, both men and women, and we will not be doing our job.”</p>\n<p>Jackson also said she feels frustrated that, despite years of activism, not enough has been done to establish a “culture of no excuses.”</p>\n<p>“There’s no excuse for rape. There is no excuse for blaming the victim and there is no excuse for not supporting the victim and prosecuting … whether it’s the criminal context or whether it’s in the university,” Jackson said. “Someone who commits rape should not be a student at the University of California and should not be a student at Santa Barbara City College or any of our schools of higher education.”</p>\n<p>A version of the story appeared on page 1 of the Nov. 13, 2014 print issue of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58206\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/seeking-solutions-to-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58206\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/seeking-solutions-to-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/seeking-solutions-to-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/seeking-solutions-to-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-13/seeking-solutions-to-sexual-assault/","id":2969,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[2968,2967,2966],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The bill was created earlier this year and was first presented to the Senate last Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The bill details the function of the new A.S. Campus Student Advocacy Unit to “provide free and confidential peer support, advice, and assistance to any student, student organization, or student group involved in a dispute with any entity within the University community.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Garcia said the idea for the bill arose when fourth-year sociology and psychology major and A.S. President Ali Guthy expressed concerns about the structure and operation regarding the OSA.</p>\n<p>“The concern regarding the current structure and operation of the office was ultimately this: if the Student Advocate General is meant to advocate for the entire student body as a whole, how can the elected individual, properly advocate for the rights of the whole student body when only dealing with on-campus issues such as plagiarism and dormitory write-ups?” Garcia said in an email.</p>\n<p>Guthy said that while the OSA conducts specific casework for individual students who encounter disciplinary problems on campus, there could be a better way to serve all students.</p>\n<p>“This type of individualized service is not offered by any other elected executive officer or their staff, considering there are alternative structures within the association that serve to facilitate this need,” Guthy said in an email. “As executives, I believe it is the responsibility of our offices and ourselves to advocate for all UCSB students as opposed to assisting with individual cases because we are elected by the entire student body.”</p>\n<p>Second-year CC] literature major, SAG candidate and current OSA outreach coordinator Ethan Reul said that without casework, the OSA would operate like an “umbrella” for other advocacy groups and would be saddled with additional responsibilities.</p>\n<p>“The SAG would then be responsible for the oversight and management of all these advocacy groups as well as kind of advocating on a more university-wide level as opposed to just the on-campus issues that the OSA currently deals with,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>Guthy also said this new CSA unit would settle in with other advocacy units on campus and broaden the spectrum of student support, which already includes the Legal Resource Center and the Isla Vista Tenants Union.</p>\n<p>“The new unit this bill seeks to create, Campus Student Advocacy (CSA), will fit perfectly within this structure as the CSA would conduct casework to assist students who receive on-campus violations,” Guthy said in an email. “The formation of the CSA would create a holistic approach and structure for advocacy in associated students, as the ‘Advocacy Units’ would now address housing issues, off-campus issues, and on-campus issues.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, this bill would better serve students because it would provide a more cohesive relationship among groups on campus striving to help students.</p>\n<p>“For me, the biggest reason is that this bill proposes a new model that will facilitate a more positive, synchronized relationship between the SAG and now multiple advocacy groups, specializing in different aspects of student rights,” Guthy said in an email.</p>\n<p>Fourth-year CCS literature major and former SAG Bailey Loverin said the new bill could take the OSA “five steps backwards” from when it was previously restructured.</p>\n<p>“The new unit will not have the administrative clout of the OSA under the SAG, the SAG will be reduced to a figurehead position, confidentiality could be seriously compromised, you can’t guarantee non-partisan chairs so students could feel unsafe going to the unit, you can’t force them to attend office hours and meetings, the list goes on,” Loverin said in an email.</p>\n<p>Reul said Guthy had initially brought the bill to the OSA, but after the OSA decided not to split the office, Guthy went ahead and presented the bill to the senate. While there was some debate between the two, it ultimately met with compromise.</p>\n<p>“Ali went ahead and decided that she wanted to present it to senate anyway. Technically, it was a professional courtesy that she brought it to us; she did not need to,” Reul said. “However, because she did, we were kind of put off by the fact that she went ahead and did it anyway. So we kind of got into a bit of a heated argument with her and we came to the compromise of postponing, rather than completely eliminating or going through with the bill.”</p>\n<p>Reul said he would support the bill if it were more closely examined and revised, particularly after a new SAG is elected.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping that when we do have a Student Advocate General, [they] work more closely with Ali on the creation of this bill so that way when it finally does go through, it’s in the best interest of Associated Students and the student body as a whole,” Reul said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Attorney General Hector Contreras said the bill in its current form could be deemed unconstitutional according to the A.S. Legal Code and that it would be best to wait until a new SAG is elected before going forward with the bill.</p>\n<p>“If the bill were to be passed as it is now, under my interpretation it would be unconstitutional because it is preventing the Student Advocate General from providing oversight and direction to their office as there is no current elected SAG,” Contreras said in an email.</p>\n<div

divided into multiple sections, such as Activate, Rock &amp; Skate, Motivate and Jubilate, that each provided different activities and booths. The event is inspired by the <em>ciclovias</em> street festival held annually in Bogota, Colombia to help relieve traffic congestion and celebrate cycling.</p>\n<p>SB Open Streets volunteer Diana La Riva said she helped with the pre-planning of the event by calling in more volunteers and handing out flyers, as well as setting up the Donation Station, which accepted donations to help fund the event.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

we encourage people to be active outdoors and enjoy our beautiful weather and to commune, work together as a community, meet new people, slow down the pace of life a little bit.”</p>\n<p>La Riva also said that besides South America, Los Angeles has also been doing their own version of <em>ciclovias</em>, where the streets are closed down and remain open for just bikes and people.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got it put together. Once you have one, then you know how to better do it next time,” La Riva said. “It started in other places and so Santa Barbara’s trying to take it on.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57406\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57406\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-27/santa-barbara-hosts-second-annual-open-streets/","id":3460,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[3459,3458,3457],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Students, Companies Connect at Fall Career Fair","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Career Services held the first day of its Fall Career Fair yesterday at Corwin Pavilion, with a second day open only to science, technology and engineering students, open today.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_57287\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57287\" data-attachment-id=\"57287\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/career-fair_will-tran_for-10-22-2812-2812/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Career-Fair_Will-Tran_for-10.22.2812-2812.jpg?fit=1600%2C1007&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1007\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1413977960\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Career Fair_Will Tran_for 10.22.2812-2812\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Career-Fair_Will-Tran_for-10.22.2812-2812.jpg?fit=250%2C157&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Career-Fair_Will-Tran_for-10.22.2812-2812.jpg?fit=888%2C558&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57287\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Career-Fair_Will-Tran_for-10.22.2812-2812-1024x644.jpg?resize=500%2C315\" alt=\"UCSB students and potential employers alike dressed to impress at Wednesday’s Career Fair.

Will Tran/<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>Career Services held the first day of its Fall Career Fair yesterday at Corwin Pavilion, with a second day open only to science, technology and engineering students, open today.</p>\n<p>The fair, which happens every quarter, features a slew of national companies such as Yelp, Target, Microsoft, SolarCity and Oracle, along with local companies such as Raytheon and AppFolio. Although the event is free for all students, alumni are welcome with a nominal fee paid two days in advance.</p>\n<p>According to Career Services counselor Molly Steen, the fair usually attracts a turnout of about 600 to 800 students.</p>\n<p>“It’s a good number of students that come through and take advantage of this,” Steen said.</p>\n<p>Annie Phung, a fourth-year communication major and member of business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi, one of the fair sponsors, said her organization has been busy trying to promote the event by passing out flyers, posters and making announcements. She said the fair is a good opportunity not only to come into contact with potential employers, but to gain employment-seeking skills.</p>\n<p>“You just come and talk to people,” Phung said. “It is also good practice for them to look professional; to communicate on a casual, yet professional level with employers face-to-face.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Feria, a fourth-year sociology and Spanish double major and member of Teach for America, said she is excited be on the other side of job hunt, helping students get career experience.</p>\n<p>“There is so much potential in all these students, and the fact that I was on the other side last year and I’m helping them now is so amazing,” Feria said. “You can tell the difference between somebody who takes the initiative to bring a resume, somebody who takes the initiative to have everything clean and somebody who takes the initiative to really stand out is really great.”</p>\n<p>Alumna Kristie Reynolds, who represented Macy’s, said there are certain steps students can do to improve their chances of landing a job.</p>\n<p>“Be prepared,” Reynolds said. “Definitely look up all the companies that are going to be at the career fair that you’re interested in. I think you need to know what positions that they have available … and know what you want to go into and be prepared with the experience that you have and how to sell yourself at the career fair.”</p>\n<p>Electrical engineering major Daren Jing said he focused on writing a good resume to get an internship for electrical or computer engineering. He said the career fair makes the job search easily accessible for all students.</p>\n<p>“This [is] good because I can talk to those people, those employees and learn more about their company,” Jing said. “I don’t need to go online and search [for] each company. It takes a lot of time, but here, I can talk to each [person] and hand out my resume.”</p>\n<p>Reynolds said students will learn about the career options they’ll have during and after college.</p>\n<p>“I hope that they’ll get good experience in learning how to network and find out what’s out there for them and how UCSB can really help them develop their careers after college,” she said.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 14 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57286\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57286\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/students-companies-connect-at-fall-career-fair/","id":2986,"author":{"id":168,"name":"Rachel Ann Reyes"},"related":[2985,2984,2983],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/168"}},"__N_SSG":true}
