Hell no.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On Thursday, May 25, Pollock Theater’s Trans Media series program screened “Tangerine,” the movie most widely known for being shot on an iPhone 5S. It’s Christmas Eve, and Sin-Dee (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) has just been released from prison only to find out that her boyfriend, Chester (James Ransone), left her for another girl. To find out the truth about this rumor, Sin-Dee and her friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) journey through the diverse areas of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>The film feels very authentic with the way in which it captures Los Angeles. The use of the iPhone 5S helps show the setting in a more down-to-earth manner. Everything appears as if it were captured in the moment, instead of being modified to look more perfect in post-production. The unrestricted nature of using a smartphone instead of a large camera benefitted the production of this film, as there were shots that would not be done in a traditional filmmaking set because sound or lighting equipment would interfere with the reflection or flow of a shot.</p>\n<p>The acting is another factor of the film that made it such a realistic experience. Most of the people involved in the film were not big names, but the possibility that they actually live in Los Angeles made their performances feel more genuine than if it were to be done by any Hollywood actor. Most of the supporting cast are the various people Sin-Dee and Alexandra meet during their odyssey across Los Angeles. They all play some part in reflecting the general themes of friendship and connectedness in the film. The performances don’t even feel like actors reading lines; they feel like normal people causally living their lives which are captured by director Sean Baker’s crew.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>While Rodriguez was excellent in her role as Sin-Dee, Taylor stole every scene she was in as Alexandra, which is what made me highly anticipate the Q&amp;A session that was held after the screening between Taylor and Patrice Petro, director of Carsey-Wolf Center and Film and Media Studies Department professor.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained how she got the role through Baker, who approached her while she was talking with a friend outside the Los Angeles LGBT Center because he wanted to draw real-life experiences for the film. Taylor was the only one helping him, and he liked her personality, believing that she fit the character of Alexandra best. In actuality, Taylor, a trans woman, was very insecure during the time she was in production for “Tangerine” because she had just transitioned.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_78260\" style=\"width: 1285px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"590552921\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"78259\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-78260\" data-attachment-id=\"78260\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/tangerine/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?fit=1275%2C742&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1275,742\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"tangerine\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?fit=888%2C517&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-78260\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=888%2C517\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?w=1275&amp;ssl=1 1275w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tangerine.jpg?resize=1024%2C596&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-78260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Film Society of Lincoln Center</p></div>\n<p>She explained to Petro that she wanted to take her personal life completely away from her when becoming Alexandra. The character was confident, so Taylor used the experience she had in “Tangerine” to make herself as confident as the character she was portraying.</p>\n<p>This confidence that Taylor gained remained with her even after the release of the movie. Ever since, Taylor has become a vocal activist for the LGBT community. The purpose of UCSB’s Trans Media program is to “showcase contemporary media work in television, narrative filmmaking, and critical documentary in an effort to explore the relationship between sexual orientation and gender identity outside of a rigid binary view of the world,” according to the Carsey-Wolf Center website.</p>\n<p>Taylor explained to Petro that she felt like an advocate for trans women. Taylor illustrated this notion by recounting her personal life. She was rejected by jobs because her I.D. stated that she was still a man even though she considered herself  transgender. She explained how random strangers she met were much more accepting than her own family members. She wanted to live a normal life, and even though “Tangerine” gave her that opportunity, she still thought of those who didn’t have the same chance as she did. She explained how some people could get rejected so many times that they could resort to drugs; it was all a domino effect. She didn’t want to be selfish about her success and wanted to help others instead. With the money involved in her job, she noticed how she was moving up the ranks, and she looked to the people still on the streets. She noted how it was difficult to get out of this kind of situation, so she wanted to open up to that community more.</p>\n<p>However, even as an actress, she still faced being stereotyped by Hollywood. When Taylor was first doing auditions, her manager offered roles of a victim. These roles were associated with Taylor either playing a prostitute or someone who was killed in the film. As she went to more colleges and found more LGBT students, she realized that an entire community of people were viewed in one restricted way. Fortunately, Taylor began to work under a new manager, who got her into roles for the short films “Diane from the Moon” and “Happy Birthday, Marsha!”</p>\n<p>So, should “Tangerine” be only recognized for shooting on an iPhone 5S? Hell no. While the film itself was completely different from other films I have seen, it was the context surrounding this movie explained through Taylor’s Q&amp;A session that made the film feel much more unique and important.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78259\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78259\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-06-01/actress-of-tangerine-brings-new-perspective-to-trans-media/","id":5782,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5781,5780,5779],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Extravaganza ’17 Coming to Harder Stadium Sunday","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Previews: What's Going On","publish_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"UCSB’s A.S.

Program Board will hold its 38th annual Extravaganza festival this Sunday at Harder Stadium all day, from 1-7 p.m., with headliners Schoolboy Q, Tinashe and GRiZ.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For its almost 40-year run, Extravaganza has been highly popular among students at UCSB. The festival originally consisted of mostly local musical acts. However, as the event started to rise in popularity, various famous musicians came to Santa Barbara for a slot in the event. Some of the more notable musical acts in the past few years were Drake in 2010, Kendrick Lamar in 2013 and Rae Sremmurd (who only got to play at the concert because it wasn’t shut down early) just last year. Apart from big-name artists, the festival also brings in lesser-known names in music to provide smaller-scale performances to the audience. Chance the Rapper came to Extravaganza in 2014, two years before he caught the attention of the public with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coloring Book</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Anderson Paak performed last year before he was recognized by the Grammys with a nomination for Best New Artist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though I have listed mostly rappers as examples of musical acts, A.S. Program Board has, in actuality, brought musical artists from a wide array of genres ranging from rock to hip hop to electronic. With this variety of genres, this spring festival has become so popular it has even been sponsored by many corporations. Last year’s Extravaganza was sponsored by StudentUniverse, Guayakí and KIND Snacks. Despite it being a popular concert, there were many criticisms concerning opening the doors to those who were not UCSB students. Because of this, as well as rising costs, A.S. Program Board made Extravaganza exclusive to UCSB students only in 2011.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point, the Program Board decided to include two stages. However, the idea was cancelled in 2005 to make way for bigger-name acts. To mark the event’s 29th anniversary, Program Board decided to shift the time of the festival from day to night. So on May 16, 2009, the gates opened at 3 p.m., and Ludacris, the headliner for that year, ended his act at midnight. A high-quality screen was placed nearby the stage to let the back rows see the acts better. At some point, A.S. Program Board even asked people to submit short films that would be played between musical acts.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, here’s some practical information for the day of the festival.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_71022\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"729527655\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77972\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71022\" data-attachment-id=\"71022\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-16/45-ejections-11-arrests-at-extravaganza/extravaganza-by-stephen-manga-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg?fit=800%2C533&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,533\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Extravaganza 2016\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-e1463653993701.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-71022\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Extravaganza-by-Stephen-Manga-11-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-71022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nexus File Photo</p></div>\n<p>To accommodate the large-scale setup of the event, Extravaganza takes place at Harder Stadium. The stage is located at the center of the stadium. There will be both student and professional vendors on either side of the stadium that will serve food, as well as an info booth that will sell merchandise. Students will be seated on the bleachers of the stadium. The following will be prohibited at the festival: objects such as glow sticks, fireworks, lasers, skateboards, bottles, cans, knives, alcohol, illegal substances, wallet chains, recording devices, backpacks, large bags, hula hoops and projectile items; and actions such as stage diving, crowd surfing or moshing. If a student is caught violating these rules, they will be removed from the event.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Artsweek and the entire UCSB campus received news of the first three artists playing at Extravaganza, two more supporting acts were announced: Twin Peaks and Thundercat. Cadien Lake James, Clay Frankel, Jack Dolan and Connor Brodner make up Twin Peaks. They formed their band and went out on a tour during their senior year of high school. In fact, their first album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunken</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was cheaply created to pay for any gas or beer on the road. The album caught the attention of Autumn Tone Records, which released it in the summer of 2013. Their decision to drop out of college proved a good choice for them, as their second album, which they began working on after making this decision, was successful. Croom joined the band on the keyboard for their third album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Down in Heaven</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which drew inspiration from the 1968 works of the Rolling Stones, The Kinks and The Beatles. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other artist announced is Stephen “Thundercat” Bruner, a bassist who has worked with artists in black vanguard music. As a member of a musically talented family, Bruner’s music career began when he joined the band Suicidal Tendencies in high school. With an interest in the L.A.-led movement of black genre-mixing music, Bruner began to work with many different creators. The most prolific turn in his career came when he began working with Flying Lotus for 2010’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosmogramma</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Some of the more well-known songs he was featured on were Childish Gambino’s “II. Shadows” and Kendrick Lamar’s “These Walls.” Bruner’s own first album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Golden Age of Apocalypse</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was released on August 29, 2011, with a favorable reception from the public. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Spring Quarter nearing its final weeks and the school year coming to a close, Extravaganza will most likely be a large event that will attract many students anticipating this spring festival A.S. Program Board spent countless hours preparing for.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77972\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/extravaganza-17-coming-to-harder-stadium-sunday-2/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77972\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/extravaganza-17-coming-to-harder-stadium-sunday-2/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/extravaganza-17-coming-to-harder-stadium-sunday-2/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/extravaganza-17-coming-to-harder-stadium-sunday-2/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/extravaganza-17-coming-to-harder-stadium-sunday-2/","id":6546,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[6545,6544,6543],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Guardians of Galaxy Vol. 2’ Is Good But Obvious","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Long story short: “Guardians of the Galaxy” was alright.

While I commend Marvel’s efforts to introduce unknown superheroes to a wider audience, the film still fell into the standard, stale Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) formula, once you remove the 80s, “Star Wars” vibe to it. (The movie was basically “The Avengers” in space, without prior “set-up movies.”) Nevertheless, the film was also so fun and bizarre, out of all the MCU movies, that I basically assured people that, if handled well, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” could break away from the MCU’s typical mold.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this follow-up was still plagued by standard problems of the MCU. Information was basically spelled out to the audience without any chance for them to connect the dots. In some scenes, information, whether it was audio or visual, was repeated to — I guess — make the scene more emotional, when it actually made it repetitive. There were moments when the music or actors’ expressions could have easily conveyed everything, but the characters just explained it after I understood what they meant or felt. It’s like writer-director James Gunn (or some studio executive at Disney) didn’t think that it was enough for the actors to communicate the information, so lines were written in to reinforce the emotion.</p>\n<p>The film also felt incohesive and clunky. An advantage the original “Guardians of the Galaxy” had is that the completely generic MCU plot at least ran at a consistent pace. Here, the sequel aimlessly meandered for a while until it finally started to pick up near the hour mark (that’s an estimate, though, because you really don’t feel the pace at all). After the climax, it lost too much steam because it went on longer than probably necessary. And, while I liked the general area in which the film ended, I feel as if there should have still been some closure, as it ended in an abrupt manner.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>To be honest, this movie felt like Marvel’s “Return of the Jedi,” because while the structure and other weaknesses certainly weighed it down, it also contained some of the best elements of the MCU overall.</p>\n<p>Even though I believed that most of the main characters did not undergo the most critical development possible, Gunn made up for it with Yondu. Michael Rooker put all of his emotion and dedication into this performance to create a solid arc for his character. The movie devoted some time to interact and form connections with the different guardians of the galaxy. We actually got to spend time seeing Rooker’s emotional conflict and the ways in which he handles it. By the end of the movie, his arc felt complete and satisfying. In a film with five main characters, the one you end up empathizing with the most is one of the side characters.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77775\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"694483757\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"77774\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-77775\" data-attachment-id=\"77775\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/guardians-of-galaxy-vol-2-is-good-but-obvious/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?fit=2048%2C1975&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1975\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"guardians of the galaxy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?fit=250%2C241&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?fit=888%2C857&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-77775\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy-250x241.jpg?resize=250%2C241\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=250%2C241&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=768%2C741&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=1024%2C988&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-77775\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of KCSR</p></div>\n<p>As I was watching the movie, I kept thinking about how great the marketing ended up being for this film. Even though I heard about one character’s role in the comics, the trailers and posters led me to believe that Gunn was giving his own interpretation of the character that fit in the context of the film. As the plot unfolded, however, the movie completely subverted my expectations. For the first time since “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” I was completely taken off guard by one of the MCU’s movies.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this was not the only factor that indicated to me that this movie had strong elements to it because the villain was actually decent. One could tell that Gunn most likely restrained himself when writing this movie, as he made it feel more small-scale and (thankfully) did not integrate Infinity Stones or any other broad MCU plot device into the plot. This proved beneficial because the movie did not rely on anything seen (even if it was for one frame) in past MCU installments to make the movie stronger. Also, while the villain’s motivation was external (in fact, you see it affecting other people), the plot’s central conflict was fixed between the guardians of the galaxy and the villain. In fact, while “Awesome Mix Vol. 2” did not play as big of a role, the song chosen to play during one instance of this conflict heightened my emotional response to that scene overall, as the heroes were already given a drive to want to defeat the villain.</p>\n<p>Because of this change of pace, I could feel this film trying to break away from the MCU formula, as it, at the very least, still felt strong if taken out of context from the cinematic universe. While the first movie had more flow, this sequel felt more daring. Even though its plot did meander before kicking into motion, this sequel did not feel like it was stalling for time until the release of the new Avengers movie, “Infinity War.” Instead, it focused on a specific storyline for the remainder of the film. Additionally, the best part of this movie is that it still had a specific function in the larger MCU story, despite feeling so distant from it.</p>\n<p>This is a case in which the amount of positive elements outweighed the negatives and gave the movie a pretty good final result. Even though we are deep into the hold of the MCU, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” felt like a much-needed breath of fresh air. Though I found this film to be uneven and overly simplified at times, I also believe Gunn tried his hardest to distinguish it from the rest of the MCU. I just hope that “Spiderman: Homecoming” and “Thor: Ragnarok” try to break the Marvel formula when they arrive later this year.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77774\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/guardians-of-galaxy-vol-2-is-good-but-obvious/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77774\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/guardians-of-galaxy-vol-2-is-good-but-obvious/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/guardians-of-galaxy-vol-2-is-good-but-obvious/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/guardians-of-galaxy-vol-2-is-good-but-obvious/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-11/guardians-of-galaxy-vol-2-is-good-but-obvious/","id":6110,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[6109,6108,6107],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Schoolboy Q Set to Headline Extravaganza 2017","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-05-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/schoolboyq_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/schoolboyq_.jpg?resize=948%2C533&ssl=1","description":"Listed below are the artists who were confirmed to be performing musical acts at this year’s Extravaganza this afternoon at Storke Plaza.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Run by A.S.

Collaborating with actor Robert De Niro on works such as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, the duo consolidated their strong director-actor relationship early on in their careers. This collaboration lasted well into their respective careers — their big collaboration film of the ’80s is the now-classic Raging Bull.</p>\n<p>Based on the real-life story of boxer Jake LaMotta, Raging Bull recounts various fights and life events that marked the rise and fall of the renowned boxer. On Thursday, April 20, UCSB’s Carsey-Wolf Center hosted makeup artist and UCSB alumnus Michael Westmore to discuss the making of the movie with film and media studies professor Anna Brusutti.</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A discussion after the screening of the film, Brusutti remarked that one of the main themes in the film is the idea of violence. During the first match of the film, Scorsese hints at the violent nature of the boxing matches that will influence LaMotta’s personal life. In the first boxing match alone, the hectic nature of the event suggests that the audience demands to see this violence for their own enjoyment. At the beginning of the film, the audience already knows that LaMotta has a violent side as he displays a verbal attack (and small physical one) toward somebody early on the film. While a montage later in the film can be interpreted as a passage of time, it could also suggest a part of his life when his violent nature began to slowly build inside in context of this theme, as suggested by the various fights interlaced into the sequence. Ultimately, Scorsese also proves that violence is an endless cycle that can influence others to act similarly.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Most of this is demonstrated through LaMotta’s personality and De Niro’s portrayal. As a character, LaMotta is brutal in the ring yet controlling outside. It’s almost as if Scorsese is trying to make the point that LaMotta was a product of a society that wanted him to beat people mercilessly to gain acceptance from them. As a result, LaMotta exerted complete control over those he loved, as demonstrated when he questioned any time his second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) kissed other men as a form of greeting or remarked that someone was simply good-looking.</p>\n<p>While LaMotta’s character on paper would be enough to show this change, it was De Niro’s dedication to the role that made the finished performance more meaningful. Westmore remarked, “[De Niro] trained so thoroughly that trainers were saying, ‘He could actually go into the ring [and] he probably would win.” While it is commonly accepted for actors to fully dedicate themselves to a certain role such as weight loss, Westmore reminisced on various times when De Niro would want the most minute parts of his character to be as accurate as possible.</p>\n<p>In one aspect of filming the movie, De Niro wanted his hair to look like LaMotta’s instead of wearing a wig. Westmore explained spending hours trying to rearrange De Niro’s hair to look as accurate as possible. For one scene, Brusutti noted a discontinuity in the flow of the scene which involved confetti. Both Scorsese and De Niro wanted to keep the confetti on LaMotta’s face, and the scene ended up taking 10 days to shoot because Westmore had to put confetti on De Niro’s face every shoot.</p>\n<p>While De Niro’s performance helped note the certain points of LaMotta’s life that led him to a violent path, the sound in the film was used well to make audience members hear the impact of his destructiveness. One can hear all the punches hit, as the sound is what can give audience members the reaction the movie wants them to have. In one scene involving LaMotta’s brother slamming someone’s head with a car door, one does not see the person affected by this action. However, with the sound, one can clearly picture the possible image in his or her head.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is the makeup that not only shows the brutal effect of the violence on screen but also traces LaMotta’s life through the 23 years used to account his rise and fall. Regarding its use of violence, one can see the effect the punches in the ring have on a boxer. Westmore explained how he used tubes on De Niro’s face for the bloody punches. Even though the film is shot in black and white, the showcasing of blood is still effective for the plot of the movie, as there is little color contrast as suggested by Westmore at the discussion, and brings about a more poetic style to the scenes.</p>\n<p>However, the makeup is also used for the most subtle details in the film. Westmore uses it for smaller moments, such as the makeup done to LaMotta to show his roughness and Vickie to show her purity. He also uses his skills in makeup to create front cast-ons to make De Niro appear older than he is. Westmore explained that the real LaMotta’s skull was thicker than most men’s.</p>\n<p>At the time the film was released, Westmore had tried to bring makeup to the forefront. Westmore was given a special Oscar for his efforts in this film. A year after this film was released, the Oscars created the “Best Makeup and Hairstyling” category. In addition to the screening and Q&amp;A, some of the makeup work and props used for the film were on display, such as notes for “Sugar Ray” Robinson, makeup and three prosthetic noses.</p>\n<p>Westmore even explained to the audience that Raging Bull was more of a documentary, as there were people involved in the real events who helped inform the cast and crew of what actually happened. Indeed, it’s no wonder that UCSB’s Carsey-Wolf Center wanted to screen this film, additionally inviting Westmore, who provided audience members insight into the process of filmmaking through his personal experiences.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77378\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77378\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/raging-bull-takes-on-violence-with-movie-magic/","id":5827,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5826,5825,5824],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Edge of Seventeen’ Showcases Realistic Teen Angst","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/edge-of-seventeen.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"With her character’s personal problems well established, Steinfeld is able to convey the struggles experienced by average high school students, showing passionate emotions on screen.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>High schools can be portrayed in an exaggerated manner in the entertainment world. The distinct, contrasting colors and clean faces from director John Hughes’s work or Netflix’s recent teen drama “13 Reasons Why” create romanticized ideas about a campus atmosphere that, by most people, is not actually experienced in reality. On Thursday, April 13, UCSB’s Pollock Theater presented a Script to Screen for director Kelly Fremon Craig’s 2016 film “The Edge of Seventeen,” which portrays high school slightly more honestly.</p>\n<p>This film follows Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) as she tries to navigate her junior year of high school. Various conflicts or situations involving her brother (Blake Jenner), her best friend (Haley Lu Richardson), a few classmates (Hayden Szeto and Alexander Calvert and one of her teachers (Woody Harrelson) arise and help her break out of her introverted, envious personality to become a more open-minded person.</p>\n<p>With her character’s personal problems well established, Steinfeld is able to convey the struggles experienced by average high school students, showing passionate emotions on screen. Craig attended a Q&amp;A discussion that occurred after the screening, and a part of the filmmaking process she extensively talked about was casting and working with the actors, especially Steinfeld. Craig explained that little touches, such as a look or an aside, really distinguished Steinfeld from many other actresses of her age. This was so special to Craig when considering how stressful the casting process was for her up until Steinfeld came to audition.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“I spent a year seeing it and thinking … I don’t think we can make the movie because we just can’t find her,” Craig explained to Pollock Theater director Matt Ryan during the discussion.</p>\n<p>With regards to the supporting actors in the film, Craig seemed to have an easy time working with them, whether this was their first film or one of many projects.

That’s so much better,’ so I never want to step on that moment. I ended up not doing a lot of rehearsal.”</p>\n<p>This work mentality displays the good results that come about when actors and directors collaborate well with each other when making the film.</p>\n<p>Craig illustrated the complexity of these characters when Ryan asked her about any advice she would give to aspiring screenwriters. She explained that thinking about how the film would be if a side character was the main character can provide you with a perspective on what they want. “A lot of times, when you’re writing those peripheral characters, it’s easy to just think about whatever you’re trying to accomplish with the main character [with] these people helping you with it,” she explained. She talked about how imagining them as the hero is important to make them more complicated.</p>\n<p>It is important that the characters be this intricate and complicated because the actor’s delivery and expressions are crucial to having the audience truly feel the message of the movie. Given the setting, the message of the film is relatable to anyone who has ever been through high school. The idea that students believe they know everything about people and think they are alone is a problem that can mentally affect them. There are students who may feel as if they do not belong to a certain graduating year or group of friends because of assumptions they build up about their peers.</p>\n<p>Craig explained how this theme tied back to Nadine’s character arc, saying, “Particularly at that age, you can really feel like that’s the truth, and then you start to realize that everybody in the world is carrying some sort of pain. Everybody’s been through something tough regardless of how they present [themselves].”</p>\n<p>While the film does have a central message it wants Nadine to realize, Craig also uses moments in Nadine’s arc to address other problems or illustrate tropes associated with the current generation’s high school environment.</p>\n<p>Certain turning points in various relationships Nadine has with other supporting characters are also executed while showing a certain contemporary idea. For example, the film deals with the modern issue of sexual assault in high schools. When shooting a scene involving this topic, Craig had a conversation with the two actors involved before filming it because she wanted to be as honest about the situation as possible. She wanted to show the scene in such a frank way because she believed “if you’re tiptoeing or you’re awkward it just makes the whole thing awkward.” Indeed, to address a problem this tragic, one would not want to shy away from depicting the moment.</p>\n<p>Craig clearly showed both passion and dedication to this project, going so far as to spend six months in a high school to truly capture the spirit of the modern teenage environment. “The Edge of Seventeen” brought a fresh new look into a genre of films that have been known to have many clichés attached to them.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77154\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77154\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-20/edge-of-seventeen-more-realistic-than-13-reasons/","id":5826,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5825,5824,5823],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Logan’ is a Movie for the Comic Books","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Even though “Logan” faltered in its second half, it is still one of the more enthralling comic book movies to come out recently, as the first half alone transcends the comic book genre.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Ever since his first appearance, Wolverine has been one of the most beloved characters in the X-Men film franchise. Actor Hugh Jackman has played this part so well that his version of the character has become a very recognizable pop culture icon in recent years. Now, after eight movies, he will end his long run as the well-known superhero in his final film as the mutant hero, “Logan.”</p>\n<p>It’s the year 2029, and mutants have been nearly extinct. Wolverine, or Logan, has lost his healing ability, and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has been affected by Alzheimer’s, which has left him unable to fully control his powers. They are on the edge of the Mexican border, working to eventually live a better life, when they accept the calling of a woman who wants them to escort a young girl, Laura (Dafne Keen), across America to the Canadian border.</p>\n<p>Despite developing over the course of the franchise, Jackman’s character undergoes the fabled hero’s journey as if his character is just being introduced to us. By placing huge limitations on his mutant powers, Wolverine feels different from how he was in past installments, as tension for his life slowly begins to rise. While it is slightly helpful to understand Logan’s relationship with Charles Xavier in past films, one does not need to know any specific events of previous entries to follow this film’s plot. It almost seems as though director James Mangold approached this story as if the other X-Men movies never happened.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Because of this, “Logan” distances itself from all previous X-Men installments tonally and stylistically, as it earns an R rating. Apart from bloodier action scenes and more profanity, Mangold uses this opportunity to create a more mature movie. The themes and mood reflect this, as the setting is not as colorful as it was in the franchise. The cinematography and costume design suggest a harsher world, where the threat from the enemy is worse than ever. With this setup, Mangold tries to break apart from the comic book genre to make something entirely different. Despite having great action scenes, the best moments of the movie were the simple character moments that the MCU movies typically don’t care to include. Sharing themes with the stories “Children of Men” or “The Last of Us,” the comic book elements are seamlessly integrated into the film, as the movie doesn’t feel remotely like a “comic book movie.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76316\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"239781688\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"76314\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76316\" data-attachment-id=\"76316\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/logan-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"logan\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-76316\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logan-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-76316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Flickr Creative Commons</p></div>\n<p>That is, until the second half.</p>\n<p>Up to this point, the film was nearly flawless. There might have been a few technical issues and some slight over-acting from Patrick Stewart, but perhaps I was just nitpicking at the movie. However, the film truly does reach a climax, because the film starts to falter right after its best moments. The pacing starts to drag, and major plot elements slowly become sillier. In the first half, the film felt like a neo-Western that simply included four mutants, as it relied on the various character arcs and interactions instead of “comic book elements” to progress the story forward. With the introduction of a younger Wolverine clone, the increased inclusion of Dr. Rice (Richard E. Grant) and his plan involving mutant children, the film started to take a dive back into being a comic book movie. The second half isn’t completely awful; it’s just that the first half had such a perfect balance that it set high expectations for the rest of the film.</p>\n<p>However, because of these expectations, even the smallest falters made the film appear more unbalanced, as the comic book elements became very present. As more characters were introduced, the film started to become overcomplicated. With these sudden inclusions, the film removed some of the realistic, serious undertones that the first half was spent building upon. The biggest strength of the first half was that there was almost a complete lack of superpowers used in a superhero movie. Even then, the mutant powers fit the mood that the film set for itself. But as the film went into the second half, it seemed as if characters and scenes were written into the script just so the film could make other major moments happen. If the screenwriters did a few more tweaks, they could have still gotten to these moments while staying true to the tone they set for the film. The characters established in the first half could easily hold the movie on their own. Those who appeared in the second half could have just been mentioned, and the film would have worked just fine.</p>\n<p>Even though “Logan” faltered in its second half, it is still one of the more enthralling comic book movies to come out recently, as the first half alone transcends the comic book genre (as most people are suggesting for the film overall). If the film was strong throughout, then it would certainly be “The Dark Knight” of the X-Men franchise. But as it stands now, it is solely a solid comic book film. While Jackman didn’t end his 17-year run as Wolverine on the best note possible, he sure did end on a great one.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76314\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76314\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/logan-is-a-movie-for-the-comic-books/","id":5831,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5830,5829,5828],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘La La Land’: A Hollywood Story Turned to Cinematic Gold","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14141565_576769935842944_1998357375766171876_n.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14141565_576769935842944_1998357375766171876_n.jpg?resize=960%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Los Angeles is essentially its own living and breathing character, leading the audience to believe that the film is as extravagant as the city itself. ","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although director Damien Chazelle has only recently started his film career with 2014’s “Whiplash”, he has already began creating an impressive streak of great films. His latest feat, “La La Land”, focuses on aspiring musician Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and actress Mia (Emma Stone), two lovers hoping to achieve their dreams in the lively city of Los Angeles. As soon as the words “La La Land” flash onto the screen, the audience is immersed into modern Los Angeles as seen through the lens of old Hollywood.</span></p>\n<p>Because of its focus on Los Angeles life, Chazelle uses very distinct and contrasting colors in every frame to reflect the exaggerated Hollywood productions. Every color, even the most bleak, shine brightly on the screen. Sometimes, the scenes are constructed to look as artistic as possible. As Mia and Sebastian dance in the Griffith Observatory, they are silhouettes dancing gracefully in the stars, capturing the most dazzling moment in their relationship.In another scene, Mia and Sebastian run in from outside, with a beautiful painting serving as its entire background. Los Angeles is essentially its own living and breathing character, leading the audience to believe that the film is as extravagant as the city itself. However, this exaggerated style is layered over a realistic story.</p>\n<p>There is a clear distinction between the romanticized life and the moment when reality starts to settle in for Mia and Sebastian. Whereas most films would put the characters in a situation where they would obviously reunite, “La La Land” questions Mia and Sebastian’s dreams. It asks how many opportunities Sebastian is willing to take even if the results are not entirely what he hoped for, as he would obtain merely fragments of his dream. Mia faces a separate problem, with her career testing her to see how much she truly wants to reach her dream. But surprisingly, the film does not handle this problem melodramatically, as both characters are satisfied with where they are in respect to one another, despite differences in their amount of fame.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This story and the themes are represented by the truly unforgettable songs in this film. Most of them sound like they are taken from an old Hollywood movie, as their instrumentals thump with the heart of jazz music. The dance numbers are very reminiscent of this style, while still integrating dance moves that are more modern. As the story progresses, the songs shift from loud and vibrant to subdued and personal. They both serve as a reflection of a certain point Mia and Sebastian’s relationship, and set the tone for the movie. Even though “City of Stars” has won “Best Song” in most award shows, any song nominated could likely win the award. The unique character given to the songs is also in the score, which is used to create emotion so well that it could easily be confused music not intended for a film soundtrack.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite having only made one film prior, it can’t be too early to predict that Chazelle has potentially found his niche in music movies. This niche has proved successful for him, as “La La Land” took home all 7 Golden Globes it was nominated for, breaking the record for number of Golden Globes a single film has received. Indeed, while the niche of music movies may seem more contained than most reputations, Chazelle has nevertheless shown that he can take different angles on this niche based off his two films. While “Whiplash” was an intense drama about music, “La La Land” is a dazzling modern musical influenced by the large Hollywood productions of the past. With the overly exaggerated, yet impressive, choreography and understated character moments, it would not be surprising if this film was adapted into a Broadway production. Already, “La La Land” is basically demanding to be performed in theater. While “Whiplash” brutally pushed a character to his limits in a near impeccable story, “La La Land” pulls at your emotions to create a wonderful experience.</span></p>\n<p></p><div id=\"attachment_74812\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"470211523\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"74809\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74812\" data-attachment-id=\"74812\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/la-la-land-a-hollywood-story-turned-to-cinematic-gold/golden-globe-graphic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?fit=1800%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1800,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"golden-globe-graphic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?fit=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?fit=888%2C444&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-74812 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic-1024x512.jpg?resize=888%2C444\" alt=\"Grace Clark / Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?resize=250%2C125&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Golden-Globe-Graphic.jpg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-74812\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grace Clark / Daily Nexus</p></div><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Even with this potential loss, there are various creatures Moana and Maui face, which act as a replacement and are more understandable in context of how they are used in the story. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One component that “Moana”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accomplishes out of all the Disney movies is having some of the best balancing of seriousness and humor. While the story itself is strong, the animation is the reason why the film elevates itself from such a stale formula. The animation is vibrant and varying in colors used for the different scenes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The focus of the film is mostly on Moana and Maui, with other characters coming in for brief moments of time. Moana is strong-willed and cares for her people, willing to take any risk she can when setting out on the open sea. Her internal conflict with whether or not she is the right person to embark on this voyage slightly justifies some of the slow pacing caused by the cliche used in the third act. Maui is the typical selfish character changed by the quest he takes with Moana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pair follow the “hero’s journey” story without ever going through any noticeable changes in the end. Despite Moana and Maui fitting into known archetypes amongst other small problems, the voice acting and character animation for them is honestly what made me enjoy them way more than I thought.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the Heights” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda helmed the music for “Moana,” from including authentic Polynesian language to paying tribute to David Bowie. These songs help look into the character’s mentality or tell the story in musical form. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the very best, the songs can sweep audience members into the scene, sending chills down their spine with the bombastic instrumentals and vocals. “How Far I’ll Go” competes with “We Know the Way” as the best song of the film. This song is a more tame, slower version of “Let it Go,” that might rival it in regards to its quality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, most of the best songs are used in the beginning of the film leaving nothing as catchy by the end. But, even the songs that are not as good are still infectious in their own right. They just don’t have as big of a purpose in the film, fit with the tone of the film or aren’t as memorable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People have been claiming that Disney is possibly entering a second renaissance after the critical and financial failure of their films in the early 2000s, and “Moana” is another film that reinforces this idea. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the film “Frozen” was merely a new reinterpretation of this same Disney formula, “Moana” is a vastly compelling execution of this story. While there were stereotypical plot points or characters, the film helped brighten up the plot with beautiful animation and fresh music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, “Moana”</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have been another retread of an established, yet familiar, formula. In all honesty, isn’t that why we were excited for this film in the first place?</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74548\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74548\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-12-05/moana-is-a-vibrant-disney-masterpiece/","id":5853,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5852,5851,5850],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"‘Moonlight’ Glimmers on the Silver Screen","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-17-at-2.08.09-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-17-at-2.08.09-PM.png?resize=967%2C560&ssl=1","description":"For African Americans and the LGBT community, 'Moonlight' is a personal and poignant representation of a queer African American male, a character not commonly portrayed in film, struggling with the ha...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At some point you’ve got to decide yourself who you gonna be.

The change in actors over time is very intricate and a proof of the right casting choices. The discussion of race and sexuality is handled perfectly, as director Barry Jenkins never uses it for a preachy, social justice statement that disrupts the flow of the narrative. Instead, it blends in the background and is used as a storytelling device in showing the realistic nature of Chrion’s internal dilemma. As each chapter ends and another begins, one can feel the effects of the previous chapter seeping into the next one. Every scene builds from the next, as they are placed together to bring about conflict. Amid all the torment and loneliness surrounding him, he is still able to find his own niche by the end and reconcile with those who wronged him. Jenkins does not accomplish this through conventional means such as expositional dialogue. Instead, a simple movement of the camera or timing of the scene communicates the moment and the emotion surrounding it without a single word. While every single shot doesn’t achieve this, the ones that do are such distinct shots that they resonate with the viewer long after leaving the theater.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This film is ultimately a character piece, as the most important part of telling Chiron’s story is all the people who are integral to his journey. Mahershala Ali gives the most vibrant performance as Juan, a drug dealer who sees pity in Chiron and wants to help him. His development is the most noticeable, as he is the first person in the narrative to act kind to Chiron despite what his job might suggest about him. The peak of his story arc puts him in a somber state because of his relation to Chiron’s mother Paula. While actress Naomie Harris’ performance boasts a colorful personality, Jenkins contrasts this later in the story with a mother regretful of her actions in the past and asking for forgiveness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last main component in telling this story is the music. Nicholas Britell’s score is very slow, centered around either piano or violin, which allows each instrument to communicate a different feeling to the audience. While the camerawork and the characters told this story in visual and story-driven way respectively, the music adds an emotional layer to the story. With the exception of moments that use music for its own meaning, the score goes from scattered and detached violin scratches with a melancholy feeling, to the calm piano that emits a somber mood to the flow of a violin bringing about moments of gracefulness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘Moonlight’ is the kind of film that stays present in your mind long after it is over. Even though the film is adapted from the play “In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,” its themes translate to film effortlessly. Though I wasn’t necessarily moved away completely by such a powerful film, I could still respect Jenkins for the way in which this story was told and the themes that were incorporated. And in light of Election Day, this film can stand as a glimmering light for anyone in need. For African Americans and the LGBT community, it is a personal and poignant representation of a queer African American male, a character not commonly portrayed in film, struggling with the harsh world surrounding him. For everyone else, it is a heartfelt story about growing into a complete person with the help of those who come into your life along the way.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74327\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74327\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-17/moonlight-glimmers-on-the-silver-screen/","id":5857,"author":{"id":698,"name":"Ryan Song"},"related":[5856,5855,5854],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/698"}},"__N_SSG":true}
