The main message in the video ad centers on the letters “I.V.” and encourages viewers to keep I.V. safe by giving back to the community and living a life that makes you proud. The ad will be broadcasted on television in Santa Barbara County, Ventura County, Oxnard and San Luis Obispo County and also shared through social media.</p>\n<p>UCSB, SBCC and the city of Goleta each contributed $15,000 for the campaign and the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s office and the sheriff’s department each donated $5,000. I.V. Safe is comprised of government stakeholders and receives $10,000 annually in funding from Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County District Attorney and chair of I.V. Safe Joyce Dudley said the committee’s top priority is to rebrand I.V. and change its reputation.</p>\n<p>“The group said the most important thing is to change the image of Isla Vista,” Dudley said. “To take it away from being the party school where you come here, you abuse alcohol, drugs and the environment and take advantage of people, commit crimes.”</p>\n<p>According to Dudley, the committee is working with film director, writer and branding consultant Ken Berris on the campaign. Dudley said Berris’ daughter attended UCSB and Berris has previously collaborated with the university to create ads during Halloween.</p>\n<p>“He’s working very closely with UCSB and they came up with those Halloween ads,” Dudley said. “Everybody felt for the rebranding it was going to be positive … and those beautiful pictures in the background that were donated, he brought that back to the committee and we all liked it.”</p>\n<p>SBCC trustee and UCSB alumnus Jonathan Abboud said he believes rebranding should be done from the “ground up” by Isla Vistans and not by officials in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“I’m not trying to demean the work of my colleagues … but I believe they made a mistake by not consulting the community,” Abboud said. “This is a very sterile ad, made from people in downtown Santa Barbara who hired a professional consultant to create an ad. That’s why I personally feel like it won’t work, because it doesn’t have that genuine feeling of the town doing it.”</p>\n<p>According to Berris, the ad targets locals in Santa Barbara, as well as students and their parents.<br>\n“The audience is going to be ideally everyone in Santa Barbara County, from students, to parents, to residents,” Berris said. “We want to start spreading this new communication about what we want I.V. to become again.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said the campaign is a “massive misstep” because it does not feature elected Isla Vistans.</p>\n<p>“They could use some prominent Isla Vistans in it and not elected officials and public officials from other cities,” Abboud said. “Maybe some of the younger looking people in the ad who look college-aged are Isla Vistans, but … we have a parks board of five people who live in Isla Vista. We have student elected leadership from A.S. None of them are in it.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said the campaign sets an expectation, and communicates to visitors certain behavior is not condoned in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If people see that’s what I.V. stands for, they’re not going to come here with the notion of destroying and thinking that the community itself is going to support the kinds of activities that have been going on there that negatively impacted public safety,” Dudley said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said few people will be exposed to the ad because many people are choosing mediums such as Netflix and Hulu over broadcasted television.</p>\n<p>“The majority of media consumed in Isla Vista is not through TV and cable TV in the traditional sense,” Abboud said. “A lot of people have transitioned to other sources like Netflix and Hulu, and this ad doesn’t seem like it would reach these people.”</p>\n<p>Alumni Affairs Office Assistant Vice Chancellor George Thurlow said he appreciates I.V. Safe creating the ad, but a brief campaign will not have a large impact on the long-time established I.V. culture.</p>\n<p>“The image and quality of life in Isla Vista have been formed over the last 40 plus years (I lived there in the 70s),” Thurlow said in an email. “A media campaign on local television for one season will help but not have much impact. Having said that, we are appreciative of the District Attorney and Ken’s efforts.”</p>\n<p>According to Berris, efforts to rebrand I.V. will take several years.</p>\n<p>“Where we’re looking at this is year one,” Berris said. “You don’t rebrand a community or implement new techniques in one year. We’re looking at this as a five to seven year campaign.”</p>\n<p>Dudley said she will view the campaign as successful if it decreases the amount of crime and violence in I.V., and if not the committee may have to change its approach.</p>\n<p>“The way I’ll be interested in looking at it is did it reduce crime, did it reduce arrests, did it reduce injuries,” Dudley said. “If it’s during the time when these ads have had effect, then I think that’s terrific. If I’m not seeing a reduction in those kinds of things then I would think about other ways that we might want to redirect that fund.”</p>\n<p>Abboud said he does not believe an ad will convince visitors not to come to I.V. or not to commit crimes during their stay.</p>\n<p>“If your ends are reducing crimes and reducing out of towners, this doesn’t seem like it meets those ends to me,” Abboud said. “I don’t know how an ad reduces crime, and I don’t know how an ad reduces out-of-towners. I think the people who come to Isla Vista to commit crimes are going to come regardless of an ad.”</p>\n<p>According to Abboud, I.V. Safe’s rebranding effort and exclusion of Isla Vistans in the conversation is not only ineffective but also disrespectful to those who live in I.V.</p>\n<p>“No other community would ever have an external government body impose an ad campaign to rebrand it anywhere else in the state or the country, that doesn’t happen,” Abboud said. “It happens very rarely with disenfranchised or disempowered communities and not to respected ones. It shows to me they don’t respect us very much if they’re going to not include us in the conversation 100 percent.”<br>\nDudley said she sees the campaign as a way to show the current status quo of I.V. rather than altering the image of it.</p>\n<p>“I see it as not so much a rebranding, as really shining a spotlight on where Isla Vista is right now,” Dudley said. “For lack of a better word, all the things that happened there have had a very sobering effect on the community. The community has come together where public safety is a high priority for the people that live there.”</p>\n<p>Berris said he believes any community can be rebranded given time and effort.</p>\n<p>“The campaign is essentially the communication tool that lets everybody know that we are changing I.V. back to the great community it was once,” Berris said.</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 in the Thursday, Sept. 17, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Richard Martinez, father of victim Christopher Michaels-Martinez, and Bob Weiss, father of victim Veronika Weiss, both spoke and held a Q&amp;A session at the event to share their experiences since the events of May 23 last year.</p>\n<p>Martinez said, as a member of pro-gun control organization Everytown for Gun Safety, he does not wish to ban guns, but rather to reduce gun-related violence and crime.</p>\n<p>“I grew up with guns … Everytown and me personally, we’re not anti-guns, we’re anti-gun violence,” Martinez said. “I’m not out to ban guns from people who are responsible citizens. I want to make sure as much as possible that dangerous people don’t have guns.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said he wants to ensure criminal background checks are carried out, and improve existing background checks to prevent dangerous individuals from acquiring guns.</p>\n<p>“The most effective thing we can do to end gun violence in this country is to have criminal background checks on all gun sales,” Martinez said. “We have criminal checks on gun sales in California, but we need to do better. We need to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers and people who are seriously mentally ill.”</p>\n<p>According to Martinez, states that require criminal background checks before gun purchases see less gun-related crimes.</p>\n<p>“In states that have criminal checks for gun sales, fewer women are killed with guns, fewer law enforcement officers are killed on duty and fewer people commit suicide,” Martinez said. “The I.V. shooter had a long history of serious mental illness. We need to improve our background check system to make sure that the information gets into the background check.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said studies show while 1,171,177 Americans in total have died from the nation’s past wars, an even greater number of Americans have died due to gunfire, with 1,384,171 recorded between the years 1968 and 2012.</p>\n<p>“PBS commentator Mark Shields made the following statement, ‘More Americans have been killed by gunfire since 1968 than in all the wars in the nation’s history,’ and he made the statement on December 2012,” Martinez said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63567\" style=\"width: 351px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63567\" data-attachment-id=\"63567\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/richard-martinez-shares-his-story-about-how-gun-violence-has-affected-his-life/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431915085\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-63567\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-3.jpg?resize=341%2C227\" alt=\"Richard Martinez shares his story about how gun violence has affected his life.

How has that become acceptable?”</p>\n<p>Weiss said he will attend the UC Board of Regents meeting on May 20 at UC San Francisco to advocate for UC divestment from businesses that produce guns.</p>\n<p>“On Thursday I will be at the Board of Regents meeting at UCSF presenting petitions from students about divestiture,” Weiss said. “University of California is invested in weapons manufacturing. They’re actually taking your money and investing it in companies that make guns. And when I heard about that, I had to get involved.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said since the events of May 23 last year, he has helped pass “red flag legislation” which allows individuals to report cases if they feel threatened by someone near to them and potentially confiscate guns and other weapons from suspects if a judge agrees there may be danger.</p>\n<p>“Red Flag Legislation allows immediate family members or law enforcement, if they believe that a loved one is a danger to themselves or others, they can go take that evidence before a judge and if the judge agrees, the judge can order that the person return any weapons they have and prohibit that person from buying more weapons,” Martinez said.</p>\n<p>Martinez said he hopes to add a checklist in police reports to be completed by officers and deputies in the case of domestic violence or mental stability investigations, and to ensure officials inform those involved of the Red Flag Legislation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we took the second amendment literally, it’s the right to keep and bear arms, each one of us would have the right to keep a tank in our backyard and nobody understands it in that way. – Richard Martinez</p></blockquote>\n<p>“The domestic violence addendum to police reports is a checklist for officers to make sure they did everything in a domestic violence situation,” Martinez said. “I’ve talked to Sheriff Brown about doing a checklist about somebody’s mental stability, and one thing I’d like to have on the checklist is the red flag legislation.”</p>\n<p>Weiss said Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department (SBCSD) should have performed a more thorough welfare check on the shooter on April 30, questioning whether he was in possession of guns.</p>\n<p>“There’s a question in a threat assessment that should be on [Richard Martinez’s] checklist, and according to the FBI they are preventing mass shootings right now by always asking this question,” Weiss said. “This wasn’t asked of the Isla Vista monster; no one asked him if he had a gun. One thing police officers are trained in is having a sense of when someone’s lying to them.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said some gun lobbyists believe a higher power and the second amendment under the Constitution, the right to keep and bear arms, warrant their desire to have a gun anywhere at any time.</p>\n<p>“They feel the second amendment guarantees them the absolute right to carry a gun at any time and any place,” Martinez said. “Some say we have a God-given right. Although I’m not a biblical scholar but … I’m puzzled by that one.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said the second amendment and other rights under the Constitution are not absolute, and there are certain exceptions to the right of possessing weapons.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have absolute right of free speech, you can’t go onto a crowded movie theater and yell ‘fire,’ you can’t threaten to kill somebody,” Martinez said. “You don’t have the absolute right to practice religion — you can’t engage in human sacrifice. If we took the second amendment literally, it’s the right to keep and bear arms, each one of us would have the right to keep a tank in our backyard and nobody understands it in that way.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_63568\" style=\"width: 351px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-63568\" data-attachment-id=\"63568\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/bob-weiss-talks-about-his-professional-relationship-with-richard-martinez/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 70D\",\"caption\":\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1431916025\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"128\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-63568\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Martinez-Weiss-Talk_Stephen-Manga-4.jpg?resize=341%2C227\" alt=\"Bob Weiss talks about his professional relationship with Richard Martinez.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Weiss said he disagrees with gun lobbyists, and the second amendment is not necessarily applicable in modern-day as it was written at a time when newly independent American civilians required a way to defend themselves against the English.</p>\n<p>“The gun lobbyist’s arguments are all bullshit,” Weiss said. “The second amendment — it was written to protect us from the British who were apt to invade our shores anytime because we didn’t have a proper army to take them on. It didn’t have anything to do with protecting yourself from robbers.”</p>\n<p>Martinez said another stance taken by gun lobbyists is to solve gun violence by increasing the number of guns, which according to Martinez is an outdated resolution.</p>\n<p>“The second argument that you hear is that the solution to gun violence in our country is more guns,” Martinez said. “That suggestion is a 1800’s solution to a 21st century problem. We can do better. What the heck are you supposed to do with a gun during Deltopia? It just doesn’t make sense.”</p>\n<p>Weiss said while I.V. is seen as an “idyllic place,” there are several problems, including high crime, in the college town that must be addressed.</p>\n<p>“It’s a beautiful place … everyone’s pretending, ‘Oh, it’s by the ocean and the sun shines and everybody’s happy,’” Weiss said. “Deltopia draws in thousands of high school and college kids. You can’t do that in most cities; you would get shut down a long time ago. This town is a big damn mess, it needs to be cleaned up.”</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major Adriana Marquez-Gallegos attended the talk and said she is in favor of gun safety laws and hopes to look into more legislations against gun violence.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was really informative and it opened up my eyes to gun violence,” Marquez-Gallegos said. “It could have been any one of my friends or myself, and you just never know. I think I would look into gun laws we can pass and more voting.”</p>\n<p>Second-year biology major Scotty O’Brien said he is concerned more gun safety laws will remove the weapons from the possession of responsible entities and contribute to a black market for guns to be accessed by dangerous individuals.</p>\n<p>“While I believe that so-called common sense safety laws can make us less safe, I do recognize that the increased prevalence of firearms in the community results in more shootings,” O’Brien said. “More safety laws mean less people are able to purchase firearms through the legal market. The black market for guns is just like with drugs, just expands and expands and turns into a whole messy organized crime situation.”</p>\n<p>O’Brien said, while decreasing the amount of guns could decrease gun-related issues, it may not contribute to lower violence overall because other types of weapons are available.</p>\n<p>“More guns, same amount of violence, the violence won’t go away — it’s just a matter of how one chooses to defend or not defend themselves,” O’Brien said.</p>\n<p>Martinez said UCSB students and the youth population in general should take a stance on gun violence and promote safety measures that will inevitably affect them.</p>\n<p>“Don’t ever kid yourself that it can’t happen to you. When the I.V. shooter left his apartment, he went out to kill. He had over 600 rounds left,” Martinez said. “So, you have a choice, you can forget about it and go on and continue to enjoy your lives here and pretend it won’t happen again, or you can do something about it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63580\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63580\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-19/fathers-speak-on-gun-safety-control/","id":2757,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2756,2755,2754],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

A.S. Internal Vice President elect and third-year sociology major Kimia Hashemian will be recruiting and appointing two new on-campus senators to fill the positions.</p>\n<p>Three of the thirteen applicants will not begin attending UCSB until the fall and therefore do not yet qualify for the position. Hashemian will be interviewing the remaining ten to select two for the senatorial positions.</p>\n<p>Incoming A.S. officials for the 2015-2016 school year will be sworn into office on May 20, and following that an ad hoc committee will be created to select two new senators to be approved by the A.S. Senate. The three on-campus senator elects, first-year political science major José Magaña, first-year art history major Lacy Wright and first-year economics and political science double major Nawar Nemeh will be sitting in on the interviews with Hashemian.</p>\n<p>Korbas said he was required to resign from the position because he will not be living on campus next year.</p>\n<p>“I’m not actually allowed to have the position because I’m not living on campus,” Korbas said. “I could have moved back to the dorms but I didn’t really want to.”</p>\n<p>Korbas also said he initially ran for on-campus senator position after being encouraged by a friend in the FTP party.</p>\n<p>“My friend told me to join his new party and made it sound like it wasn’t too much work, so I thought why not,” Korbas said.</p>\n<p>Wright said she is unsure about the circumstances surrounding Xie’s resignation.</p>\n<p>“I do not know the full context as to why David Xie resigned, but I am sure that he was doing what he felt was best for him and I support his decision,” Wright said in an email.</p>\n<p>According to Hashemian, the low turnout for on-campus senator candidates during elections may be due to the requirement that on-campus senators must live in residence halls. Hashemian also said some students were applying to be Resident Assistants (RAs) at the time and were not allowed to apply for both simultaneously.</p>\n<p>“For the on-campus senator positions, it is difficult to get many students to run because you have to live in the residence halls again, and most first years are living off campus [next year],” Hashemian said in an email. “Another reason could be that during the same time Senators choose to run is when RA interviews happen.”</p>\n<p>Nemeh said A.S. positions require a large time commitment, and tuition increases going into effect this fall may put a financial strain on potential candidates.</p>\n<p>“A.S. is a time commitment that a lot of students just can’t afford,” Nemeh said in an email. “With the tuition hikes going into place next year, less of us will have time to participate in our governance because we need to redirect our time to paying off our loans.”</p>\n<p>Wright said on-campus senators should adequately represent the various types of students on campus.</p>\n<p>“UCSB is really such a diverse community and I want our senate to represent the diverse ideas and interests on this campus,” Wright said in an email. “I am hoping for someone who is passionate about working to improve this campus.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Elections Committee Chair and second-year political science major Fiona Hayman said student participation in the spring election this year was lower than previous years, and the Elections Committee aims for a greater number of student to turn out next year to participate in A.S.</p>\n<p>“The number of students participating in the election was overall lower than in past years,” Hayman said in an email. “It is hard to put a finger on the reason why less students were involved, but Elections Committee plans to engage in increased outreach and publicity efforts to get more students interested in elections next year.”</p>\n<p>According to Nemeh, on-campus senators should be cognizant of students’ needs and be motivated to make changes.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking for people who want [to] create real, tangible change,” Nemeh said in an email. “The Senate needs students who are willing to go out there and find out what is it that students need.”</p>\n<p>Hashemian said some students are not familiar with A.S. and therefore do not run for positions, an issue she said should be addressed.</p>\n<p>“Most students are not as well informed on exactly what Senate is, therefore didn’t apply. I do believe there should be more effort into recruiting candidates,” Hashemian said in an email.</p>\n<p>“Students should know what A.S. is from the beginning … spring elections should not be the first time students hear about A.S. Senate.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63351\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63351\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-13/a-s-to-fill-posts-after-resignations/","id":2768,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2767,2766,2765],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Guerry Awards Honor Efforts of Community Police","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GUERRY-Cheryl-Sun-e1430993756114.jpg?resize=350%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GUERRY-Cheryl-Sun-e1430993756114.jpg?resize=350%2C280&ssl=1","description":"For their responses to the events of May 23 last year, Santa Barbara Co.

Sheriff’s Department (SBCSO) deputies and UCSB Police Department (UCPD) officers were commended at the 46th annual H. Thomas Guerry Awards Ceremony in the Santa Barbara County Administration Building Wednesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Five SBCSO deputies and three UCPD officers were awarded the H. Thomas Guerry Award for valor at the ceremony and several other local law enforcement officials were also celebrated for superior performance. The prestigious award is named after former Santa Barbara police detective H. Thomas Guerry, who was shot and killed in 1970 by two suspects attempting to rob a bar downtown.</p>\n<p>UCPD Corporal Gregory Pierce said despite the unfortunate circumstances, he is honored to attend the ceremony and hopes to bridge an understanding between the community and the police.</p>\n<p>“We’re all honored to be here, but it’s an unfortunate reason that we’re all standing here,” Pierce said. “But taking a positive attitude, building a relationship with the community and understanding what we do on a daily basis, what we’re capable of doing kind of put some closure to this event for the law enforcement.”</p>\n<p>UCPD sergeant Dan Wilson said community members should take preventative measures and reach out to the police if they have mental health concerns about someone.</p>\n<p>“We really need to work on the mental health aspect in our community, because that’s an epidemic that’s really facing our country right now,” Wilson said. “Usually somebody knows something before it happens, but they fail to report it. And, unfortunately, we’re unable to prevent that from happening.”</p>\n<p>According to Pierce, events such as Pizza with Police, Coffee with Cops and UCSB residence hall programs are a good start to communicating with residents and students.</p>\n<p>“I know that our agency at UCSB tends to do a lot more community outreach,” Pierce said. “We have the res hall liaison program, where officers are assigned to those res halls and they provide information and talks on how to be safe in Isla Vista. That’s definitely one that helps us build those relationships.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said Pizza with Police is important because it “allows [the police] to be human” and allows the community feel more relaxed around cops.</p>\n<p>“They get to know us by name and they can actually feel comfortable approaching us, and that’s kind of breaking down those barriers because a lot of times, people don’t feel comfortable [so] they’re not going to say anything,” Wilson said. “A lot more students are approaching police officers and having a relationship and talking and you can see it by them saying thank you.”</p>\n<p>According to UCPD Corporal Bradley Prows, open communication must be ensured in I.V. because the police exist to serve the public.</p>\n<p>“We are there to serve them so you have to have an open dialogue back and forth that is a healthy exchange of ideas,” Prows said. “I mean if an officer were to tell you they aren’t interested in what you have to say, you’re looking at a fool.”</p>\n<p>Prows said Chancellor Henry T. Yang is bringing in officers from UCLA, UC Irvine and UC Riverside every weekend to maintain safety on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had that every weekend … officers coming in Thursday through Sunday,” Prows said. “There’s been a huge commitment on it on the part of the chancellor to ensure the safety of the community.”</p>\n<p>According to Prows, the argument that there is too much police presence in I.V. has no basis, especially given the string of recent robberies this past week.</p>\n<p>“I think you could have a spirited debate between people saying it’s too much and people who are victims of either nonviolent or violent crimes that would say there’s not enough,” Prows said. “Especially this last week we’ve had three armed robberies, I’d have to argue that we don’t have enough officers.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said he approves of the university’s steps in taking “a bigger interest in the community” by providing alternative events to popular I.V. festivities such as concerts and fairs.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting together on different platforms to try to talk about issues and come up with resolutions,” Wilson said. “I think having different alternatives during these in advance, whether they’re planned or not, like the concerts, places for people to go — it’s the little things that make a big difference.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared in the May 7, 2015 issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Unafraid” in the Theater and Dance building on Saturday to discuss his work as an activist, which will be followed by an art workshop in which attendees can participate.</p>\n<p>Salgado’s talk, hosted by the Research Center of Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD), will explore the challenges he faced as a queer and undocumented man of color in the United States and how those experiences shaped his life. Originally born in Mexico, Salgado moved to Long Beach, California at the age of 12, where he was raised.</p>\n<p>Salgado identifies as an “artivist,” an activist who spreads ideas through art. According to Salgado, he began exploring art as a child to cope with the struggle of language barriers.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been making art all my life ever since I moved to this country,” Salgado said. “I feel that art — especially visual art and drawing — have been a way for me to communicate, especially when I didn’t speak English.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said the hardships he faced helped him realize his passion for sharing ideas through art.</p>\n<p>“My experiences as an undocumented immigrant really shaped what I want to do in my art, which is why I wanted to share some of my experiences through poster work, through comic strips and political editorial cartoons,” Salgado said.</p>\n<p>The event aims to provide an environment for queer students and students of color to feel comfortable interacting with their peers and sharing experiences with one another, according to Salgado.</p>\n<p>“When you are a person of color who’s queer, you have to sort of bring this identity with you, so [I am] creating these spaces for a queer person of color because you feel like you’re not alone,” Salgado said. “There’s this feeling of relief that really takes away the pressure of wanting to show how perfect you are, because nobody’s perfect.”</p>\n<p>Salgado said he appreciates students’ interest in his work, and though people “tend to glorify artists who are dead,” he believes it is important for artists to talk about their own work.</p>\n<p>“A lot of students … were doing their thesis about me and writing about my artwork,” Salgado said. “I’m still alive, I’m an artist, so I should be talking about my work.”</p>\n<p>Richard Moreno, fourth-year communication major and RCSGD graphic designer and marketing coordinator, said Salgado’s talk will address issues faced by the undocumented and queer, or “undocu-queer,” community.</p>\n<p>“Julio’s artivist work within the undocu-queer community made him the perfect guest to host an event for our center,” Moreno said in an email. “Students should attend because Julio Salgado sheds light on a very serious issue facing a community that often does not have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Moreno said he looks forward to learning more about Salgado’s past and current work, as well as participating in the art workshop.</p>\n<p>“I am looking forward to hearing Julio speak about his experiences as an activist in the art community,” Moreno said in an email. “I am also interested in [the] art portion of the workshop as well, even though I am not a very talented artist.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

id=\"caption-attachment-62946\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Northwestern University economics professor Charles Manski gave a lecture titled “Mandating Vaccination with Unknown Indirect Effects” to outline different methods of making public policy decisions regarding compulsory vaccinations.</p>\n<p>Manski is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and an econometrician in the field of rational choice theory, which involves using applied economics to make decisions. The talk focused on how to make public policy decisions using incomplete data and information, specifically whether vaccinations in the U.S. should be decentralized or compulsory.</p>\n<p>According to Manski, welfare economics involves a “social planner” who makes beneficial decisions on behalf of the community and often has to make judgements with limited information, making it difficult for the planner to determine optimal choices for issues such as mandated vaccines.</p>\n<p>“So the kind of knowledge that’s assumed in the literature around social planning, that the planner actually knows everything you need to know in order to solve optimization problems — in the real world we don’t have that kind of knowledge,” Manski said. “We may know some of these things, but we don’t know all of it. It’s definitely going to be true with the vaccination problem.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s a really hard thing to make policy decisions that are controversial like vaccine decisions when our knowledge about the effects of vaccines is incomplete. – Economics professor Peter Kuhn</p></blockquote>\n<p>Manski said elementary decision theory provides specific procedures for decision making using partial information and is a two part process that involves first eliminating the comparatively worse or “dominated” decision option and then determining a method of choosing a generally optimal or “undominated” option. Manski said he believes there are multiple ways of deciding which method is “dominated,” contrary to arguments that there exists one particular way to maximize optimality.</p>\n<p>“The whole point of decision theory is to try to have a kind of explicit procedures for making decisions with limited information,” Manski said. “The harder part — where there’s no agreement to this day — is how we are going to choose a dominated policy.”</p>\n<p>According to Manski, in a decentralized healthcare system such as that of the U.S. people do not consider the social and external consequences of their private medical decisions. This issue leads to government intervention in deciding voluntary or mandatory treatments, particularly vaccinations for contagious diseases.</p>\n<p>Manski said there is a lack of knowledge about the benefits of vaccinations despite the common belief that the more people who are vaccinated, the less chance of a disease.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_62945\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-62945\" data-attachment-id=\"62945\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/guest-professor-lectured-on-vaccination-and-public-policy/manski_vivian-bui-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,397\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.3\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1430318602\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"66\",\"iso\":\"6400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Manski_Vivian Bui-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?fit=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-62945\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=250%2C165&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manski_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=500%2C330&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-62945\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Manski said the process of determining the social cost function of mandated vaccines uses a simple model that consists of two variables — the costs of getting sick and the costs of being vaccinated. Vaccination will likely lower the frequency of illness, but may also increase medical costs, lead to side effects and infringe on personal medical choices.</p>\n<p>“Mandatory vaccinations improve public health relative to decentralization [and] lowers the illness rate,” Manski said. “On the other hand, mandating vaccination means more people are going to get vaccinated, and that’s going to increase the cost of production of the vaccine, the vaccines may have some side effects, and then they have the real political issue of so called reducing personal freedom.”</p>\n<p>According to Manski, he used the simple model he constructed and applied econometrics to lay out multiple methods of making an optimal choice when determining whether to mandate vaccines with partial information.</p>\n<p>“I sought to assist decision making by juxtaposing several well-known criteria and comparing the policies they generate,” Manski said. “Whether a public health agency should use one of these or some other criterion to cope with uncertainty is ultimately a matter to be decided by the agency.”</p>\n<p>Economics professor Peter Kuhn said Manski effectively presented several options for making judgements on controversial issues like vaccination.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really hard thing to make policy decisions that are controversial like vaccine decisions when our knowledge about the effects of vaccines is incomplete,” Kuhn said. “Professor Manski gives us a good way of making decisions in that world and a way that is dispassionate and scientific and also respects the beliefs and values of everyone in society.”</p>\n<p>Economics professor Shelly Lundberg said Manksi’s talk shed light on how “tremendously important” it is to understand the constraints of public decision-making.</p>\n<p>“I think the paper is not so much vaccination,” Lundberg said. “It’s about dealing with the uncertainty when you’re making public policy decisions and how very difficult that is. I think we have to recognize more explicitly the limits of what we know.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Thursday, April 30, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62960\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/guest-professor-lectured-on-vaccination-and-public-policy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62960\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/guest-professor-lectured-on-vaccination-and-public-policy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/guest-professor-lectured-on-vaccination-and-public-policy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/guest-professor-lectured-on-vaccination-and-public-policy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-30/guest-professor-lectured-on-vaccination-and-public-policy/","id":2776,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2775,2774,2773],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Financial Aid Office Backs Off of Controversial Plan","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rightsaid-PK.jpg?resize=201%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rightsaid-PK.jpg?resize=201%2C303&ssl=1","description":"The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI).","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships is no longer examining the possibility of reducing financial aid award letters to students who waive Gaucho Health Insurance (GHI).</p>\n<p>An announcement reflecting the change of course to pursue a plan came Wednesday night from On-Campus senator Matthew Santos, stated after weeks of negotiations between Associated Students and the financial aid office. The idea originally involved reducing the portion of financial aid award letters slated for covering the cost of health insurance to students who waive GHI. Discussions between the financial aid office and A.S. yielded no change in the status quo.</p>\n<p>Director of the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Mike Miller said in an email to A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau that the idea was to allocate funds more efficiently from students who are not using the fully designated amount for health insurance and redistributing that amount for other purposes.</p>\n<p>“The issue at hand is that approximately 50% of undergraduate students waive out of GHI and their financial aid awards are not adjusted even though the students are not incurring the GHI expense,” Miller said in an email. “Currently, financial aid recipients are able to use those funds to address other expenses. Given the rapid increase in GHI costs over the last few years, this has evolved into a significant issue. Based on our projections of past student history, we estimate a savings of about $6M in UCSB Grant if we make the revisions for GHI waivers.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major and GHI advisory committee member Alex Hill said while he understood the financial aid office’s position, he believes the idea was unpopular and stood to affect a large number of students.</p>\n<p>“I understand the business perspective of the financial office and it is necessary to be prudent with any budget to make sure that they aren’t bleeding money. From their perspective, if you’re looking at their budget, they were more or less spending their budget inefficiently and they were trying to be more efficient,” Hill said. “However, their decisions do affect students directly in a way that was grossly unpopular with the student body.”</p>\n<p>A.S. President and fourth-year psychology and sociology double major Ali Guthy said the financial aid office required additional concrete evidence before moving forward with a formal plan on the idea.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, they lacked specific data about what are student health insurance plans and needs at the time,” Guthy said. “They were making the decision, from my perspective, on a series of interactions with students coming into the financial office, which is good, firsthand experience is really great. But based off of that they needed to conduct a formal survey and focus groups and studies with students.”</p>\n<p>Miller said in a statement that nothing would change regarding financial aid award allocations for health insurance and that the decision was reached after investigation into the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“After spending time researching the issue and looking into the ever evolving Affordable Care Act and other health insurance options UCSB students have, I determined more time was needed before we could formulate a plan that I felt comfortable with,” Miller said. “Moving forward, there will be many more conversations at the system-wide and campus levels about this issue, but for 2015-16, I have made the decision to continue our current practices.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, a concrete plan to implement reduced award letters for students who waived GHI never existed, and Miller said it was only ever an idea.</p>\n<p>“There was never an agreement to move forward with a plan to adjust financial aid awards for GHI waivers. There were simply conversations with a couple of key departments and AS members,” Miller said in an email. “From day one, we all said we wanted to be thoughtful about the issue before moving forward with a plan.”</p>\n<p>Guthy also said she was pleased to hear the financial aid office would no longer consider any plans to reduce award letters and that her office would continue to discuss the financial aid situation with Miller’s office.</p>\n<p>“We have to acknowledge they’re coming from a good place. They really listen to students on this issue and I personally could not be more happy with the outcome,” Guthy said. “Students just need to be aware that this conversation is happening. This conversation will continue to happen in the next couple months.”</p>\n<p>Internal Vice President and fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau said she believes student opposition to the idea contributed to the financial aid office’s decision to discontinue consideration on the proposed possible plan.</p>\n<p>“With more talk about it amongst the student population it became very present or obvious that students were not ready nor were they gung-ho about this whole thing,” Lau said, “and that’s why they’re slowing down the process now.”</p>\n<p>According to Jodie Nakajima, a fourth-year economics and accounting major, despite the change of direction taken by the financial aid office, she will still be waiving GHI.</p>\n<p>“I think it depends on how much they would reduce it by, but insurance is pretty expensive anyways … so I probably would still waive it regardless,” Nakajima said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/financial-aid-office-backs-off-of-controversial-plan/","id":2834,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2833,2832,2831],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

President with OPP Jimmy Villareal said one major project he was involved with last year was a general poll that allowed students to give input to A.S.</p>\n<p>“An effort that I was kind of a part of was the Associated Students strategic plan, and that was basically something I did last year,” Villareal said. “We took surveys from over 1,800 students, kind of asked them what they wanted to see from us, what does A.S. do well, what does A.S. not do well, how can we improve and what do they want to see from us in the future.”</p>\n<p>According to Villareal, his main goal is to anticipate and cater to the wants and needs of the student body.</p>\n<p>“That’s really what I want to focus on, is what kind of services we’re providing for the students, how can we take the services that we had already and make them better,” Villareal said. “How can we be more efficient with those, and how can we identify things that students really want, that we aren’t providing already, and find a way to do that and make it feasible.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running for A.S. President with FTP Jason Garshfield said he is running in order to provide students with an option to choose a candidate that is “a little closer to the average students and their wants and needs.”</p>\n<p>“I want the students to have a choice this year. I think it’s disappointing that there’s only one political party and I thought that to remedy that situation I would run,” Garshfield said. “I haven’t been building up my resume for three years and I think that makes me a unique candidate, as opposed to people who have been devoting themselves to A.S. and don’t really have any other interests.”</p>\n<p>According to Garshfield, he would place greater importance on protecting students’ rights as opposed to forcing his agenda on them.</p>\n<p>“I think the changes that I implement would be a subtraction rather than addition because I think that ultimately my job as A.S. president is not to force my agenda on the students. My agenda is to protect the fundamental rights of the students and to treat everyone as an individual,” Garshfield said. “If that involves subtracting some things from the office and subtracting the power of the president, then I will definitely do whatever’s in my power to do so.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology major running for IVP with OPP Kimia Hashemian said she wants to bring back a system called Gaucho Rewards in order to increase student participation at university and Isla Vista events.</p>\n<p>“It’s a program to increase attendance to the different events we have on campus,” Hashemian said. “Go to a sports game and get 50 points, if you go to town hall you get 100 points, and these points can be redeemed for cost-free things, such as going up Storke tower, or having lunch with the A.S. president, something like that.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major running for EVPLA with OPP Paola De La Cruz said her main focus would be to address issues concerning housing, sexual assault and community building on campus and in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am running because I want to improve the quality of life of students in Isla Vista, and really voice concerns and experiences that I went through,” De La Cruz said. “I really want to work towards creating some temporary housing on campus; then for sexual assault I want to develop and execute a campaign to battle sexual assault in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running for EVPLA with FTP Brandon Morse said medical marijuana dispensaries in I.V. could be beneficial in generating revenue for self-governance and other community-based purposes.</p>\n<p>“I think the one thing we’re missing out on is revenue streams as far as the cannabis industry,” Morse said. “I think that there are a substantial number of medical cannabis patients in the Isla Vista area, and the fact that we don’t have immediate safe access for patients is a travesty, and it is also something that we’re lacking as far as a potential revenue source to be able to support things like self-governance.”</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major running independently for EVPSA Mohsin Mirza said he hopes to address the issue that “the cost of school is going up while the quality is going down.”</p>\n<p>“I am running because we’re at a crossroads right now in higher education. The cost of school is going up but our quality is going down,” Mirza said. “As part of my platform I’ve got several things. The first is mobilize students against the tuition hike through educational actions leading to actions to put pressure on the governor to fund the UC’s more.”</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology major running as EVPSA with OPP Carlos Lopez said he wants to better inform students about student debt and budgeting to better involve students in discussions involving tuition increases.</p>\n<p>“One of the things I did in my second year was I put on a weeklong event called the week of revenue. It talked about student debt, how student debt has risen in the last years, and a couple of things that we can try to fight the rising and tuition,” Lopez said. “So I’m hoping to have something every single quarter to try to engage students more.”</p>\n<p>Third-year political science major running independently for SAG Jorge Escobar said few people know about the SAG office, and publicizing their service would be one of his priorities.</p>\n<p>“The office of the Student Advocate General is relatively new, people don’t know us, but we’re a great resource on campus,” Escobar said. “One thing we want to work on is solidifying the office, making sure that we progress. We’re still learning, we want to be able to utilize our resources better.”</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies major running independently for SAG Anais Zavala said the office gives advice and helps students with “anything that has to do with campus policies.”</p>\n<p>“If you get written up in the dorms, plagiarize, break a student code of conduct, we know what to refer you to or we can just give you advice on what to do,” Zavala said. “That’s something that I’m really familiar with, and I’d just like to let people know more about our office.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-06/a-s-hears-from-candidates/","id":2853,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2852,2851,2850],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Families Sue For Wrongful Death","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1456763_10152153038379879_1125226773_n.jpg?resize=253%2C339&ssl=1","description":"The families of former UCSB students David Wang, James Hong and George Chen jointly filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Santa Barbara County, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department and Cap...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p> </p>\n<p>The families of former UCSB students, engineering majors Weihan “David” Wang and Cheng “James” Hong and computer science major George Chen, jointly filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Monday against Santa Barbara County, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department (SBCSD) and Capri Apartments over the deaths of their sons during last year’s May 23 Isla Vista mass murder.</p>\n<p>Wang and Hong were roommates of 22-year-old Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) student Elliot Rodger, who murdered the pair as well as their visiting friend, Chen, at their residence at #7 Capri Apartments on Seville Road on May 23 before fatally shooting three other UCSB students and injuring 14 others.</p>\n<p>Representing the families are Los Angeles-based wrongful death law firms Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas, seeking to prove the legal liability of Capri Apartments and SBCSD in the deaths of Wang, Hong and Chen. The civil suit contends the defendants neglected signs of Rodger’s threat potential, which could have prevented the tragedy had they been better addressed.</p>\n<p>The families are pursuing compensation from the county for emotional, physical and psychological damages incurred by the loss of their sons in the massacre, as well as attorney’s fees for the costs of lawsuit.</p>\n<p>A joint statement written by Becker Law Group and McNicholas &amp; McNicholas stated the plaintiffs are citing SBCSD for negligence before and during an April 30 welfare check on Rodger, and Capri Apartments for carelessness when investigating and assigning roommates.</p>\n<p>“The lawsuit alleges that the SBCSD increased the danger to the decedents who were in a place of safety when a welfare check was performed on April 30, 2014,” the press release stated. “The lawsuit also alleges that Capri Apartments failed to perform a proper background check; conduct a reasonable investigation of Rodger before assigning him roommates; properly monitor its roommate pairings; and warn Rodger’s roommates of his unstable and violent propensities.”</p>\n<p>Chen’s mother Kelly Wang, who attended Tuesday’s lawsuit press conference in Los Angeles on behalf of the three victims’ families, said it has been difficult for the victims’ parents to accept that crimes committed by Rodger may have been prevented had the Sheriff’s Department conducted a more thorough search during the welfare check.</p>\n<p>“We were deeply saddened when we learned that in several earlier incidents, the police officers had a chance to investigate the killer, and would have stopped the rampage,” Wang said. “We were truly devastated when we learned that the killer made a narrow escape from the welfare check just less than a month before the massacre.”</p>\n<p>Becker Law Group Owner Todd Becker said Capri Apartments should have been responsible for conducting more thorough research on Rodger in order to realize that he was “not a suitable roommate for anyone,” as proved by numerous conflicts he had with all of his past roommates which required him to constantly move and switch roommates.</p>\n<p>“As student housing, Capri had a duty to investigate Mr. Rodger and determine if he was suitable to be a roommate, of not only our boys but all the other young men that he was roommates with before,” Becker said. “He had seven prior roommates before our kids were his roommates, and he had conflicts with each and every one of them.”</p>\n<p>According to Becker, Capri apartments only investigated the financial capabilities of Rodger to pay rent instead of conducting a thorough background check that would have revealed his inclinations toward anger and violence.</p>\n<p>“With one simple click on the internet … they could have easily found out that this information was available, [that] Rodger was not a suitable roommate,” Becker said. “They only investigated that was Rodger able to pay. Well, his father’s in Hollywood, clearly he’s able to pay. But they didn’t investigate the security issues and his racist and misogynistic tendencies, clearly seen online and in his rantings and ravings and interactions with police, and interactions with all his roommates.”</p>\n<p>Becker said Rodger had several conflicts with past roommates, the first of which occurred August 2011 and continued with a new roommates up to the massacre. According to Becker, Capri apartments made no effort to notify Rodger’s roommates of his past switches despite knowing of Rodger’s prior roommate issues.</p>\n<p>“Despite the defendant’s knowledge of Rodger’s bizarre and violent behavior, they … withheld their knowledge of Rodger’s sadistic behavior,” Becker said.</p>\n<p>According to Becker, it was difficult for Wang, Hong and Chen to protect themselves in the assigned living situation, and generally there should be a “higher standard of investigation to protect these individuals.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not a typical situation where you have somebody across the hall from you in another apartment where you can lock the door, and you can be away from them,” Becker said. “You’re locked inside with this person. That standard wasn’t done and because of that, these three innocent boys and other innocent victims in Santa Barbara were killed.”</p>\n<p>Partner of McNicholas &amp; McNicholas Patrick McNicholas said the lawsuit claims that actions taken by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s department prior to and during the welfare check also put Wang, Hong and Chen in danger.</p>\n<p>“The second claim is a federal constitutional claim and the theory against the sheriff’s department in this case actually increased the danger to the roommates and their guest, because they were in a position of safety, they were outside of the apartment, they were at school while the welfare check was going on,” McNicholas said.</p>\n<p>According to McNicholas, the easily accessible “knowable information” that the officers failed to check include videos online, evidence of weaponry purchases and a concerned phone call to the Sheriff’s Office from Rodger’s mother. McNicholas said these items should have prompted the officers to do more than question Rodger at the welfare check.</p>\n<p>“With the social media that had been uploaded, with the fact that Elliot Rodger had purchased weapons and ammunition, with the fact that you had a mom who called because she was so concerned about the mental, emotional and psychological state of her son,” McNicholas said. “A welfare check was initiated, and a cache of weapons and ammunition was probably 15 to 20 feet away from the sheriffs who came to the door and they never got through the door.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover declined to comment but issued a statement on the matter.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office cannot comment on a matter of pending litigation, and anything we might say in response would be insufficient when measured against the grief suffered by the families of those killed so tragically on May 23, 2014,” Hoover said in a statement. “Nevertheless, we continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers, and to extend our deepest sympathies to them.”</p>\n<p>According to Wang, there should be new law enforcement requirements and standards set in place to ensure welfare checks include investigations into weapon possession as well as online and social media searches.</p>\n<p>“We believe the procedures in the current police system are outdated and should be repaired to protect innocent lives in today’s world,” Wang said. “For example, a welfare check system must be complete and thorough. It should have a weapons check and internet profile search as a mandatory step.”</p>\n<p>Wang said that, as a mother, she hopes the Sheriff’s Department takes more care to prevent future incidents like that May 23 massacre to happen again, though she was unable to protect her own son.</p>\n<p>“I speak to you with a mother’s heart,” Wang said. “I’m fully supported by the other two mothers of the victims. We love our children with all our hearts. We will love other children with all our mind. We wish we could rely on ourselves to save our sons. We weren’t given the chance, but now we do everything we can to save other children before it’s too late. And that is our way of remembering our sons.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61581\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61581\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-03-04/families-sue-for-wrongful-death/","id":4749,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4748,4747,4746],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Hosted by A.S. President Ali Guthy and A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau, the forum informed students about and addressed questions regarding the proposed plan.</p>\n<p>According to Lau, students who currently receive financial aid are allocated around $2,600 to cover health insurance costs no matter whether or not they waive GHI, which is the reason behind the financial office’s plan to reduce aid.</p>\n<p>“Currently, students who have a certain need level all get financial aid for GHI at $2,600. Even though your expenses are less, even if you waive out, you still get that much if you’re the same need level as someone who still participates in Gaucho Health Insurance,” Lau said. “That was the concern that the financial aid office had and that’s why they proposed this new financial aid package.”</p>\n<p>Lau said the financial aid office is apprehensive that students will purposely select inadequate health insurances costing significantly less than $2,600 instead of GHI to have excess financial aid money for other non-health purposes.</p>\n<p>“Their main concern was that people were getting so much money, this $2,600 for health insurance, but on average outside of UCSB the amount that you have to pay for health insurance is a lot less than that,” Lau said. “Let’s say its $1,500, so now students have an extra $1,000 so to them, it seemed like the $1,000 was enough to entice someone to essentially get a crap health insurance and they didn’t like that.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, students may still require the excess money to pay for necessities such as rent or food. The financial aid office contends the excess money should be used to provide aid to new students, or to students who previously applied unsuccessfully for aid due to the lack of funds.</p>\n<p>“From our perspective, we were saying that while students are using that extra $1,000 for housing, or for textbooks, or for food, they still need that money,” Guthy said. “But the financial aid office’s argument is that well if we take that $1,000 back, so instead of giving you the $2,600 when your health insurance only costs $1,500 we take $1,000 away, we can spend that money to allocate more financial aid to more students.”</p>\n<p>Second-year history of public policy major Cassie Mancini said aid money is still necessary to cover additional healthcare costs for those without GHI.</p>\n<p>“I would say that even if you are on your parents’ plan that doesn’t mean you don’t have healthcare costs,” Mancini said. “What if you’re on your parents plan and you have to go to the hospital for some reason or you’re on an expensive drug? You’re still paying for healthcare you’re still paying for the price of those drugs or the price of that pay in some way or another.”<br>\nAccording to Guthy, health insurance is required for all students, and the financial aid office’s original proposal would not provide any financial aid money for health insurance unless it is GHI.</p>\n<p>“It’s essentially saying, ‘You can either have this health insurance or we’re not going to pay for anything else,’” Guthy said.</p>\n<p>Lau said the initial plan would create a health insurance monopoly where students receiving financial aid are essentially forced to choose GHI.</p>\n<p>“It almost seemed like they were monopolizing the health insurance market for all students saying, ‘You have to have GHI to get financial aid for it,’” Lau said.</p>\n<p>A.S. met with the financial aid office for a revised plan, which will involve surveying students to determine a health insurance industry average that students will be given if they choose to waive GHI, instead of the original proposal which would not allocate any money for health costs, according to Guthy.</p>\n<p>“We came up with a preliminary agreement that the financial aid office would pay an industry standard to students who waive out of Gaucho Health Insurance,” Guthy said. “They’re planning to conduct a survey to all students who opt out of Gaucho Health Insurance to see kind of what kinds they have to define what this industry standard is.”</p>\n<p>Guthy said students who choose an insurance plan above the surveyed industry standard can still receive financial aid to cover the difference.</p>\n<p>“If your health insurance happens to be greater than the industry average but below Gaucho Health Insurance you can still go into the financial aid office and get a grant to cover your health insurance,” Guthy said, “All you need to do is come in with a bill and they’ll pay for it.”</p>\n<p>According to Guthy, the financial aid office established the proposal to allocate money more efficiently so that students receive the precise monetary amount they require and no more.</p>\n<p>“The kind of motivation behind this is to make the spending of financial aid more efficient,” Guthy said. “They want you to spend the money to the exact level that you need, they don’t want you to have excess. And they’re arguing if we give you more money for health insurance than you need, that’s excess and we don’t want you to have excess.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year psychology major Alex Hill said the financial aid office allocates a certain amount of financial aid specifically for health purposes, and any excess portion of that amount not being used for health is deemed wasteful by the financial aid office.</p>\n<p>“You have a lot of students who are either shopping on the market and getting a cheaper plan, or are on their parents plan and ultimately their costs are reduced. Students are having say between $500 and $1,000 per year extra money that is not going to health costs,” Hill said. “According to the financial aid office, based off their breakdown, technically we’re wasting money, so we need to adjust our standards so it’s more strict.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-61182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-61182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/a-s-forum-examines-proposed-changes-to-financial-aid/","id":2878,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2877,2876,2875],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"I.V.

Clinic building to discuss public issues in I.V. with long-term residents, students and staff.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s forum featured a continuation of a discussion from <a title=\"Stakeholders Meeting Discusses I.V. Demographic Difficulties, Parking\" href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2015-01-28/meeting-discusses-i-v-demographics-parking/\" target=\"_blank\">last week’s meeting</a> concerning parking problems and deliberation on ways to popularize arts and culture in I.V. The stakeholders meeting is one of several held weekly for the past few months concerning pending legislation in the California state assembly to turn I.V. into a community services district (CSD). A larger-scale town hall meeting will also be held at 7 p.m. on Feb. 5 at Santa Barbara Hillel to discuss potential services that would be offered by the proposed I.V. CSD.</p>\n<p>Long-term I.V. homeowner Steve Fisher said there are 3,100 legal parking spaces in I.V., a significantly small amount compared to the number of I.V. residents.</p>\n<p>“There are 3,100 parking spaces [and] 21,000 residents,” Fisher said, “That’s one parking space per seven residents.”</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Executive Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) and fourth-year psychology major Cameron Schunk, investigations concerning parking in I.V. may be conducted through collaboration with the university geography department.</p>\n<p>“Right now, I was thinking about getting in contact with the geography department, and seeing whether that was something they would even want to change,” Schunk said. “Because for all I know, they’ll say maybe, ‘We don’t care enough,’ or ‘we have other things focus on.’ It’s contingent upon whether the geography department is willing.”</p>\n<p>Art professor and long-term I.V. resident Kim Yasuda said increasing available parking space would decrease available public gathering space for arts and culture events in I.V.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, what’s replaced [public space] is parking,” Yasuda said. “Parking has actually taken up all of our formal public spaces that you would have in Europe, and Mexico, such as public plazas.”</p>\n<p>Yasuda also said I.V. First Fridays at People’s Park is an example of how the availability of more space can provide a safe environment for showcasing art and gathering community members in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I.V. First Fridays is the gathering of some 400 people late night that’s safe and public and engaging,” Yasuda said. “So I’m making the case for public space access both during the day and after hours to be part of this whole arts and culture concept of Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>James Joyce, deputy district director for State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, said among other services provided in I.V. such as water, lighting and policing, discussion concerning arts and culture related services is seldom prioritized in self-governance.</p>\n<p>“When you’re looking at the arts and culture I can understand that there may be a resistance when you see it among the other options and services,” Joyce said.</p>\n<p>According to Joyce, arts and culture is an important community aspect that should not be neglected in the self-governance discussion.</p>\n<p>”When in history have artists not come in to save the day?” Joyce said. “Whenever there is a rebirth or a renaissance or something along those lines, the artists are always the first ones in. The starving artists. Why? Because they’re cheap, and because it helps rebuild things … that’s kind of my mindset.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-60486\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-60486\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-04/i-v-stakeholders-meeting-continues-parking-discussion/","id":4785,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[4784,4783,4782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Senate and meets weekly on Mondays to allocate funding to various student groups and other university affiliated projects. At the meeting, the board addressed finance requests and funded GIVE to Isla Vista, the Muslim Student Association, Model United Nations (MUN) and Unión Salvadoreña de Estudiantes Universitarios (USEU) among others. </p>\n<p>South Asian student group UCSB Indus requested $2,280 to fund a cultural dance and a cappella concert in mid-February as part of campus-wide cultural awareness week and was granted $1,880 of the request. </p>\n<p>The International Student Association also requested $1,564 to fund their “Welcome Back” concert in the Hub this Friday evening and was granted the full amount.</p>\n<p>GIVE to Isla Vista is an event held at the end of each academic year where donated student items from students moving out of I.V. in June are sold to the general public in a fundraising event for which the organization gives volunteers to staff the event. The event last year drew over 50 tons of merchandise and provided money to over a dozen student organizations. Of the requested $11,085, the board agreed to fund the group $8,766 to cover costs for a site coordinator, a volunteer coordinator, site clothing and a truck driver.</p>\n<p>The Muslim Student Association requested $1,062 for tickets and transportation to attend the 2015 MSA West Conference in mid-January, where MSA chapters from California, Arizona and Nevada will meet for three days to discuss relevant issues related to Muslim identity and collective history. The board passed a motion to fully fund the requested amount and to withdraw $230 in money previously allocated to the group last November.</p>\n<p>MUN requested a total of $25,294 for their upcoming events in spring quarter. The board decided to move $517 from the Office of Student Life spring account into an account for Academic teams, and to allocate $5,000 towards hotel fees for MUN. </p>\n<p>Unión Salvadoreña de Estudiantes Universitarios (USEU), an organization representing the Salvadoran student community, is holding a two-day annual summit that will include workshops and team building activities for groups from chapters at other campuses. The group requested a total of $1,022 of which $946 was allocated to be spent on muffins, orange juice, coffee, water and other assorted foods and utensils. </p>\n<p>According to fourth-year economics and accounting major Angela Lau, 50 percent of the foods purchased can be from Costco, but the other 50 percent need to be purchased from local or organic sources. </p>\n<p>“That’s what you all are supposed to tell them during the finance and business workshops,” Lau said. “You say, ‘You still have to use organic foods,’ and they’ll say, ‘Oh, we’re getting our food from Costco, what about them?’ You still have to have 50 percent of it be USDA organic, local.” </p>\n<p>Lau said that although the Isla Vista Food Co-op is an option for students to buy organic food, it is not necessary to purchase food there. </p>\n<p>“It doesn’t have to be from the Co-op,” Lau said. “The Co-op is automatically local and organic, but you can get it from Costco and have it be organic.” </p>\n<p>The Board also passed a motion to fully fund USEU as a one-time exception for the food costs and plan to emphasize spending restrictions in future finance and business workshops. </p>\n<p>Other fully funded groups include the professional business fraternity Delta Sigma Pi; the Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology department for their 11th-annual Graduate Student Symposium; the Indus organization for their cultural show; and the International Student Association for their welcome back concert this Friday. Recreational computer hacking group SB Hacks also requested $2,000 to help fund an upcoming “hackathon” that promises to draw some 500-600 participants, the motion to fund was tabled indefinitely.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-59434\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-59434\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-07/a-s-finance-and-business-committee-delegates-funds-to-student-groups/","id":2590,"author":{"id":161,"name":"Cheryl Sun"},"related":[2589,2588,2587],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Geographer Receives Plous Award","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Assistant professor of geography Krzysztof Janowicz was recently awarded the 2014-2015 Harold J.

Plous Award by the College of Letters and Sciences for his outstanding performance as a junior faculty member.</p>\n<p>The Plous Award is one of the university’s oldest and most prestigious honors, established in 1957 in honor of assistant professor of economics Harold J. Plous who died at 32 years old after only three years in the position. The award is given to new and junior faculty members early in their careers with the university.</p>\n<p>Janowicz, who received recognition for his research in the geographic information science and “geoinformatics” fields, is scheduled to give the annual Harold J. Plous lecture next Spring as part of his appointment.</p>\n<p>Dean of Science and professor of physics Pierre Wiltzius said he believes Janowicz has been an impressive junior scholar from the start of his career at the university several years ago.</p>\n<p>“He has been with us now maybe for something like two years, and I was actually part of helping recruit him with the geography department,” Wiltzius said.</p>\n<p>“Among a very strong competitive pool of candidates he was the strongest already, so we were very lucky to be able to attract him in a very important area of geography.”</p>\n<p>According to geography professor Dar Roberts, Janowicz’s work in mobile computing and GPS based location services is especially relevant today.</p>\n<p>“The growing way we use smart phones, tablets or other devices to navigate our cars, find good restaurants, stores that sell specialized items, or simply look for things in geographic space,” Roberts said. “You can easily imagine that research that makes this easier and more accurate is of high interest.”</p>\n<p>Professor and chair of geography Dan Montello said the Plous Award demonstrates more than creative work and research.</p>\n<p>“I would emphasize that this is not only about being a talented junior professor, but it’s about already getting involved in campus life,” Montello said. “And that means intellectual activity both within your department and outside your department, I think those are important criteria.”</p>\n<p>According to Montello, starting this year Janowicz will chair the Cognitive Science Program, a position usually filled by a tenured professor instead of a junior professor, which is not a tenured position. The program gives graduate students the option of adding a Ph.D. emphasis in cognitive science.</p>\n<p>Wiltzius said the department is honored to have such a distinguished colleague as Janowicz.</p>\n<p>“We’re very proud that one of the members of the science division won this very prestigious prize. I couldn’t be happier for Janowicz and also for the Department of Geography, which is a highly ranked department,” Wiltzius said. “It’s one of the highest ranking geography departments of the country.”</p>\n<p>According to Wiltzius, Janowicz’s studies center around Geographic Information Science.</p>\n<p>“[GIS] is how we deal with all the information that relates one way or another to geography,” Wiltzius said. “The big data bases, all the information that comes from sensors whether they are terrestrial, satellite or airplane based.

There are many ways to make Cachuma more reliable that will be looked at as well.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said the water level of Lake Cachuma has reached its lowest point since the drought in the late 1980s.</p>\n<p>“I have watched with great concern as the lake level has been dropping over the last couple of years, and even though we’ve had rain, we haven’t had enough rain, clearly, to make up for the usage of the lake,” Farr said. “It used to take a lot longer for the lake to drop, even when we didn’t have a lot of rainfall. And now it’s really only been three and a half years or so since the lake was full and spilling.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Less than 10 percent of our regular water is from groundwater. There just isn’t a lot of capacity in our local area. We can only use a small fraction of this during the drought.” — Arturo Keller</p></blockquote>\n<p>Farr said rainfall is the only way to alleviate the drought situation.</p>\n<p>“They can only fill if there’s rain,” Farr said. “If it doesn’t rain, it doesn’t really matter how big your reservoir is, because there’s just no water to put into it.”</p>\n<p>Bren School Professor of Biogeochemistry Arturo Keller said a short-term supplemental water supply would involve bringing in water from the California State Projects, and a long-term solution may be to consider a desalination plant such as the Charles E. Meyer Desalination Plant downtown, which the City of Council of Santa Barbara recently reopened.</p>\n<p>“If we have another low rain year, we need to start on the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2014-10-16/sb-plans-to-restart-desalination-facility/\">desalination plant</a>, and also lease some water rights to have a reasonable level at Cachuma,” Keller said.</p>\n<p>According to Director Fayram, some cities such as Goleta and Carpinteria are turning to groundwater usage to make up for the shortages. In addition, Keller said groundwater supplies in Santa Barbara are insufficient to compensate for the drought conditions.</p>\n<p>“Less than 10 percent of our regular water is from groundwater,” Keller said. “There just isn’t a lot of capacity in our local area. We can only use a small fraction of this during the drought.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is currently in Stage Two drought conditions, indicating that a serious water shortage is expected, and drought-based water rates and mandatory water use restrictions may be implemented.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53762\" style=\"width: 373px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"530774379\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57151\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-53762\" data-attachment-id=\"53762\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/governor-declares-california-drought-emergency/drought-photo-by-peter-mounteer/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer.jpg?fit=2189%2C1262&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2189,1262\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D80\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1390919753\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0008\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Drought photo by Peter Mounteer\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer.jpg?fit=888%2C512&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-53762\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Drought-photo-by-Peter-Mounteer-1024x590.jpg?resize=363%2C209\" alt=\"Pictured above is a dried-out marsh beside the Santa Ynez apartments.
