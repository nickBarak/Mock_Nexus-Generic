In just a little over a week, from April 7-9, Santa Barbara’s own Live Oak Campground will be transformed into a cornucopia of sight and sound as the Lucidity Festival congregates there for its sixth meeting. The finale to Lucidity’s six-year story arc beginning in 2012, this year’s celebration will be ripe with music, workshops, yoga, art and tasty, locally sourced food.</p>\n<p>For its sixth year, the community has adopted Eudaimonia as its theme, a concept with origins in ancient Greek philosophy. Alison Hensley, Lucidity’s food and sustainability head, describes Eudaimonia as a complex concept with many various interpretations: “It’s the good composed of all goods. An ability which suffices for living well. Perfection in respect of virtue. Resources sufficient for a living creature.” If these words do not fully capture the spirit of Eudaimonia, perhaps that is because no words can.  If you desire to learn more, maybe a more direct encounter with the ideal at some kind of transformational festival could provide you with the holistic knowledge you seek.</p>\n<p>While many will attend Lucidity this year for its renowned workshops on permaculture, sustainability, spirituality and community-building, the music takes precedence over all for a significant portion of festival-goers. These are the people who drool over newly announced lineups like freshly cooked plates of teriyaki tempeh, and Lucidity’s lineups will not leave them disappointed this year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The Lucid stage, situated in the festival’s heart, will feature prominent psychedelic dub and drum-n-bas British producers Ott and dBridge, as well as a bounty of other electronic acts.  The Nest, inside of the Lover’s Nest village, seems to be the hub of more intimate, lyrically driven performances by the likes of Canadian world music group Delhi 2 Dublin as well as the faerie-like Ayla Nereo.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Nook stage at the Nomad’s Nook village is set up to be more of a funky, harder-dancing arena toeing the all-too-thin line between group trance and discotheque.  Throughout the weekend the tables will spin hypnotically under the command of Christian Martin, Low Steppa and a panoply of other techno and deep house wizards. One to watch out for among the group is NYC DJ Manik, hailing from Queens; he is able to blend classic and acid house with subtle funk and disco beats in a way few are able to do. The Nook stage will also feature a tribute to beloved Lucidity DJ Nicholas “Pumpkin” Alvarado, who unfortunately passed away in 2016.</p>\n<p>The amount of articles about self-care going around social media right now is astounding, so I know there is a chance readers will just tune out these next couple of sentences, but <i>festivals are a space in which self-care is vital!</i> For those of you trekking out to the Lucidity festival next weekend, make sure you pack yourself meals, drink plenty of water and remember to get at least a little sleep!

","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Get ready, Santa Barbara, because in a little over six weeks from now, April 7-9, the Lucidity Festival will return to our very own Live Oak Campground for its sixth and final gathering. This year, an estimated 5,000 enthusiastic participants will gather in the Santa Ynez Hills for the festival’s ultimate “Eudaimonia” incarnation.</p>\n<p>Eudaimonia is a Greek word meaning “happiness rooted in virtue,” as described by festival co-founder Jonah Haas. In order to elaborate on the meaning of his words, Haas delved into the history of the Lucidity festival and its unique structure. Lucidity is part of a particular subset of large-scale festivals known as transformational festivals. Coined by Jeet-Kei Leung at a TEDTalk in 2011, the term refers “to events that [are] participatory, interactive, immersive and collaborative, integrating educational workshops, healing arts, music and dance and an inclusive approach to culture and spirituality.”</p>\n<p>Further distinguishing Lucidity from the already narrow group of transformational festivals such as Burning Man or Lightning in a Bottle is its unique six-year story arc. Throughout Lucidity’s previous five lives, the gathering has woven a tale of what Haas calls, “personal and collective transformation, inspired by Joseph Campbell’s concept of the Hero’s Journey.” Haas and the rest of the festival’s family of co-owners released their collective brainchild upon the world back in 2012, and it has seen healthy annual growth in each succeeding year.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>In addition to the three day weekend already packed with a killer music lineup featuring the likes of Ott, Delhi 2 Dublin, Dirtwire and Dirtybird Records’ Christian Martin, this year will feature a full week of six educational courses. The diverse set of topics includes Ayurvedic herbalism, designing and building with bamboo, creating your own personal mythology and dream council.</p>\n<p>The courses are part of a movement within the Lucidity Festival called Lucid University. The University started at Lucidity two years ago, growing from one course on permaculture to last year’s five-course catalogue to the veritable cornucopia of knowledge we have before us today. When asked which course he was most excited for, Haas responded: “I’m most excited about the building and designing with bamboo class. It will be led by world [renowned] bamboo artist and architect Gerard Minikawa of Bamboo DNA.” Lucid University will soon become a year-round institution at Trillium in southern Oregon, and its goal is to foster a lifelong journey of learning and discovery within its participants; a lofty goal, but one that somehow seems possible within the magical folds of the Santa Ynez Hills.</p>\n<p>The annual gathering features music, art, culture and so much more. From diverse, healthy and ethical food to massive themed villages to comprehensive and intriguing workshops, the festival seems to breathe with a certain life energy throughout each facet of its being. Among the event’s seven village themes are “Warriors Way,” offering workshops on self-defense and survival skills, a “Healing Sanctuary” featuring various holistic medicinal practices and the warm and snuggly “Lovers’ Nest,” which looks to be a setup for a gigantic cuddle puddle. There is also an outlet for kids at Lucidity in the “Family Garden,” in which children can experience the festival through structured workshops, playshops, art, music and food exhibitions. This April, thousands of curious souls will wander to a massive joining of spirits and of communal energy right here in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Haas describes it as “a heart opening experience” and “an opportunity to play, to grow and to dream.” When reflecting upon the events of the past few months, our current political landscape has proven taxing on the psyches of many of us here in Santa Barbara, and a rejuvenating experience like Lucidity could do us all a spot of good. For some, this massive festival may just be the next big party, for others it could be “the nurturing communal experience they’ve been yearning for” and for others still the path to their truly actualized self may lie within Lucidity’s oak-shrouded borders. Only those who venture to Live Oak Campground this April will know for sure.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75911\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75911\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-23/lucidity-fest-coming-to-sb-this-spring/","id":6538,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6537,6536,6535],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Yuja Wang and Company Take Granada By Storm","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The audience filed back in and the two virtuosos re-emerged, Kavakos unchanged and Wang now draped in a slinky, subdued green evening dress.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Granada was ablaze with fervent virtuosity this week as Yuja Wang and Leonidas Kavakos filled the theatre for a night of intensity and longing on Monday, Feb. 13. Wang, whom the San Francisco Chronicle called “the most dazzlingly, uncannily gifted pianist in the concert world today,” alongside Kavakos, whose violin talents recently secured him the Léonie Sonning Music Prize, performed pieces by Janácek, Schubert, Debussy and Bartok as part of UCSB’s Arts &amp; Lectures series.</p>\n<p>Wang took to the stage in a resplendent glow, sporting four-inch stilettos and a tight, elegant dress that looked as if it were made of nothing but smoke and gold leaf. She has built up quite the reputation for stylish-yet-risqué outfits that allegedly get under some critics’ skin but simply lead me to think of her as the Rihanna of the concert piano world.  Kavakos, in sharp contrast, emerged solemn and subdued in a button-down and slacks. He would have fit just as well in a Silicon Valley startup office as on the stage, and this contrast foreshadowed the dynamic and complex ways the duo’s musical styles would interact throughout the night.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_75764\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"37285325\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"75763\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-75764\" data-attachment-id=\"75764\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/yuja-wang/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Yuja Wang\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of PBS&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-75764\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang-250x167.jpg?resize=250%2C167\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/yuja-wang.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-75764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of PBS</p></div>\n<p>A violin sonata by Janácek started off the night, the technical difficulty of the piece immediately casting light on both Kavakos’s and Wang’s brute-force musical talent. However, the two seemed a bit tense during the first couple movements, and this rigidity meshed poorly with the already dissonant nature of Janácek’s piece. Luckily, by the third and fourth movements, they had settled into their respective grooves for the sonata’s triumphant yet melancholy climax.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Schubert’s “Fantasie in C Minor” followed, providing a welcome reprieve from the tension of the previous piece. The audience’s hopes soared alongside Kavakos’s nimble bow as he weaved a verdant tapestry of sound and light in the Granada’s expanse. Wang’s nimble fingers supplied the backdrop to the magical expanse, the Middle Earth to Kavakos’s quest for the ring, as it were. Afterward there was a short intermission, at which I overheard one patron remarking that, “this theater is run by a bunch of extortionists, I mean can you believe it, $9 for a glass of unremarkable chardonnay? They’re just playing off of people’s insecurities about talking to strangers at intermissions, like of course we’re going to get a drink, what choice do we have?” The disgruntled man wished to remain anonymous.</p>\n<p>The audience filed back in and the two virtuosos re-emerged, Kavakos unchanged and Wang now draped in a slinky, subdued green evening dress. She must have transmuted some of her visual pizazz into musical zeal, as her performance on Debussy’s “Sonata in G Minor” elicited gasps and murmurs from the audience. As she squeezed every last drop of emotion from the Steinway’s lower register, I was shaken by vibrations in my liver itself. Or maybe another organ close to the liver.</p>\n<p>Kavakos and Wang polished off the night with Bartok’s “Sonata No.1 in C# Minor,” a piece that would no doubt make any but the most accomplished of performers quake in their loafers. This sonic rollercoaster bore some resemblance to the Janácek piece from earlier in the night, but where the former felt constricted and claustrophobic, the duo’s nightcap exploded in a cacophony of unrestrained chaos and energy. Drowsing patrons could be seen jerking upright in their seats at the stab of a minor chord or the wail of Kavakos’s strings. The intensity continued to build and build before releasing itself in ecstatic, frenetic climax leaving both performers and audience awake, gasping and perhaps a little sweaty. At one point, I began to suspect that Yuja Wang doesn’t have hands at all, and instead performs with a pair of motion-blurs on the ends of her arms like electrons whipping around inside valence shells. Although it’s not their first performance on the Arts &amp; Lectures circuit, it’s safe to say that Wang and Kavakos will not soon be forgotten by the Santa Barbara concert scene.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75763\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75763\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-16/yuja-wang-and-company-take-granada-by-storm/","id":6709,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6708,6707,6706],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Morrissey Lights Santa Barbara Aglow for Dia de Los Muertos","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/morissey.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/morissey.jpg?resize=699%2C578&ssl=1","description":"As I passed a group of sequin-clad skeletons savaging a Donald Trump piñata, something occurred to me: Morrissey couldn’t have picked a better event to play.

On Saturday, the plainly commercial space of the Santa Barbara Bowl was awash in a tide of local culture, and the walkway up from the front gate to the concert stage was transformed into a vertical street festival. Altars dedicated to lost loved ones flickered under the candlelight, and stray flower petals seemed to dance aloft on the voices and hands of missing friends. Tributes to fallen idols were in abundance; I teared up a little as I passed two candy skulls painted in the likenesses of David Bowie and Prince. Our own KCSB even had a small shrine dedicated to the programmers that have passed on over the years. In a patio area halfway up the slope, as I passed a group of sequin-clad skeletons savaging a Donald Trump piñata, something occurred to me: Morrissey couldn’t have picked a better event to play.<br>\nAs I stood in the pit waiting for Moz, music videos and movie clips lit up a gigantic projector screen behind the stage. The mixture of Sex Pistols, New York Dolls, James Dean and Cher made it immediately clear that these had been selected by the man himself. When he finally did take the stage along with a band of dashing young skeleton men in shirtless tuxedos, the crowd responded like drought victims in a rainstorm. He immediately dove into “How Soon Is Now?” and the tremolo set us all rippling. It was a smart call for the opening song, as the dominant sentiment in the audience was something along the lines of, “I’d throw myself in front of a bus for Steven Patrick Morrissey, but he had better play some goddamn Smiths tunes.” Alyssa, a senior at Cal Poly, echoed these sentiments after the show saying she was, “very stoked on him, but he was a bit of a tease. I [wanted] more Smiths.”<br>\nAfter the cheering died down, he quipped, “I sure hope you all enjoy yourselves, because you’re all royally screwed come Tuesday.”  A Cheshire grin flashed across his face as the crowd erupted once more. Mozmania had officially set in, and he could now say essentially anything he wished.  Luckily he (usually) uses this power for good, and after a couple of songs the charming man paused, and the screen behind him lit up once more.  As he sung the opening lines of “Ganglord,” harrowing scenes of police brutality played out behind him. Men in riot gear dashed people’s heads against walls and shot dogs in the street, and the number of fists raised around me made it clear these scenes were all too familiar to the crowd. A round of sober applause sounded out as the last image of an officer smiling behind a riot mask faded to black.<br>\nMorrissey was quick to liven up the audience again, starting up with a cover of the Ramones’ “Judy Is a Punk” leading into “You’re the One For Me, Fatty” and “Ouija Board,” two of his solo classics.  Afterward, he performed several of his newer songs, and I admit the show might’ve lagged (musically) at this point. However, Mozzer’s signature brand of animal magnetism seemed to carry us all through the middle. The entire time, eager fans attempted to catapult themselves onstage only to be intercepted mid-flight by a group of expert bouncers. One man in a full skeleton costume was able to make it all the way and gave Morrissey a tender bear hug before a baldheaded man in a polo shirt sprang like a puma from stage right and whisked him away.<br>\nBefore the set’s finale, the Irish crooner took the time to thank his band, whom he described as “the best platoon from here to the moon.” They all bowed reverently and then polished off the crowd with “Everyday Is Like Sunday” and “First of the Gang to Die.” Morrissey’s dulcet tones were drowned out by a chorus of tearful voices, but not a soul complained. He gave the crowd a coy wave as he and the band left the stage, everyone in attendance knowing full well that the pause before the encore was mere formality. In another calculated move, Moz finished with the raucous Smiths tune “What She Said,” making a heady and frenzied end to the performance. As I walked back down past all of the altars, candles now blown out, I knew that Morrissey had done right by the spirit of the Day of the Dead. He’d awoken a light in all those watching that would never go out.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74106\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74106\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-10/morrissey-lights-santa-barbara-aglow-for-dia-de-los-muertos/","id":6719,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6718,6717,6716],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Arlington Laps Up a Case of James Blake","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The audience eagerly followed Blake’s every move as he led them through a maze of his works, both old and new.

As a curtain of fog swirled beneath their feet, a singular point of light oscillated back and forth across a great black backdrop. Like Blake’s music, it was minimal yet incredibly transfixing.</p>\n<p>The audience eagerly followed Blake’s every move as he led them through a maze of his works, both old and new. “I’m gonna try and play some of my newer material,” he announced before diving into his famous cover of Feist’s “Limit to Your Love” from his self-titled debut back in 2011. This is how James Blake operates; he sets up rules for the listener, and then shatters them into millions of glittering bits almost immediately after they’ve been formed. During “Modern Soul,” for example, a pulsing white rectangle we’d grown to accept as a central part of Blake’s backdrop suddenly rotated into a brilliant, multicolored ring, leaving everyone in the room subsumed in the best possible way.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although they were originally intent on retaining their air of ruthless politeness, the crowd of sedate Santa Barbarans were finally pulled from their theater seats during his <em>excellent</em> remix of U.K. dubstep act Untold’s “Stop What You’re Doing.” According SB local David Shin, “We didn’t expect this type of energy!

The tawny synth maestro clearly loves putting on a show (I’d never known the Clavia Nord 4 to be a full-bodied instrument!), but after spending a set in his presence you get the feeling he’s there for the audience, not for himself. However, Blake’s musical performance really only made for half of the concert experience. The background visuals by abstract artist Matt Clark — current creative director of United Visual Artists — were perfect ekphrases of Blake’s sound. When coupled with intricate lighting changes of every shape and color on the spectrum, they made for the most thoroughly audio-visual experience I’ve ever witnessed. Apart from a minor technical which incited Blake to charmingly scrap a song in the middle of it, the performance went off without a hitch.</p>\n<p>Nearing the show’s finale, Blake and the band finally gave into chants from the front few rows, tiptoeing their way into 2013’s “Retrograde,” Blake’s most popular track. No matter how many times you listen to it, there’s always a certain subtlety to Blake’s sound; it sneaks up on you. Even though everyone in attendance knew this track by heart, when it finally swelled into the chorus it was as if we were standing at the feet of an eclipse.</p>\n<p>Paying homage to his long-time fans as well as his own roots, Blake finished the set with “The Wilhelm Scream” from his aforementioned self-titled. The song is a cover of one his father, James Litherland, wrote. Even through the electric fervor and downtempo drum rhythms, you can really hear the affection in Blake’s voice. Through Blake’s traditional style of minimalist repetition, the song builds upon a wall of soothing reverb like a set of waves gradually overtaking a shore. The end result is a wall of noise reminiscent of one of My Bloody Valentine’s famous “holocaust sections,” but with the intent of melting the audience into a puddle of their own sentiments rather than reducing them to dust.</p>\n<p>After a scant few minutes of frenzied cheers, Blake returned by his lonesome to perform a serene, two-song encore. As his solemn silhouette casually lit up the empty backdrop, he serenaded us with his cover of Joni Mitchell’s “A Case of You,” leaving more than a few eyes in the room in a state of pleasant dampness.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73315\" style=\"width: 4414px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1575840009\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"73364\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73315\" data-attachment-id=\"73315\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/james-blake-arlington-theatre-oct-18th-2016/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=4404%2C3146&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4404,3146\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"James Blake, Arlington Theatre, Oct  18th 2016.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=250%2C179&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?fit=888%2C634&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-73315 size-full\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/James-Blake-Concert_Hari-Patel_10182016-489120.jpg?resize=888%2C634\" alt=\"James Blake, Arlington Theatre, Oct 18th 2016.

So do you think you could … let this one just be me?”</p>\n<p>As I sat there mulling over how I’d never be asked to <em>shut the fuck up</em> so pleasantly again in my life, Blake, voice alone, began spinning the first verses of “Measurements.”</p>\n<p>“God damn …” a man in front of me whispered, clearly struggling to contain his whoops of pleasure. In the most wonderfully masturbatory show of musicianship I’d ever seen, Blake proceeded to harmonize with himself six or seven times over, his vocal cords weaving a veritable tapestry of sound. These voices then gradually trickled off one by one as people stooped down to grab their jackets and purses, and Blake’s set closed gracefully like the bud of a morning glory at dusk.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-73364\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-73364\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-20/arlington-laps-up-a-case-of-james-blake/","id":6747,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6746,6745,6744],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Max Goldenstein Serenades Batcave","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-9.09.51-PM-e1460018142359.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-9.09.51-PM-e1460018142359.png?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"On the bright Sunday morning of March 6, the Daily Nexus was joined by Isla Vista musician-slash-rugged heartthrob Max Goldenstein for a session in the Batcave.

You folks may know him as the front man of local garage rock group Sun Daes, frequent headliners at the backyard parties and park concerts you know and love. Their voluptuous, groovy sound has made them one of I.V.’s most memorable bands, accommodating equal amounts of jiving and thrashing from their listeners.</p>\n<p>However, Max has a budding and ambitious solo career as well; with material up on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/max-17\">Soundcloud</a> and <a href=\"https://aqualounge.bandcamp.com/releases\">Bandcamp</a>, his extremely varied style blends elements of electro, psych, folk and lounge music into a heady brew of sonic delight. His quick wit and merry, easy-going disposition come out in his lyrics to great effect, and anyone who’s spent more than a month in I.V. should be able to relate to his words. We sat down to an interview together, after he’d finished playing:</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Daily Nexus</em>: So, how does playing on your own differ from playing with the band? Is there one you like more than the other?</p>\n<p>Max Goldenstein: No … no, I don’t think so; they both have different things about them that are good and stuff that’s bad. We’re all great friends, so it’s amazing playing and being up there [with them] and there’s definitely a groove you can get into. When you’re in a band, though, it’s not just your sound, it’s all of yours; you have to be willing to compromise. When I’m on my own, though, there’s definitely … there’s a freedom that comes with that. I can explore my own ideas for songs and lyrics and all that.</p>\n<p>DN: Have you ever thought about picking up a backing band or something like that?</p>\n<p>MG: I have, yeah, but there are problems you run into. It basically means finding people — drums, bass, whatever — who don’t have a problem taking more of a backseat position. They have to be okay with playing <em>your</em> music. What that means, I think, is that the band probably shouldn’t be their central thing — their only thing. I’m still looking right now, actually. Can you actually put that in the article?</p>\n<p>DN: Yeah, of course.</p>\n<p>MG: Thanks.</p>\n<p>DN: Do you think you want to keep on doing music as a career?</p>\n<p>MG: Well sure, I mean, that’s the dream, right? I’d love to spend the rest of my life in the studio and playing shows and touring and shit — all that stuff’s really … I really enjoy it. But being able to share my music with other people — with the world — that’s what’s important for me. The music scene, it’s a really hard place to continuously make money in, so a lot of what I’ve been thinking about is how to make money, at least enough to live on, while I can keep writing and performing. So having a job that I like, something cool — that’s why I’m in marine bio — to pay for food and rent and all that so I can do what I really want in my own time; I think I’d be fine with that, too.</p>\n<p>DN: Definitely, yeah. I know that’s something a lot of people here are wrestling with. Taking things back into more of a local view, what do you think is unique about being a band in Isla Vista, as opposed to someplace else?</p>\n<p>MG: I think … I think it’s really unique to be in a community made up almost entirely of inspired kids who not only want to have fun, but are trying to go after their passions. The arts scene here, it’s really special. I’ve met some of my favorite people here and I’ve seen some crazy shit. I don’t think you could go anywhere else and find the same number of — and how huge they are —the parties and shows around here! It’s a fucking crazy place to be in a band. There’s always somewhere you can play.</p>\n<p>DN: And for either you yourself or the band, do you think living in I.V. has shaped your sound at all?</p>\n<p>MG: Oh definitely, yeah. It’s like I was saying: I.V.’s such a unique place that it makes for really great inspiration; there’s plenty of song material here. It’s also a brilliant place for just fucking around, and we do a lot of that and I feel like that’s reflected in the music we make.</p>\n<p>DN: Nice, nice. And now while our readers do love to hear about the music, they also want the dish. So I gotta ask, what were you listening to in middle school?</p>\n<p>MG: Oh god. Uh, gimme a sec … Avenged Sevenfold, I guess? Rise Against? All that shit … I think I had one Slipknot song at one point.</p>\n<p>DN: My Chemical Romance?</p>\n<p>MG: Hahahaha, oh sure, yeah.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69618\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69618\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-07/max-goldenstein-serenades-batcave/","id":6781,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6780,6779,6778],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Finest Hours” Interview with Casey Affleck and Ben Pine","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Film and TV","publish_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/maxresdefault.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/maxresdefault.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“The Finest Hours” premiered in theaters on Friday, Jan. 29.

The film tells the story of the rescue of the S.S. Pendleton, one of the most daring rescue missions in the history of the Coast Guard. When the ship is split in two by a ferocious storm off the coast of Chatham, MA, coxswain Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine) sets out in a lifeboat in extremely treacherous conditions to rescue the survivors. Thanks to the efforts of Webber and chief engineer Raymond Sybert (played by Casey Affleck), 32 out of 33 of the Pendleton’s crew members were rescued. The <em>Daily Nexus, </em>along with several other collegiate publications, spoke with Affleck and Pine about the film:</p>\n<p> </p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><strong>Daily Nexus:</strong> You’ve done quite a few films in the New England/Boston area. What exactly is it that draws you back to your hometown, and how did your familiarity with the area affect the filming process?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> That’s a good question. I guess I like coming back here just because I’m from here. It’s nice to come home. I’m in California for the time being so I can work; that’s where the industry is. But I’d much rather be here. Boston is also a great place to make movies ‘cause they’ve been making movies here for a long time. They’ve got really good crews there, which is not always the case. And you know, everyone’s professional, and also when the movie comes out and you run into the people who you made it with from Boston, people in Boston don’t mind telling you if they hated it. So it’s nice to know, you know, where you stand. And you don’t have to guess about whether or not they actually liked it or not. That was a joke.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Growing up in Boston, were you familiar with the story of the Pendleton’s rescue before your experience with the film?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> I hadn’t heard it before. I’m not totally sure that it’s true. But they say it is, you know, and I guess that’s enough to make a movie, you know. When I — when I did a little research, I was skeptical. I went to the Coast Guard Museum and turns out it all really happened. It’s quite an amazing story. It’s great when you can find totally forgotten [stories] like this that really you could write a book about. You could bring cheer to the story in a lot of ways. But these days, movies are pretty great for making a spectacle, you know. All the amazing things that they can do now in movies. They can really bring something like this to life, the scale of which would be hard to imagine if it weren’t a movie. No matter how much I heard about it or read about it, I was still really surprised by how big the ship was and, you know, just like what that — to think how big those waves must have been to split a 500 foot Oil Tanker in half. It’s the kind of thing you want to see someone make a movie of so you can go watch it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Hey, I just wanted to know how the film being set in 1952, how that changed your approach to the performance?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> Well that’s a good question. There’s a lot of conversation about whether or not we try to emulate the style — the acting style — the movies from that period, because stylistically the movie looks and feels a lot like a movie from back then, albeit also sort of, you know, color and gigantic and sort of awesome in all of the ways that digital cinema is now. But in other ways, in the writing and storytelling, thematically, it sort of feels like an old movie. So should people behave that way as well? And we decided no. So really I just approach it like any other movie the as best you can.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Chris, you play Bernard Weber, who’s the main character of this film. What elements did you bring to your character to honor Weber’s legacy?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pine:</strong> Bernie Weber … what I like about Bernie, at least from the script that I was given and — I didn’t know Bernie and really had only a sense of who he was from talking to Andy Fitzgerald, who was on the boat with him that night, and Moe Gutthrew, who’s his best friend, and there’s an autobiographical account that Bernie wrote about the night, and then obviously the book <em>The Finest </em>and a little audio clip of Bernie describing the events of that night. So that was — those were kind of the things that I used to cull an idea of who the man might have been. But from the script that I was given, he was a simple guy that loved his job and loved the waters … and knew what he was doing out there but was obviously affected by a tragedy that happened a year before and didn’t know if he was up for the task of going out that night. But I … do love the idea of a regular man up against seemingly insurmountable odds, and more than anything, I kind of related to Bernie’s fear, you know. Bernie is a man that wears his heart on his sleeve. And he’s not like many of us that, you know, put on all this armor and try to be macho and tough. He’s just — Bernie doesn’t — at least from the script that was given — doesn’t think that way. He just kind of wears his heart on his sleeve, wants to do a good job and loves his wife.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Bernie’s character was a really huge rule follower in the film at the beginning. And then at the end, he kind of learned the limits of being a rule follower and kind of broke away from that. Were there any situations in your life where you have broken the rules or taken risks in acting or in life?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Pine:</strong> Nothing that comes to mind. But that seems to be that theme of, you know, we all like stories of the mavericks and the guys that, I don’t know, go against the grain, and I think what we enjoy about men like that is they usually operate from the sense of an inner moral compass. And I think part of Bernie’s evolution — it’s not that following rules are bad, it’s just that Bernie, by following rules so closely, had lost his voice, and by learning to speak up for himself and to trust his instincts, trust his gut, trust his knowledge of those waters, I think — I think that’s really good. The story there — and although I can’t think of anything personally that comes to mind — I think all those kinds of experience that on a daily basis, balancing ourselves, understanding ourselves, communicating ourselves and you know, looking at whatever social framework which tries to—</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Affleck:</strong> What Chris is doing there is he’s telling some of the bigger themes of the picture. It’s about the inner compass of a man. There’s the compass, they lose their compass, and they still find their way because there’s an inner moral compass that guides them. The guiding light here, for Disney, for Chris, for all of us: it’s selflessness, heroism in the face of 50 foot waves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“The Finest Hours,” which has been called a highly invigorating crowd pleaser and a tale of nautical derring-do, is now playing in theaters nationwide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68010\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68010\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-02-09/finest-hours-interview-with-casey-affleck-and-ben-pine/","id":5898,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[5897,5896,5895],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Preview: Lemaitre Coming to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img-lemaitre_121354411982-e1453948400792.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/img-lemaitre_121354411982-e1453948400792.jpg?resize=800%2C533&ssl=1","description":"It may be true to say that electronic music has never been bigger than it is today.

Massive festivals like EDC, Tomorrowland and Electric Zoo dominate the festival-scape, and even more traditional events like Coachella are scrambling to fit electronic acts at the top of their lineups. Due to the dominance of big-name acts and the sea of people spewing music out onto SoundCloud from their laptops, it can often be hard for smaller EDM, dance or techno groups to make a name for themselves in the industry. However Norway-based duo Lemaitre have done just that and on the eve of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U-aDUXpre0\">next album drop</a>, Jan. 28 they will bring their funky electronic magic to the stage at Santa Barbara’s SOhO music club.</p>\n<p>Lemaitre is made up of high school mates Ketil Jansen and Ulrik Denizou Lund. Both in early 20s the two have been making music together since 2010. Their funkadelic, guitar-and-synth-driven style of electronica brings to mind 2000s techno greats like Daft Punk as well as deep and tropical house acts like Fingers Inc. and Kygo. Honestly, it’s music that makes you feel pretty good about yourself and the several inches of air or sweaty flesh around your head. It also demands that you bob in place from side to side like one of those <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bluw-B00G1063-Solar-Dancing-Cactus/dp/B001FRAGDI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8\">solar-powered dancing cactuses</a>. Listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqkzR0sdtuU\">this</a>. It’s impossible not to.</p>\n<p>While their incredible musicianship and production talents are both worthy of marvel, one of the most unique aspects of Lemaitre is their ability to deftly navigate the landscape of the music industry in the internet age. The duo release all of their music <em>for free </em>on their <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/serious-url\">SoundCloud</a>, and in doing so completely negate the issue of piracy hurting their ability to make a living. They’ve generated a massive fan base through a very active social media presence, especially on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lemaitremusic\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lemaitremusic\">Twitter</a>. This has led to their massive success in recent years, most notably in getting signed to Astralwerks Records, home of industry giants Porter Robinson and Deadmau5.

Their upcoming album, <em>1749,</em> derives its name from the number of their new house, where they created all of their recent material. And, oh, what new music they’ve created. Just a few days ago, Lemaitre released <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b1x_HWGh-4\">Nishio 2</a>, a collaboration with Giraffage, as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5z8ONuMmOU\">Closer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JummLIQcG4\">Stepping Stone</a>, two tracks from <em>1749</em>. Their newer material shows the duo moving away from some of their more funk and nu-disco based influences and closer toward their collaborators and compadres in the electro house scene.</p>\n<p>Lemaitre is expected to blow the walls off of SOhO with their decadent and dripping synth melodies, Jan. 28 at 8 p.m. There’s also a pretty good chance they’ll have <a href=\"http://odyssey.antiochsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/photo-33.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1585571375\" data-slb-group=\"67698\">this really sweet light-up origami thing</a> behind them, so that should be cool to see, too.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67698\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/preview-lemaitre-coming-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67698\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/preview-lemaitre-coming-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/preview-lemaitre-coming-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/preview-lemaitre-coming-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-27/preview-lemaitre-coming-to-soho/","id":6823,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6822,6821,6820],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kurupt Brings the G-Funk Back to Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kurupt.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kurupt.png?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"“Every single person in this club could beat me up.” This was my first experience with the Velvet Jones.

I was immediately greeted with a spotlight glare glinting off of some guy’s grills. The club was packed and the dance floor was bumping with classic R&amp;B. I was surrounded by hardened reps from about a dozen different entertainment companies and enough ice to supply the props for “Blood Diamond.” To even further add to the intense atmosphere of the place, half of the girls in the club were wearing Jason masks repping their favorite groups.</p>\n<p>I soon discovered why the crowd was so intense — half of them were opening acts. The DJ stopped spinning and the first group took the stage. From what I could tell their name was “One Hitter Quitter Dome Splitter,” but that very well could have been a line of weed products they were promoting. This theory was bolstered by the fact that their front man was essentially a carbon copy of Jesse Pinkman.</p>\n<p>Regrettably I couldn’t keep track of the rest of the openers’ names, partially because they were all pretty fucked up and partially because there were <em>eight</em> of them. The crowd grew as tired as I did, and by the fifth act most of them had retreated to the bar to save their strength for Kurupt.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Finally at about 10:30 p.m., the DJs stepped back and Kurupt emerged from the back room with an entourage of about 20. The crowd absolutely lost their heads when the party came out, mostly because Young Gotti’s entourage included Death Row legends (and fellow Dogg Pound members) Daz Dillinger and RBX. After the party took the stage, Kurupt immediately began spitting fire. He performed a mix of his older G-Funk material and his more recent stuff, and did so with the deliverance of a howitzer cannon. He was joined alternatingly by Daz and RBX, and the chemistry between them all was immediately apparent. These are rappers whose relationships to one another as performers and artists had been hardened by two decades in the game together.</p>\n<p>Up-and-coming R&amp;B singer Shantay joined the fray partway through the show, and her soulful, striking voice completely cut through the grumble of the crowd. The ladies in the club perked up noticeably, as they finally got the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrMrqBcv6Mk\">slow jamz</a> they were looking for. Towards the end, the reason for the unconventional show structure and the onslaught of opening acts became clear — I was at someone’s birthday party! The man’s name was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidorosco805\">David Orosco</a>, and I guess he’s one of the owners of the Ventura-based merch company <a href=\"http://cuzzaloink.com/\">Cuzzalo Ink</a>. They’re in the business of making custom masks for hip hop artists and the like, so that explained the masquerade vibes I was getting from the crowd. David was up onstage chilling with Young Gotti and they were all passing around blunts and forties, so it seems like he got the old-fashioned gangsta party he was looking for.</p>\n<p>Before signing off for the night, Kurupt and Daz finally donned the blank white T-shirts of Tha Dogg Pound. They finished off their set with two of DPG’s best songs from back in the day: “New York, New York” and “What Would U Do.” These songs hit the crowd just as hard as they hit mid-‘90s L.A., and in those moments the word “bumpin’” was redefined. Every single person in the house knew the lyrics, and you’d be hard-pressed not to find someone with at least one hand in the air. This definitely hyped up the crowd for Tha Dogg Pound’s announcement at the show’s conclusion that they are coming back for another album.</p>\n<p>After the show, the trio held a meet-and-greet backstage for people with special VIP tickets. I didn’t have one of those, but I managed to get backstage courtesy of one of the club’s promoters, Chase. I’d been in the back room all of two seconds when some dude grabbed me by the shoulder, said, “Yo, you’re next” and shoved me up onto a platform with a wall of cameras to my back and three hip hop legends (and personal friends of Tupac Shakur holy shit) in front of me. My mouth made a bunch of weird, soundless shapes instead of the words I was looking for, but I managed to dap each of them while my brain got its shit together. As I turned around to make a presumably dumb-looking face for the cameras, I managed to sputter out a request for a quote about the show.</p>\n<p>“One hunded.”</p>\n<p>And that’s all she wrote.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU5EUAh8q34</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67377\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/kurupt-brings-the-g-funk-back-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67377\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/kurupt-brings-the-g-funk-back-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/kurupt-brings-the-g-funk-back-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/kurupt-brings-the-g-funk-back-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-14/kurupt-brings-the-g-funk-back-to-velvet-jones/","id":6842,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6841,6840,6839],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kurupt To Come to Velvet Jones","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kurupt.jpg?resize=300%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kurupt.jpg?resize=300%2C400&ssl=1","description":"After the release of last year’s “Straight Outta Compton,” public interest in the G-funk era is at its highest in over a decade.

Along with industry titans Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, Kurupt was one of the closest to the history (and infamy) created at Death Row Records. Making up one half of Death Row powerhouse Tha Dogg Pound (along with Daz Dillinger) Kurupt is largely responsible for the release of one of the label’s most prolific records: 1995’s <em>Dogg Food</em>. This Friday night at 8 p.m., we have a rare chance to see this living legend at Velvet Jones.</p>\n<p>Born and raised in Philadelphia, Kurupt was recruited by Death Row early on in his rapping career in the early nineties. One of the Death Row family’s core members, Kurupt was featured heavily on both Dr. Dre’s <em>The Chronic</em> and Snoop Dogg’s <em>Doggystyle</em>. Here, he and Dillinger developed the close professional and personal relationship that evolved into Tha Dogg Pound. <em>Dogg Food</em>’s triple-platinum success is impressive on its own and even more so given the fact that it was the first Death Row record not produced by Dre.</p>\n<p>After <em>Dogg Food</em>’s release and his departure from Death Row following the death of Tupac Shakur, Kurupt’s success as a solo artist eclipsed the later efforts of Tha Dogg Pound. <em>Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey </em>continues to be his most successful solo record, and remains influential to many in the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Kurupt later returned to Death Row to serve as their V.P. in the late ’90s after Suge Knight’s release from prison, and during that time he assumed the role of their primary solo artist. Since then, he has released several LPs, been featured in several films and now has <a href=\"http://www.sfevergreen.com/kurupts-moon-rocks-a-bud-out-of-this-world/\">his own line of cannabis products</a><u>.</u></p>\n<p>More notable than Kurupt’s public success, however, is his lasting influence throughout hip-hop. Known as a “rapper’s rapper,” Kurupt wields a flow that is equal parts smooth and hard-hitting. His verses consistently <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/16653949\">body all of the others</a> on any track he’s put on. Kurupt’s intensity, energy and complex rhyme structure make him one of Kendrick Lamar’s top three influences (along with Tupac and Ice Cube). An undoubtedly integral member of the West Coast G-funk scene, Kurupt is one of the unsung heroes of rap, and it would be a mistake to miss him this Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-67244\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/kurupt-to-come-to-velvet-jones/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-67244\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/kurupt-to-come-to-velvet-jones/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/kurupt-to-come-to-velvet-jones/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/kurupt-to-come-to-velvet-jones/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-01-07/kurupt-to-come-to-velvet-jones/","id":6837,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6836,6835,6834],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"!!!

For one night only, the Bowl became a magical arena, shaped after the traditional Day of the Dead festivities of Oaxaca, Mexico, where the boundary between the worlds of the living and not-so-living get a good deal thinner. It was a community event for all ages, featuring dance and cultural performances by Danza Azteca, Chinelo Dancers and Ballet Folklorico as well as many influential and exciting Latin bands such as Kinky, Bomba Estéreo, La Santa Cecilia and Chicano Batman. There was also mariachi bands roaming the crowds, installations and altars created by local schools and museums, Aztec dancers and skeleton face-painting.

It’s a lot of electronica, with Latin music, also with some rock and some very traditional Mexican elements, which makes [Kinky] a very danceable music.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Nexus</em>: As the keys player in the band, I was wondering how much of a role you played in bringing out the band’s, uh, I guess more techno sound?</p>\n<p>Lozano: Each one of us has a very different style of music that they listen to, I listen to a lot of electronica and a lot of Mexican, traditional Mexican music from the north part of Mexico, Ranchero, Norteño, Banda, a lot of that, yeah, but a lot of electronic music as well. I love, like you mentioned, techno music from Germany, I love also a lot of the UK drum and bass sound as well and house music too … I think that’s a lot of what I express in our music and in my role in Kinky.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Nexus</em>: Awesome, and how do you guys — I don’t know if you can speak for the rest of the band — but how do you feel about the state of the electronic music scene today in America, with the whole big festival culture?</p>\n<p>Lozano: I think it’s the greatest moment of electronic music in history, and I can kind of feel that way in how electronic music has been very big in like, waves through history. It had a very big wave in the eighties, with all the pop electronic music and all those pop bands that came out in the eighties. And then in the nineties we had a comeback with more of the trip-hop scene that everyone was very into, and then we had another explosion in the late 90s-early 00s with a lot of DJ’s like Paul Oakenfold and Sasha and all those big names. They fade in and then they fade out again, and then in like 2010 and 2012 it all just blew up with the whole dubstep scene, and everything like house, deep house, acid house and techno were brought together into these big hits. Now all of the hits of 2014 and 2015 are all electronic! And now it’s very interesting to see how all of the big festivals now are starting to have a stage for electronica, and the electronic festivals are even starting to become the more important ones right now if you look at how many people are attending. For us to have [electronica] as one of our more important or prominent sounds, it’s very good for us right now. It helps us get more festivals, more invitations to play concerts and it’s great — we love playing festivals, the raves, and all of that stuff.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Nexus</em>: Switching gears now, you’ve mentioned the band’s duality before, and coming out of Monterrey as a city. It’s my understanding that it’s a fairly business-centric place, only about a couple hours from the border, and I was wondering how Monterrey as a city has had an influence on the music as well?</p>\n<p>Lozano: Yeah, I mean it’s exactly that. Monterrey is a part of the sound of Kinky, the band couldn’t come with that sound out of anywhere else. It’s a very strong Monterrey influence. Monterrey is an incredible city, it has so much talent and so many musicians in the scene, and everybody’s supporting each other. No matter what you are doing, it’s also a city where a lot of people from all over the world go to study, so it’s full of young people and students, so that also helps projects and groups to develop. That’s how we were able to be heard in Mexico, because the scene in Monterrey was supporting so many of their own bands like Control Machete or even El Gran Silencio, or Plastilina Mosh, or Kinky, this is where we were performing every weekend, in Monterrey’s downtown part, which is called Barrio Antiguo, so everybody was playing there with their own bands and had their own different sounds. One was hip hop, another electronica, one was alternative, another was straight rock, so everybody was making their own sound and that’s how everybody came out of Monterrey at the end of the 90s/early 2000s. It’s so rich in culture and is also very important in the finance and economics of Mexico as a country. That’s something that makes it a very important place to come out of.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Nexus</em>: Have you ever played any concerts for the Dia de los Muertos before?</p>\n<p>Lozano: Well yeah, it’s a very common tradition in Mexico to celebrate, so we have done shows with that celebration before. It’s great to be playing all these big festivals and shows, and also to be able to take that culture and bring it to celebrations down in Mexico and to people in the states and other Latin bands, and to be a part of something like this. It’s great to be able to show [everyone] how we celebrate down in Mexico.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Nexus</em>: Well thank you so much for taking the time to speak to me, I’m looking forward to being at the show!

The crowd was older than that of most Santa Barbara Bowl shows, although it was uplifting to see a spattering of young, crunchy, activist-types as well. There were many ex-flower child parents accompanied by eye-rolling teenagers.</p>\n<p>Resting in the sylvan scene was a gathering of activism booths termed “Neil’s Village,” with organizations in line with Young’s long-standing reputation for standing up for the American farmer. Representatives were present from farm justice groups such as Beneficial Insects, Permaculture Magazine, the Hollywood Food Guild/Center for Food Safety and a group fighting to overturn Citizens United and end corporate personhood called Move to Amend.</p>\n<p>Diana Reeves, Executive Director of GMO Free USA, who is on tour with Young, said, “He does have a Heart of Gold. I’ve cried before every concert.” Maybe the heroic troubadour was as kind in person as his music might lead listeners to believe. GMO Free USA is the leading GMO activist organization in the nation, advocating a higher standard of transparency and ethics in the food industry.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>A small sign served as the only disruption in the idyllic grove, and it spelled out every concertgoer’s worst nightmare: “Show delayed until 7:30.” This was an hour after the show was scheduled.</p>\n<p>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the stage darkened and simply dressed farmer women walked onto the stage, scattering seeds from small wicker baskets. Suddenly, in response to the eagerly chanting crowd, the spotlight illuminated Young himself sitting at a beat-down wooden piano on the corner of the stage. For a multiplatinum artist, he really did look unassuming, not even taking center stage in his show and appearing dressed in a wide-brimmed black hat, well-worn flannel, jeans and hiking shoes.</p>\n<p>He began the show solo with “After the Gold Rush,” and his voice sounded just as tender and heartfelt as it did upon the album’s release. When Young blew his first soul-wrenching note, the harmonica cut right through the sweaty concert air and the crowd responded with an enthusiastic scream.</p>\n<p>After the first four solo songs, the stage darkened for an unexpected bit of theatrics: Toxic green LEDs lit up the base of the stage in stark contrast to Young’s naturalist aesthetic, and gas-masked and hazmat-suited villains trudged onto the stage spraying smoke out of pesticide fumers. While some definitely found the effects over-the-top, I thought they were well-executed and harkened back to the stage theatrics of classic rock ’n’ roll. These dark heralds preceded the entrance of Promise of the Real, Young’s backing band for this tour and recording mates for <em>The Monsanto Years</em>.</p>\n<p>Although they obviously had big shoes to fill (through an unavoidable Crazy Horse comparison), PotR delivered their performance with the fervor and zeal of any of the heavy-hitting folk-rock bands back in the days of old. The shining star of the group was Willie Nelson’s son Lukas, who posed a striking presence strumming a weather-beaten Les Paul. Nelson took over lead vocals on a cover of Kurt Weill’s “September Song,” and his crooning tones sounded like his father was being channeled through him on the duet with Young. Noticeably different was his brother Micah Nelson. Micah clearly looked out of place as his constant power jumps, camouflage snapback and skin-tight black muscle tee made the impression that he had gotten lost on the way to Warped Tour.</p>\n<p>The show’s first half consisted of several of Young’s classic hits including “Helpless,” “Out on the Weekend,” “Only Love Can Break Your Heart,” and “Alabama.” On “Words (Between the Lines of Age),” the crowd lost their heads at Young and Nelson’s screeching guitar riffs. The group delved into material off of Young’s most recent release, this summer’s <em>Monsanto Years</em>. The four-song block of unfamiliar material seemed to drag on quite a bit. Many of the lyrics from Young’s newest album come off a little heavy-handed (several songs included the band repeatedly droning “Monsaantoooooooo”), although the crowd seemed very passionate about the issues and replied with their usual repertoire of cheers and fist-pumps.</p>\n<p>Young moved back into his older material for the remainder of the show and really harkened back to his psychedelic influences during “Down by the River” and “Time Fades Away,” breaking off into several-minute trance-like jam sessions. I heard one presumably stoned older fan behind me whisper, “It’s like they’re back in their garage, maaaaan.” As the show neared a close, Young stopped the performance for a so-called activist “hootenanny.”</p>\n<p>You could tell this is where his passions really lie, as he spoke truly from the heart about a new California Seed Law prohibiting the sharing of seeds more than three miles from where they left the ground, adding a seriously crippling restriction to state farmers. Young began to throw packets of seeds into the audience, calling out for cops to “come up here and arrest me.” While this might not have been as glamorous as protesting the Vietnam War, it was incredibly inspiring to see someone as late in his career as Young fighting for the things he loves.</p>\n<p>Finishing off the show with “Love and Only Love,” Young announced that they were approaching the Bowl’s curfew, and had to go. Of course this was only a jest, and the band returned to the stage a couple of minutes later for the inevitable encore.</p>\n<p>“I certainly hope we offend somebody,” Young announced. “We’ve only got a couple more minutes before we <em>really</em> have to leave, so we’ll try our hardest to shorten this song as much as we can…”</p>\n<p>The band, of course, did nothing of the sort. The encore song was “F***in’ Up,” and the audience went absolutely bananas for it. Both Young and Lukas Nelson took multiple fearsome guitar solos mid-song and sounded like they had descended from Valhalla itself. It was clear the audience was in a total frenzy, as even the begrudging teens at the show were jumping and shouting their lungs out at the folk-rock legend.</p>\n<p>Somehow, Young managed to break every single string on his guitar by the end of the encore. It was clear at this point that the group was fully intent on messing with their imposed curfew as much as possible. Trying to stretch the show and stick it to the sedate Santa Barbarans suffering from sleepiness, the band put the guitar track on a feedback loop and proceeded to lay Young’s guitar to rest underneath his sweat-drenched flannel while Young spent a couple of minutes playing with the whammy bar. They then went around the stage watering all of their plants (very urgent business, of course), and left the stage with the feedback still ringing. Their hilarious disregard for regulations and authority left the audience in high spirits.</p>\n<p>The very … enthusiastic concertgoer by the name of Penny Lane said, “Game changer. Mind rubber. Every day I wish that he’ll pull me up on stage and he didn’t, but it was definitely a close one this time.”</p>\n<p>“Keep it Neil” was embroidered on the back of her fringe jacket. It was hard to deny a bolstered connection to Young after this touching performance.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGTzMvXTUiY</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65359\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65359\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/keep-it-neil/","id":6898,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6897,6896,6895],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Neil Young to Perform at Santa Barbara Bowl This Saturday","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/07892193-photo-neil-young.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/07892193-photo-neil-young.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Timeless purveyor of folk wisdom and noted environmental champion Neil Young has launched another world tour following the June release of his latest studio album, The Monsanto Years.

As part of this tour, the wind-burnt Canadian singer-songwriter will take the stage at SB’s Santa Barbara Bowl on Saturday, Oct. 10, along with newly formed backing band Promise of the Real.</p>\n<p>Born 70 years ago in Toronto, Canada, Young has assembled what could be called one of the longest and most prolific careers in modern folk music. Working with everyone from Rick James to Joni Mitchell, Young has developed an impressive collaborative catalog in addition to his solo work. His first period of musical success began in Los Angeles, with the formation of Buffalo Springfield; the group wrote one of the most popular protest songs of all time, “For What It’s Worth,” and has been partially credited in creating the genres of folk rock and country rock. Buffalo Springfield have since been inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, representing one of Young’s unbelievable two inductions.</p>\n<p>It is widely believed that Young’s best work flourished out of his extensive solo career, following the release of 1970’s heartstring-tugging powerhouse <em>After the Gold Rush</em> and 1972’s <em>Harvest</em>, which has been named as “Canada’s Best Album of All Time.” Both records are certified platinum in multiple countries and are largely responsible for Young’s induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Amidst intermittent hiatus and various experimental periods, the singer-songwriter has continued to release many hit singles throughout the past several decades, including “This Note’s For You” and “Rockin’ in the Free World.” The latter, a song critical of many of George H. W. Bush’s conservative policies as president, actually appeared in the news earlier this year when increasingly bumbling Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump played it at one of his campaign rallies, mistaking the song for a freedom-lovin’, American anthem.</p>\n<p>This world tour has received rave reviews so far. His backing band also deserves their share of the hype; Promise of the Real have an impressive repertoire of their own. Sporting two of Willie Nelson’s flesh-and-blood progeny, the group was heavily featured on this year’s <em>The Monsanto Years</em>. One reviewer reported, “The band plays like a younger, scrappier version of Young’s own Crazy Horse,” which is some of the highest praise a band backing Neil Young in this day and age could expect. The group is expected to cover a mix of Young’s older and newer material, and this is likely to be one of the Bowl’s most un-missable performances of the year. I’m sure even the concrete floor of the stadium will remember the spots where it was christened by drops of sweat from the brow of the Godfather of Grunge himself.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65030\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/neil-young-to-perform-at-santa-barbara-bowl-this-saturday/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65030\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/neil-young-to-perform-at-santa-barbara-bowl-this-saturday/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/neil-young-to-perform-at-santa-barbara-bowl-this-saturday/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/neil-young-to-perform-at-santa-barbara-bowl-this-saturday/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-05/neil-young-to-perform-at-santa-barbara-bowl-this-saturday/","id":6918,"author":{"id":706,"name":"Jack Wallace"},"related":[6917,6916,6915],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/706"}},"__N_SSG":true}
