That Monday marks the end of the last weekend in May and the federal holiday known as Memorial Day. In my past, this day away from school filled ice chests with innumerable six packs and lit the coal of round, Black &amp; Decker grills. After hot dogs smothered in mustard and relish and hamburgers on soft, too-sweet buns, we turned to bottle rockets and the bottom of that blue or red cooler. Memorial Day was my family’s way of welcoming summer like a preview to a movie.</p>\n<p>Yes, next Monday is Memorial Day, but last Monday, our little paradise was rocked by a painful reminder like a once-broken bone aching as a storm approaches, a scar reliving a long gone pain. A simple tweet with a number and the past participle “shot” seemed like a recurring nightmare that hit too close to home, and too close to May 23. As each passing day brings us closer to one year, it also brings us closer to another anniversary. Much of our country will emerge in droves from their normal lives, fresh with flip flops, ready for a carefree day at the beach or just at home with family and friends, but this Memorial Day weekend will be different for many of us.</p>\n<p>We will all face our own challenges as we mourn and celebrate in a span of three days, but perhaps we can find solace in the very traditions that seem so contradictory. At its heart, Memorial Day remembers Americans who have died in combat, and while we use the time away from “real life” to eat, drink and be merry, the holiday originates in loss. So this year, whether we venture to DP or to our parents’ back patios, we can take the time off to fondly remember those taken from our community.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>We at On The Menu stand by one belief: At the heart of every human unit (be it family, friendship or larger community), there is a place for food.

Cream the butter and sugars until fluffy. The sugar in the raw will prevent the mixture from being as smooth as granulated sugar. The large granules are okay.<br>\n2. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then Add the vanilla extract.<br>\n3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.<br>\nAlternately mix in the flour mixture and IPA in three additions, beginning and ending with flour.<br>\n4. Evenly fill mini cupcake papers about 3/4 full. Bake at 350°F for about 12-15 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. The tops of the cupcakes should be a light golden colour and will not be smooth.<br>\n5. To prepare the buttercream, cream the butter until smooth and then add the vanilla. Gradually add in the confectioners sugar. Add the IPA and mix until smooth and fluffy. Add more sugar or beer if needed.</p>\n<p><em>This recipe was originally published on the author’s blog.

Or at the very least, they ought to. The nationwide campaign promotes “eating real” and being conscious of the food we put into our bodies three times every day. With obesity remaining a prominent health issue that costs Americans upwards of $150 million annually, considering the food system and ingredients that contribute to our bulging bodies might be just what we need as a country. In addition to supporting “whole food” diets, which involve reducing processed sugars and other detrimental additives, this year’s annual event will hone in on the issues of food accessibility regardless of income level as well as justice for workers within the food production and farming industries.</p>\n<p>In the week leading up to Food Day, UCSB joined other University of California campuses and held a series of events related to food politics and healthy eating, beginning with a vegan picnic and the Gaucho Farmers Market. The final event, “Learn at Lunch” is a panel that will include talks from the UCSB Greenhouse and Garden Project and the A.S. Food Bank as well as two lectures on balancing our planet and food justice.</p>\n<p>At OTM, we could not let an event like this one slip away unnoticed like the peas we refused to eat as kids. We joined the national movement a little early to bring you stories and recipes to inspire eating real and eating right. I think we can agree that it’s about time we skipped the packaged junk and “it’s time for UCSB to eat real!” –Allison Wright, <em>On The Menu Editor</em></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Tofu Ceviche</h2>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">by Marisa Ratchford</h4>\n<p>It makes sense that in honor of National Food Day, UCSB would host a vegan potluck to celebrate. The potluck was held on Monday, Oct. 20, hence the meatless aspect of the festivity to correlate with the campus policy of Meatless Mondays.  The potluck was from 12-1 p.m. on the lawn between Cheadle Hall and Coral Tree Café. People were encouraged to bring their own vegan food — dishes without any meat, eggs, dairy, butter or even honey — and to enjoy the other recipes brought in by the attending guests.</p>\n<p>The potluck was blessed with a beautiful day: sunny clear skies and a light cool breeze to keep the sun’s rays from overheating the feast-goers or melting the mouth-watering vegan cupcakes they munched on. The community of veg-heads is a close-knit group who come from a variety of different backgrounds. With its participants’ variance in reasoning, knowledge and commitment, events such as the Vegan Potluck are enlightening for the partakers to learn other perspectives. The potluck was not just intended for the vegans, but also for the curious and adventurous people willing to learn about the meat-free culture and its benefits. As a vegetarian myself, not unfamiliar with the boredom of salads and veggie burgers, it was illuminating to find new and exciting recipes to try.</p>\n<p>Of course, I could not show up to the potluck empty handed. The meat-free diet can be challenging, but learning delicious new ways to flavor food with a complete lack of animal products is an experience I encourage. Vegan baked goods, usually replacing eggs with avocado or black beans, are just as moist and fluffy as any other delectable treat. How could a pasta be made without gooey mozzarella or parmesan? Well, with the help of properly cooked and seasoned vegetables, one would not even notice the lack of lactose on their plate. I brought tofu ceviche to the vegan meetup, a tasty and easy-to-make dish that anyone with a plastic knife and Tupperware can create.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_57240\" style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1986695949\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"57235\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-57240\" data-attachment-id=\"57240\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/three-recipes-to-try-on-national-food-day/photo-1-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?fit=614%2C409&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"614,409\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1336308127\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"41\",\"iso\":\"100\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"photo 1-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?fit=614%2C409&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-57240 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?resize=614%2C409\" alt=\"photo 1-1\" width=\"614\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?w=614&amp;ssl=1 614w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo-1-1.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-57240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Marissa Ratchford // Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Ingredients</p>\n<p>1 package of extra firm tofu<br>\n2 medium sized tomatoes<br>\n½ a red onion<br>\n½ a cucumber<br>\nCilantro<br>\nLemon<br>\nLime<br>\nSeasoned salt for taste</p>\n<h4>Preparation</h4>\n<p>Dice the tofu, tomatoes, onion and cucumber and mix in a bowl.

I take this break to indulge in my mother’s Asian cuisine thoughtfully prepared for the health-conscious individual. A favorite of mine is a nameless Chinese dish that consists of two primary ingredients: water spinach, also known as morning glory or swamp cabbage, and fermented soy beans. It’s easy enough for an elementary chef as well as healthy enough for those looking to get away from a heavy, starchy diet.</p>\n<p>Some advantages the water spinach offers include cholesterol reduction, constipation alleviation and even anti-aging benefits! It’s no wonder most Asians consistently appear ten years younger.</p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>450 g water spinach<br>\n2 tbsp olive oil<br>\n4 garlic cloves, diced<br>\n2 tbsp fermented soy beans (salted or sweetened; you pick!)<br>\n2 tsp sugar</p>\n<h4>Preparation</h4>\n<p>Wash the water spinach. Cut the spinach into 4 cm lengths, or you can easily snap them with your fingers (for those of you prohibited by residence hall policy to bring kitchen knives). Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a pan. Pour in the diced garlic and stir until light brown. Add handfuls of water spinach and fry for about a minute. Avoid overcooking to maintain the vegetable’s crunchy texture. Drop 2 tbsp fermented soy beans, then 2 tsp sugar. As the water spinach begins to shrink, turn off the heat. Serve on a plate, white rice optional.</p>\n<p>Even if healthy foods repulse you, this recipe still succeeds in delighting your taste buds by creating a dewy, nutty and softly crackling goodness. The dish will make you full, but never regretful; light, but never bloated. Rather than inducing the infamous food coma, this recipe will likely provoke a motivation to begin a healthier diet!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Moroccan Couscous with Vegetables</h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">by Lisa Maillard</h3>\n<p>A beneficial “whole food” craze is sweeping across America. Words like “vegan,”  “gluten free” and “organic” are being used to describe this fast-advancing culinary revolution. And yet, there seems to be the threat of restricted tastes when one conjures up images of a “vegan” or “gluten free” meal. What in the world tastes good without butter? And what do you mean pizza isn’t a vegetable? Thankfully for you, my health-conscious gastromaniacs, not everything “whole foods” has to taste healthy. Many global cultures have found ways to truly combine the terms delicious and nutritious. Today, we will be focusing on the Moroccan dish known as Couscous with Vegetables. Couscous is almost like what pasta and quinoa’s baby would be if that were a thing, i.e., yummy. And as this recipe proves, vegetables can be fun, too.</p>\n<p>For a little background, I grew up in a family of French people. I am French. My parents are French. My grandparents are French and most of my great-grandparents are French. Unfortunately, France has a long history of colonization in places where they are not welcome, such as Morocco. However, some good did come out of this — at least for the French — and we absorbed some Moroccan culture before we were rightfully kicked out. Couscous is one of my favorite home-cooked meals.</p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>For the Vegetables: 1 can of chickpeas (my mother would like me to stress the importance of the chickpeas), 1/3 cup oil, 1 onion, finely chopped, 1 eggplant for the eggplant lover, 1/2 for the eggplant liker, diced, 3 medium-sized carrots, sliced, 2 potatoes, diced, 1 yellow squash, diced, a pinch of quatre-épices (cloves, nutmeg, ground pepper and ginger), 3 teaspoons harissa sauce*, 2 cups boiling water, 3 oz. green beans, cut 2 inches in length, 2 zucchini, sliced, 1 tomato, cut in eighths, one tiny pinch of cinnamon</p>\n<p>For the Couscous:<br>\n1 cup couscous, 3/4 cup boiling water, 2 teaspoons butter, or vegetable oil if you want to go vegan</p>\n<h4>Preparation</h4>\n<p>For the vegetables:<br>\nHeat oil in a large pot. Cook onion on low for 10 minutes. Add eggplant, carrots and potatoes. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Add squash, quatre-épices and harissa sauce and then green beans and zucchini. Add tomato and chickpeas last. Add the 2 cups of boiling water, cover and let stew for another 20-30 minutes. End with the tiny pinch of cinnamon.</p>\n<p>For the couscous:<br>\nPour boiling water on couscous in a deep dish. Add butter (or oil for a vegan option) and let sit for 10 minutes covered.<br>\nServe with vegetables.</p>\n<p>*Harissa sauce is a pepper-based concoction popular in Northern African cuisines. It often combines other flavors such as cumin, garlic, coriander and even lemon juice. For all the spicy-food-lovers out there who don’t have a jar of harissa, add Tabasco sauce to the vegetables after serving. Dose at your own peril.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story originally appeared on page 21 of October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Expensive taste, as in dropping $85 for a five course fixed menu consisting solely of tapas, world travel for the sole purpose of dining at a restaurant rewarded with three Michelin stars, or foie gras, (if you don’t know what it is, you probably can’t afford it). It also proves to be a serious detriment to the lightly lined wallets of broke foodies on college campuses everywhere. We, as consumers of quality food, when on hiatus from the ramen diet, set this standard for expensive taste. Basic economic principles explain that the higher the quality, the higher the price. People are willing to pay more for the tastes and amenities of fine dining; conversely, no one balks at the low quality beef in McDonalds hamburgers. In essence, you get what you pay for. Or do you?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The first weekend of October marked the 27th annual California Avocado Festival toting the motto, “Peace, love, and guacamole.” Sounds good to me. Avo experts and guac enthusiasts alike flocked to Carpinteria to take part in the celebration of the fatty fruits. In addition to a world of avocado inspired goods, (live avo truffles, avo cupcakes, and even avo lotion), the thoroughfare hosted four separate stages with a constant stream of live music and thousands of meandering souls in search of free samples. If one nudged their way to the front of one of the farmer’s market-esque booths, spoons scooped giant mouthfuls straight from freshly halved avocados. If able to remain in this prime freebie zone, one could even try to discern the differences in different strains of avocados. For those that are curious, avoid MacArthur avocados. Their oily flesh and acrid sweetness may surprise eaters more accustomed to creamier Hass avocados found in the standard grocery store.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p> </p>\n<p>But this gets us back to the idea of expensive taste. While at the Avo Fest, I purchased one relatively massive Lamb Hass avocado for $2.50. This behemoth was a good six inches in length. At a fixed price of two bucks fifty for a single avocado, I was definitely leaving with the largest fruit I could scrounge up. After a little gentle rummaging and some disdainful stares, I found the my giant avocado and began planning how best to deliciously demolish it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On the long trek back to the parking lot, I encountered another similarly gigantic freak of nature. Cradled in the arms of a fellow avocado enthusiast was what turned out to be a $50 avocado. Only slightly more impressive than the one pleasantly swinging from the bag around my wrist, this avocado was twenty times more expensive. What made this avo better? After sampling the Lamb Hass, I didn’t think I’d find a more exemplary specimen. Could this smooth, green skinned, precious gem of a fruit really outweigh my pebbly skinned bargain box special? As it would turn out, this guy paid so much because he was willing to pay the most for it. When the bidding ended, he was the lucky dope to part with one Grant and walk away with the prized avocado.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This poor fellow wasn’t the only one duped into paying too much for food. Festival food vendors notoriously overcharge for their goods and the Avo Fest was no different. Smoothies sold for seven dollars and sandwiches for close to ten. I was ecstatic to find tacos under five. This relatively inexpensive buy proved to be the most satisfying of the day. Loaded with pastor, onions, cilantro, spicy salsa, and a heaping portion of guacamole, this was no ordinary plate of tacos. Despite being deceptively simple, the delight that accompanies a ton of mashed avocados and a sinfully greasy meal was overwhelming. Enjoying such a masterful assemblage of ingredients was more than just a need to fill the stomach–it was sheer pleasure. This was inexpensive, basic, and delicious eating.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is where we get back to the secret. Good food does not have to break the bank. Good food doesn’t even need to be complex, (though sometimes complex flavours are an indulgent treat). When you give no care to the grease dripping down your chin and can not fathom taking the last bite of a guac smothered, uber satisfying taco, that you realize the ridiculous nature of a Michelin star. There’s a certain thrill in the mixture of smoky, meat-grilling smells mingling with the sweet scent of frying funnel cakes. With olfactory overload and the subliminal hum of multiple jam bands at close proximity, getting lost in the form of the taco seems pretty wonderful. This is a “special journey” in itself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>To celebrate the recent Avo Fest and the pure goodness of simple food, here’s a recipe inspired by the best taco I’ve eaten in my life. This soup takes five minutes of prep, a blender, and a little love. It’s kind of like eating spoonfuls of guacamole without the inherent shame of eating spoonfuls of guacamole.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56529\" style=\"width: 634px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1048476694\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"52503\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56529\" data-attachment-id=\"56529\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-16/peace-love-and-simplicity/avo-soup-2013/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?fit=624%2C423&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"624,423\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"avo soup 2013\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?fit=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?fit=624%2C423&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56529 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?resize=624%2C423\" alt=\"Bacon bits, pan fried tortilla strips and a dash of pepper spice up this simple soup.\" width=\"624\" height=\"423\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?w=624&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avo-soup-2013.png?resize=250%2C169&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56529\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bacon bits, pan fried tortilla strips and a dash of pepper spice up this simple soup.</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In a blender, combine two large avocados, (or three small), half a peeled cucumber, a small red onion, one cup of scalded cream or half &amp; half*, juice of a lime, one cup of water, and cilantro, salt, and pepper to taste.
