Customers pay a deposit to use a reusable cup, which is repaid when the cup is returned.</p>\n<p>“We have an exchange program, so it is $5 for a hot cup and $2 for a Mason jar, and you pay that deposit and you get your order in a reusable cup,” Yamasaki said. “If you give it back to us, we give you [the deposit] back.”</p>\n<p>In contrast to the I.V. location, the downtown location will be a Prohibition-era themed bar beginning at 5 p.m. The bar, called Lab Social, is a speakeasy-style bar, meaning that it is hidden from public view.</p>\n<p>“[The bar] is supposed to be slightly incognito,” Yamasaki said. “It is a trend that a lot of bigger cities are doing, where instead of just being a bar with the front door open, it’s a bar that is kind of hidden within another store or hidden from plain sight.”</p>\n<p>The front door will be locked at nights, and customers will have to find their way into the bar through the back entrance, according to Yamasaki.</p>\n<p>Other differences between the I.V. location and the new Cajé downtown revolve around the menu.</p>\n<p>“In Isla Vista, we have bagels, acai bowls and smoothies,” Yamasaki said. “[Downtown], our menu right now is consisting of a tortilla española and an avocado toast, which is different than the location in Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the downtown Cajé has formed a collaboration with Sama Sama Kitchen, an Asian fusion restaurant, to diversify Cajé’s menu. According to Yamasaki, the menu is expected to grow, with the full version to be rolled out come grand opening, pending a time and date to be determined.</p>\n<p>“The space is beautiful, and we are really excited to provide a downtown haven for our regulars in Cajé Isla Vista as well,” Yamasaki said.</p>\n<p>“We appreciate all the love and support we have received so far. It’s actually been ridiculous how many regulars from our current location came out to show some love and some support. There is just a lot of gratitude here for that loyalty.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-86155\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hundreds of baby birds are expected to hatch across the UCSB campus. <em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Garvais graduated as a music major from UCSB in 2018 and has since worked to help local animals in need.</p>\n<p>“Right around now, early March is when we start getting hundreds of baby birds. Usually, it’s about 200 baby animals in our care at a time. That can also be baby mammals like bunnies and squirrels and raccoons,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Garvais explained that March 1 is the unofficial beginning of baby bird season, when birds including mockingbirds, towheess, sparrows, finches, crows and seagulls begin to hatch from their nests.</p>\n<p>She also emphasized the difference between birds in the hatchling, nestling and fledgling stages of development, as they should each be treated in a different way.</p>\n<p>“Hatchlings are straight out of the egg, within the past couple days. Nestlings have a couple of feathers, but are still mostly naked and are around a week old. Fledglings are fully feathered, and they are almost ready to fly,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>If found on the ground, hatchlings and nestlings should be returned to their nest if possible. However, it is normal for fledglings leave the nest as they mature.</p>\n<p>“They do spend some time on the ground for a little while once they are fully feathered, hopping around and learning how to fly. That’s normal. Their muscles are still developing for a couple of weeks,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>“We are trying to instruct people not to kidnap animals that don’t need to be saved. The best way for any baby to grow up is with their parents, so if you see a baby the first instinct shouldn’t be ‘I need to get this out immediately,’ it should be ‘I need to call for help.’ ”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Baby birds are hatching all over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCSB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UCSB</a>!

As soon as they are snagged, they just break off so the cat can’t get injured,” Garvais said. According to Garvais, cats are the top danger to birds in the area, injuring over 200 birds in the Santa Barbara area each year.</p>\n<p>If a bird seems injured or orphaned, or if the nestling’s nest cannot be found, Garvais encourages students to contact SBWCN’s rescue hotline at (805) 681-1080.</p>\n<p>Once under the care of SBWCN, the rescued animals will receive attentive support until they are ready to be released back into the wild.</p>\n<p>“For hummingbirds, we feed them special nectar that we get from Denmark. It’s specifically the best hummingbird nectar that you can get,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Songbirds are fed a mixture of mealworms, yogurt and vitamins that are blended together like a smoothie. They are fed by volunteers every 20 to 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Garvais hopes to debunk common misconceptions students may have about treating injured birds.</p>\n<p>“There are all these myths associated with baby birds that if you touch one then its parents won’t be able to recognize it anymore. That is totally false. We don’t recommend that people touch the animals more than they need to be, but in order to renest a baby bird, it can be put back,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Garvais herself first learned about SBWCN when her friends brought an injured duck into her dorm room while she was living in San Miguel Hall. After a quick Google search, she discovered SBWCN and decided to take the duck over.</p>\n<p>“I actually got an Uber and brought the bird to them. It was really cool to know that this resource exists,” Garvais said.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Garvais feels that many UCSB and Isla Vista residents don’t know about SBWCN, especially due to the constantly changing population of college students. Garvais hopes to raise awareness so that more animals are able to receive the help they need.</p>\n<p>“Just like [how] people save the CSO number in their phones, we are hoping that people can save our helpline, because you never know when you are going to find an animal in need,” Garvais said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

We are already looking into expansion… We are actually looking at a Hollywood shop, so we are in the works of getting that set up,” Gabriel English, general manager of Mojo, said.</p>\n<p>According to English, the Hollywood expansion would be in collaboration with Mojo’s business partners, who would also like to start another store in Oxnard.</p>\n<p>Mojo’s success can be partly attributed to the variety of Asian food and drink on the menu. Aside from the typical drinks that one would expect at a boba shop, Mojo also entices customers by offering an ever-changing assortment of Asian fusion snacks, including popcorn chicken, spicy Korean wings and kimchi fries.</p>\n<p>“The latest thing we are thinking about adding to the snacks section is fried cheese wontons. It’s a personal recipe of mine, and has a lot of vegetables and cheese inside it,” English said.</p>\n<p>Customers are attracted to the store by the welcoming environment, as well as the employees’ upbeat nature and passion about boba.</p>\n<p>One such employee is Jeene Yim, a second-year art and biology double major who works as a tea specialist at Mojo. Yim began working at Mojo when it opened last summer, and feels that it makes up for the lack of quality Asian food in I.V.</p>\n<p>“I am passionate about boba and I am passionate about my culture,” Yim said. “I wanted to see more Asian culture in I.V.. We do have a lot of Asian food places in I.V., but I really didn’t feel it was good… I really liked boba, and this is the reason I was really excited to start working here.”</p>\n<p>Five months later, Yim has found a sense of community within the walls of the Mojo kitchen, a community that she feels shines through to customers everyday.</p>\n<p>“We have a desire to bring good boba to I.V. so we are always trying to improve ourselves and bring out the best drinks. The close knit community in the back between our workers shows through, and that’s what makes us different.”</p>\n<p>To Yim and countless other UCSB students, Mojo has become a reliable destination for high quality boba.</p>\n<p>“Everytime I’m walking on campus, I hear someone say ‘I want boba, do you want to go to Mojo?’ and I feel like before that, there wasn’t really a certain spot that they would say. When I hear that it makes me happy. I am so proud to work here,” Yim said.</p>\n<p>Mojo Teahouse is located at 6578 Trigo Road.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the Feb. 20, 2019 issue of the Daily Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

She hopes to use her experience to host events like these and make students aware of the resources available to them on campus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caughman echoed a similar goal for the event. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We knew we wanted to do something to reduce food waste,” Caughman said. “Through our research, we found that a leading cause of food waste stems from the food in circulation not being distributed efficiently, so we decided to survey UCSB students to see how much they knew about the A.S. Food Bank.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The survey results showed that many people were unaware of the A.S. Food Bank (A.S. FB)  or found it to be inaccessible to them. This gave the team the idea to bring the A.S. Food Bank to the people, in one of the most heavily trafficked parts of campus during one of the busiest times of the day, according to Caughman.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was deemed a success by the team, with 53 students receiving free groceries from the pop-up event in the one hour they were open.

CSD, pictured above, released a statement on Monday condemning the proposed Title IX changes. <em>Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The amendments, proposed by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, would narrow the definition of sexual harassment as well as limit the proceedings to live hearings, among other changes.</p>\n<p>The amendments would also allow educational institutions to dismiss cases of sexual and domestic violence that do not occur on campus premises, according to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/httpspence/status/1084870878024818689\">statement</a> issued by Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) President Spencer Brandt.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD is “greatly concerned” about this proposed change due to the large number of students that live off-campus — I.V. alone is home to approximately 14,000 UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students, according to the statement.</p>\n<p>The statement also referenced statistics from the 2017-2018 school year, which stated that 376 students approached UCSB’s Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (C.A.R.E) office to disclose that they had experienced “sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, and/or had been stalked, either on or off campus, recently or in the past.”</p>\n<p>“The new standard will leave the door open for legal challenges that could encourage higher education institutions to look the other way when sexual and interpersonal violence occurs off campus,” the letter said.</p>\n<p>The I.V. CSD also said fear and pressure can leave many students unwilling to file a report.</p>\n<p>“Reporting to Title IX will become much more difficult, and some cases [may] be ignored completely,” I.V. CSD Board President Spencer Brandt said in a statement to the Nexus.</p>\n<p>With these new amendments, the I.V. CSD said it believes that even more cases could be left unreported, and students committing sexual and domestic assault could do so without facing disciplinary action from school administration.</p>\n<p>Brandt went on to highlight the ways that support groups on campus have worked to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing survivors of harassment and assault.</p>\n<p>“Survivor advocacy and support groups and political organizers, such as Students Against Sexual Assault, are doing excellent work bringing the lived experiences of survivors out of the shadows and into the light. Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration should be working with groups like them to reform Title IX policies, instead of right-wing special interest groups,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p>The University of California reflected <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-12-03/uc-responds-to-proposed-title-ix-amendments/\">similar sentiments</a> regarding the proposed amendments, according to a press release sent out by Suzanne Taylor, the UC’s interim systemwide Title IX coordinator.</p>\n<p>Taylor expressed concern that changes to Title IX would create “new and unnecessary hurdles” for survivors and hinder the university administration’s ability to properly enforce Title IX.</p>\n<p>Title IX is a federal civil rights law enacted in 1972 that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally-funded educational institutions. These regulations require administrators to take action in response to reported cases of sexual and domestic violence.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education encourages students, educators and community members to share their responses to the proposed amendments by Jan. 28.</p>\n<p><em>Amira Garewal and Sean Crommelin are reporters for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Food Co-op, the Transfer Student Center and Associated Students Food Bank.</p>\n<p>“We love working with our campus and community partners because they all bring their unique ideas, strengths and expertise to the table,” she said in an email.</p>\n<p>In Fall Quarter 2018, over 530 students attended FNBS events, Ovalle said.</p>\n<p>“Every quarter we put on approximately two workshops per week,” Ovalle said. “[These workshops] help improve food security on campus through education but more specifically through helping promote healthy food, easy access, educational content to increase food security and teaching skills.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the new hands-on cooking classes, FNBS will continue to offer a variety of nutrition and wellness-related programs, including garden and grocery tours as well as cooking demonstrations.</p>\n<p>Garden tours teach students how to plant seeds to grow their own vegetables and herbs. Similarly, FNBS hosts tours of the I.V.

Act – signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016 and implemented Jan. 2017 – requires local law enforcement to inform undocumented immigrants of requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) to speak with them.</p>\n<p>Sheriff Brown emphasized during the forum that the prison release dates were public in accordance with state law and are accessible to members of the public, and I.C.E., only if the resident’s name is known.</p>\n<p>He also said that the release dates were public so that residents would be able to know when someone who had committed a crime against them would be out of jail.</p>\n<p>Brown reported that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) released 15,241 inmates in the 2017 calendar year, and I.C.E. requested to be notified of the release dates of 526 of those inmates.</p>\n<p>I.C.E. then picked up 351 of those inmates.</p>\n<p>In Oct. 2017, Governor Brown passed <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/governor-brown-signs-sanctuary-state-bill-limits-police-cooperation-with-immigration-officials/\">Senate Bill 54</a>, which restricted the authority of I.C.E. in regards to local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“[SB 54] curtails the use of state or local resources from engaging in immigration enforcement, effective in 2018, subject to a number of exemptions,” Sheriff Brown said during Tuesday’s forum.</p>\n<p>Between Jan. 1, 2018, and Nov. 30, 2018, SBSO released 11,551 inmates. I.C.E. requested to be notified of the release of 390 of those inmates and then picked up 74 of those.</p>\n<p>SB 54’s passage led immigration officials to spend more time out in the streets, Brown said.</p>\n<p>“Instead of relying primarily on taking inmates from the county jail, they now have started to conduct field operations,” Brown said.</p>\n<p>“[I.C.E.] may be after someone who is a criminal offender, but if that person has other people with them, [and] they determine that those people are undocumented aliens, then oftentimes they will [arrest them as well].”</p>\n<p>Brown noted that this has only created more fear within Santa Barbara County.</p>\n<p>“Most immigrants who are in our county, be they documented or undocumented, are good, hardworking people who are otherwise law-abiding. But it’s naive to think that every one of them is like that,” Brown said during the forum.</p>\n<p>“The reality has shown that we have had some very significant crimes committed in our community by people who are illegal aliens. There should be a common desire for everyone to see that people who commit such crimes are members of gangs or who are predisposed to violence for a serious crime, to be removed from our community.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_85330\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85330\" data-attachment-id=\"85330\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/sbc-residents-demand-police-end-cooperation-with-i-c-e-during-annual-t-r-u-t-h-act-forum/img_4008/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_4008\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85330\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4008.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-85330\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Several Santa Barbara County residents showed up to the forum to protest SBSO’s cooperation with I.C.E. <em>Sanya Kamidi / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Numerous residents from Santa Barbara County spoke out against the actions of the local law enforcement during the public forum, demanding an end to the provision of prison release dates to I.C.E.</p>\n<p>Present among the speakers was Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) Interim General Manager Jonathan Abboud, who, along with several I.V. and Associated Students officials, presented a petition calling on the sheriff and the County Board of Supervisors to “cease and desist the publication of release dates of all people within the Sheriff’s custody.”</p>\n<p>This sentiment was echoed by the 19 speakers who followed, including representatives from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice and the League of United Latin American Citizens.</p>\n<p>Some of those representatives shared personal anecdotes of family members being taken away by immigration enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p>“I think most of us can agree that the federal government has failed to create a workable immigration process,” Gina Whitaker, an Allies for Immigration representative, said. “There is no line to get into for millions of people who face increasing persecution. The reasons that people are here undocumented are varied and complex and often beyond their control.</p>\n<p>“We need to consider the individual circumstances of each person’s life and recognize the humanity of all people.”</p>\n<p>Joana Barrera, a representative for Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy (C.A.U.S.E.), shared a personal story of her family being separated after police cooperation with I.C.E.</p>\n<p>She explained that her brother had finished his community service when he had been picked up by I.C.E.</p>\n<p>“Luckily he knew his rights and we were able to find him and pick him up from a local shopping center,” she said. “But that really speaks amounts about the lack of trust between the government and residents.”</p>\n<p>“If a person who happens to be an immigrant commits harm, they need to be held accountable like anyone else. But the actions of a few people should not be used to scapegoat whole communities.”</p>\n<p><em>Sanya Kamidi contributed reporting.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-46071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SBMTD buses serve the UCSB and I.V. communities within the greater Santa Barbara County.  <em>Nexus file photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) plans to reach this goal by developing an eco-friendly fleet of zero-emissions buses powered by renewable energy, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>The district hopes this move will reflect its efforts to support climate change solutions.</p>\n<p>SBMTD has a history of leading the way in environmentally-friendly transportation, said Hillary Blackerby, SBMTD interim planning and marketing manager, in an interview with the Nexus.</p>\n<p>SBMTD implemented the first electric buses in the U.S. into its fleet in 1991. Today, they have the second largest number of active electric buses out of any transit system in California, the press release stated.</p>\n<p>“We are committed to making this happen,” Jerry Estrada, SBMTD general manager, said in the press release.</p>\n<p>“The whole team at Santa Barbara MTD is proud of our pioneering work in battery-electric transit, and we look forward to continuing to lead the industry towards a zero-emissions future.”</p>\n<p>The cost of this transition is unknown, as bus prices tend to fluctuate significantly with the market, Blackerby said.</p>\n<p>SBMTD recently purchased 14 new 30-foot electric buses, costing $380,000 per bus, she said. The 30-foot buses are used for shuttle service in Santa Barbara; however, for downtown, waterfront and crosstown shuttle, Blackerby projects they would need 40 to 60-foot buses.</p>\n<p>The latter would likely have steeper costs.</p>\n<p>The zero-emissions project will be financed by a combination of funding from the Federal Transit Association, state funding and other grants, Blackerby said. The transition to zero-emission buses will take place as the current buses reach the end of their useful life.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the California Air Resources Board – an organization dedicated to maintaining healthy air quality – is expected to adopt new statewide clean air standards in 2019 which would gradually phase in requirements for public transit agencies to purchase only zero-emission buses over the next few decades.</p>\n<p>These expectations will be met by SBMTD before the new standard is implemented, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>“By setting this goal, MTD can plan this transition, build the necessary charging infrastructure, send a market signal to bus manufacturers, and set Santa Barbara on the path to 100% clean, quiet electric buses powered by 100% renewable energy,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>The transition to zero-emission buses was also due in part to community organizations, including the Community Environmental Council and the local chapter of the Sierra Club. The groups worked to garner support for the plan from other community groups and individuals, according to Blackerby.</p>\n<p>SBMTD Board Chair Dave Davis said fulfilling the transition will be challenging, but feasible with help from local partners and the transit industry.</p>\n<p>“The MTD Board of Directors knows that it is the right thing to do for our agency, our community, and our planet,” he said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

response to a lot of questions that people had [regarding the union strikes],” Isabella Liu, vice director and head of publicity USAS, said.</p>\n<p>“We just wanted to educate people and give them a space to communicate and open up dialogue where dialogue hasn’t been opened.”</p>\n<p>In October, several hundred UC workers went on their <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-10-23/afscme-begins-second-strike-of-the-year/\">second strike of the year</a>. The workers, represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), protested low wages and job outsourcing, among other issues.</p>\n<p>AFSCME is the the largest union of UC employees in California.</p>\n<p>Juan Donato, a lead groundskeeper who has worked at UCSB for 35 years, spoke during the panel about the strikes and working at UCSB.</p>\n<p>He said he found the AFSCME union to be a channel through which his voice could be heard.</p>\n<p>“Fortunately, UCSB is a public school, so we get to ask questions,” Donato said. “Unfortunately, when I ask questions myself, it doesn’t work. I get muted. But together with the union, we are strong. With the union, I have a voice.”</p>\n<p>Anna Fabian, a fourth-year AFSCME intern, spoke of learning about the labor movement as she went through her four years at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“Coming to UCSB, I didn’t know much about the labor movement and I didn’t know about the hypocrisy that happens here,” Fabian said. “We learn so much in our classes about the mistreatment of workers, but it’s happening right outside our classrooms.”</p>\n<p>“After you learn so much about what is happening, you can’t just turn around and not do anything about it.”</p>\n<p>One-fifth of UC workers have faced discrimination in the workplace based on their cultural background, one-third reported not being paid overtime and one-half reported being overworked, according to a survey conducted by USAS.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the majority of workers reported not being paid a living wage.</p>\n<p>AFSCME members said during the panel they will continue to push for change, despite the fact that no changes came out of the October strikes.</p>\n<p>“We may not be able to see the results in our time, but it’s the legacy that I want to leave,” Donato said.</p>\n<p>“For my children, for the children of my grandchildren — in the long term, it is going to be worth it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

Rides can cost anywhere from $3 to $6.</p>\n<p>“We thought that same concept could be applied to food security, so we decided to lay out this idea where we create a page for grocery rideshares in the same format,” he said.</p>\n<p>CalFresh coordinator and fourth-year psychology major Stephanie Perez also provided pivotal direction in the implementation of the program.</p>\n<p>“When I applied for CalFresh, I got approved for the program … but there was another barrier that was stopping me from getting groceries: transportation,” she said.</p>\n<p>“This is something that we really need on campus – transportation for students that really need to go to the grocery store.”</p>\n<p>Despite several programs on campus that address food insecurity – such as the Associated Students Food Bank – transportation still remains a barrier for many students, Etaat said.</p>\n<p>“Getting to places like Costco, Albertsons and Trader Joe’s can be difficult if you don’t have a car,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Nadia Abushanab, a CalFresh advocate and third-year environmental studies major, the idea for the grocery rideshare was sparked during the Food Security Retreat at Hastings Nature Reserve that took place in September.</p>\n<p>“In [the retreat] we broke out into groups talking about different problems with food security that we want to address,” Abushanab said.</p>\n<p>Melanie Leung, a second-year environmental studies major, used the grocery rideshare group to carpool with three others to Sprouts and Trader Joe’s soon after the page was created.</p>\n<p>“I’ve only done it once, but so far it’s been a good experience,” Leung said. “I think it’s a great idea because I find it a waste of gas when I go get groceries alone and feel a little less guilty if I’m bringing others that need to go as well.”</p>\n<p>Perez had similar feedback about her experience with the rideshare group.</p>\n<p>“I can pay $5 for roundtrip, rather than paying Lyft $10 for one way and $10 for the other way,” she said. “As of now, the rideshare group has been effective for me and I’m glad we got it started.”</p>\n<p>Perez says there is potential in the future for the rideshare group to transform into a school-affiliated carpool system.</p>\n<p>“We hope there will be enough data from the rideshare group to show that there is a huge number of students who need rides and that transportation is stopping them [from] getting the proper nutrition that they need,” Perez said.</p>\n<p>“Eventually we want it to transform into something bigger where the school provides transportation for students to take them to the grocery stores.”</p>\n<p>Until then, the group hopes to increase its membership to benefit more of the UCSB community. The group currently has over 400 members.</p>\n<p>“We are hoping to pick up momentum and hopefully the message will spread and people will want to engage,” Etaat said.</p>\n<p>“This is a mutually beneficial situation. We are very new, but we are hoping to expand a lot.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

electrical equipment was associated with an ignition near Koenigstein Road in Santa Paula — one of at least two origin points for the Thomas Fire,” Southern California Edison (SCE) said in press release sent out on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>However, the statement noted that there were other factors that contributed to the Thomas Fire, including dry vegetation, high temperatures and strong winds.</p>\n<p>“Wildfire risk is increasing at the same time as more and more residential and commercial development is occurring in some of the highest-risk areas — with over a quarter of SCE’s service territory in high fire risk areas identified on the CPUC’s (California Public Utilities Commision) fire risk maps,” the press release stated.</p>\n<p>SCE is now awaiting permission from the California Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) to further their investigation into the causes of the Thomas Fire.</p>\n<p>According to the press release, CAL FIRE has removed equipment located near Koenigstein Road, so SCE has not yet been able to inspect it. “SCE will not be able to determine the specific cause of the Koenigstein Road ignition until it can analyze the equipment currently in CAL FIRE’s possession.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, SCE is conducting an ongoing study regarding the causes of the Thomas Fire. This study takes an in-depth look into possible ignition points and fire progression from each point, among other factors.</p>\n<p>SCE is one of the largest electric utility companies in the U.S., serving about 15 million customers in Southern California, according to the press release.</p>\n<p>The Thomas Fire devastated the Santa Barbara area last December, burning over 281,893 acres of land. It was the largest fire in California history at the time, until it was surpassed by the Mendocino Complex Fire in July 2018.</p>\n<p>During the fire, UC Santa Barbara <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-05/uc-santa-barbara-gym-will-accept-nearly-200-evacuees-from-thomas-fire/\">opened</a> its recreation center to evacuees from the Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s Associated Students Senate also <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-15/a-s-senate-allocates-5000-to-help-students-head-home-during-thomas-fire/\">allocated</a> over $2,000 to students who needed to return home because of the fire. UCSB Chancellor Henry Yang later <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-12-10/breaking-ucsb-cancels-finals-week-postpones-fall-quarter-due-to-thomas-fire/\">cancelled finals week</a> for Fall Quarter 2018 due to the unsafe conditions on campus.</p>\n<p>The fire burned the soil, preventing it from being able to absorb the heavy rainfall that followed, thus leading to the Montecito mudslides which <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/\">killed</a> over 20 people in January and forced thousands to evacuate.</p>\n<p>The findings come as SCE faces multiple charges relating to the Thomas Fire, including from attorneys representing local residents and the City of Ventura.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3801b91cd89a8ee0409145f1cfba00dc?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/amira-garewal/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Amira Garewal</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Amira Garewal is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.
