The seller made 10 copies of the exact same ticket and sold it to 10 different people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So every day, for the next three days of the festival, it was a race to be the first in line. Only the first ticket would show up as valid, and the other nine would be invalid,” Martitsch said. “So needless to say, this was a terrible experience for me.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta Leaf Labs, a team developing THC- free marijuana, won the second place prize of $7,500 and the $5,000 Elings award for a total of $12,500 — walking away with the most cash prizes. California recently passed Proposition 64, legalizing marijuana, which leaves them with no close competition anywhere in the state.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanderlease, a website designed to make subleasing easier, won $5,000 dollars for third place. The six team members are all part of Alpha Kappa Psi, a co-ed professional business fraternity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shikha Sharma, a fourth-year political science major, said he thought of the idea for the website after having a difficult time finding housing while interning in New York. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The people’s choice award went to Collatera, a startup that has created a bandage-type patch which could be applied on diabetic foot ulcers. It heals foot ulcers up to four times faster than similar patches currently on the market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team won $5,000 as well as a honorary award of $2,500. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has completed trial studies on mice and will start live clinical trials at Harvard University and Tufts Medical Center this summer. Two members of the team will be moving to the East Coast after they graduate in June. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OrganicMatters received the second honorary award. The team members seek to partner with poultry farmers and collect bird waste to make into fertilizer, which helps the environment by disposing of byproduct in a profitable manner. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PhantaField won the third honorary award, and its members are currently developing augmented reality glasses. After the competition, their goal is to make their product into a reality and acquire funding.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“With our expertise and my 15 years of semiconductor experience, we think we can solve these problems, but it’s uncovering the next problems that we don’t know about yet that are the real challenges coming up,” Dylan Rodriguez, a graduate student in the technology management program, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Team PhantaField said their mentor, Alexander Fang, former UCSB student and former owner of local company Aurrion, has helped them by sharing his own experiences developing Aurrion at UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through Aurrion, Fang developed nanofabrications. While he sold the company to Juniper Networks, a technology company based in Sunnyvale, the company is still focused on nanofabrications.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rodriguez said since Fang sold the company, he has more time on his hands to give back to his alma mater by helping aspiring entrepreneurs through events like New Venture.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“His expertise has been immeasurable. It’s just been great having him as an advisor,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Master of Technology Management is the main focus of the Technology Management Program. Graduate students in the program must partake in an intensive nine-month program that aims to produce future tech industry leaders and provide them with mentors and advisors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dave Adornetto, Entrepreneurship Program Director at the Technology Management Program, said the courses offered throughout the year help participants prepare for the competition and play a major role in the competitor’s final projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of the finalists, Vince Kuppamala of Collatera and Dylan Rodriguez of PhantaField, are graduate students getting their Master’s degree through this program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kuppamala said the professors in the program are from the top business schools in the U.S., providing the eager students with experienced mentors to learn from.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t think there’s another program like it in the country,” Kuppamala said. “You can get such a great integrated business and technology education.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78153\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78153\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-27/scam-free-ticketing-platform-wins-new-venture-competition/","id":2378,"author":{"id":105,"name":"Jack Hu"},"related":[2377,2376,2375],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Startup Competition Finalists to Square Off on Wednesday","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Venture-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Venture-1.jpg?resize=600%2C450&ssl=1","description":"After a year of preparation and competition, six student-run startup companies will move on to the finals of the New Venture Competition.

In the past, winners have been awarded cash prizes ranging from $7,500 to $15,000. This year, the six teams will be competing for a pot of $40,000 in prize money. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The teams this year are Collatera, CRYPTIX, Delta Leaf Labs, OrganicMatters, Phanta Field and Wanderlease, each coming off a hard-fought semifinal round held on May 3. Twenty teams participated in the fair, and the best six were chosen to move on to this final round.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The finalists were decided by the public who attended the fair, but the winner on Wednesday will be determined by a panel of judges. Here are the six teams competing for the final prize:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collatera, which proposes a better method for diabetes detection and prevention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRYPTIX, which is creating a ticket search engine to eliminate inflated ticket prices and fraud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delta Leaf Labs, which aims to mass-produce non-addictive marijuana for medical purposes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OrganicMatters, which looks to partner with the poultry industry and turn their waste products into fertilizer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phanta Field, which is trying to create augmented reality glasses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanderlease, which is making an app that aspires to make subleasing easier. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, OSMO won the competition. The four-person team designed a portable water sampling instrument to make it easier for scientists to collect water samples.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They received the first-place prize of $12,000, but all the teams that made it to the finals walked away from the event with cash prizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprisingly, the second-place team walked away with the most amount of money, having additionally been awarded the People’s Choice Award and the Citrix Impact Award. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dave Adornetto, entrepreneurship director for TMP, said there were no major changes this year in terms of format, but there were more people who signed up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s participants have been preparing since the competition started back in November with 38 teams.

Senate plans to pass a resolution next Wednesday to allocate university spots and academic scholarships to the Syrian refugees displaced from their home universities.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Associated Students (A.S.) Senate plans to pass a resolution next Wednesday to allocate university spots and academic scholarships to the Syrian refugees displaced from their home universities.</p>\n<p>Senators Bianca Fernandez and Batsheva Stoll authored the resolution and presented it at the meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 18. The resolution is part of a UC-wide movement to join the Institute for International Education (IIE) Syrian Consortium for Higher Education in Crisis.</p>\n<p>So far, participating universities have collected 17,635 signatures in support of scholarships for Syrian students.</p>\n<p>The IIE Syrian Consortium is a group of international universities that have allocated admission space for Syrian students and provided them with scholarships to help them attend school while their own country remains unsafe in an ongoing war.</p>\n<p>Funded by the Clinton Foundation, the United Nations and other global organizations, the goal of the scholarship program is to help Syrian students continue their education and rebuild their country.</p>\n<p>The program also offers scholarships, leadership training and conducts research on how to improve global higher education.</p>\n<p>When refugees are forced to escape their country, the students must temporarily abandon their education. The IIC Syrian Consortium plans for these Syrian students to attend college in other countries and then return home to become leaders.</p>\n<p>If the resolution passes, UCSB would be the fourth school in the UC system to officially petition the Regents to join the IIE Syrian Consortium, alongside UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Berkeley. Of the three, UC Davis is the only school that has already enrolled Syrian refugee students.</p>\n<p>The resolution was brought to the Senate’s attention by “Books Not Bombs,” a campaign founded in response to the Syrian refugee crisis. The goal of “Books Not Bombs” is to encourage universities to join the IIE Syria Consortium.</p>\n<p>According to the resolution, 90,000 to 110,000 Syrian students qualify for university admission “based on pre-war enrollment estimates.”</p>\n<p>American citizens would not be affected if the resolution were adopted because the student positions and financial aid would exclusively come from funding reserved for international students.</p>\n<p>Syrian students would get priority admission over other international students because of their country’s need for education.</p>\n<p>If the resolution is passed at UCSB, the UC and the program may face political backlash from conservative groups across the nation.</p>\n<p>Nawar Nameh, a third-year history of public policy and global studies double major, said he believes the Syrian students’ efforts to attend American universities could be thwarted by the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“I’m very worried about that,” Nameh said. “They might start passing executive action that could curtail immigration completely.”</p>\n<p>The refugees are arriving in the United States through regular means of immigration, so their entry could be threatened by President Trump’s executive order, which was drafted Wednesday, to temporarily block refugees from entering the United States and suspend visas of those from Syria and six other Middle Eastern countries.</p>\n<p>“These refugees would be coming through standard immigration paths, so if these paths get shut down, then there’s no way for them to get here,” Nameh said. “Then we’re going to have to address a much bigger issue.”</p>\n<p>The resolution is currently in the A.S. External Committee, which will discuss it further in a meeting Friday. If it passes through the committee, it will be considered and voted on at the A.S. Senate meeting on Feb. 1.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: Participating universities have gained 17,665 signatures in support of scholarships for Syrian students, they have not created that number of scholarships.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

election; Patterson performed poetry and spoke on black history. <em>Soham Tikekar / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Renowned minds in art and academia flew into Santa Barbara this week to discuss the concept of civility in the face of hatred and violence at UCSB Student Affairs’ newest series.</p>\n<p>Award-winning spoken word artist Sunni Patterson and David Kim, the department chair of racial and religious studies at Connecticut College, were invited to UCSB by George Lipsitz, a professor of sociology and black studies.</p>\n<p>A Tuesday night event was held at the St. George Family Youth Center in Isla Vista, featuring only Patterson, and a Wednesday night event included both Patterson and Kim.</p>\n<p>Kim said he accepted Lipsitz’s request because Lipsitz felt there was a “brokenness” to the culture of the campus.</p>\n<p>“There were incidents on the campus where racism and xenophobia were affecting the first-generation students,” Kim said. “We wanted to set a theme for the year about how might love be a way for the culture to heal itself.”</p>\n<p>Their goal was to promote conversation and help inspire creative work, in addition to “letting seeds grow,” Patterson said.</p>\n<p>The Wednesday event was held in the Lotte Lehmann Concert Hall in panel form. Lipsitz, as the host, asked questions while Patterson and Kim answered. The room was packed with students and visitors alike.</p>\n<p>“Love-driven politics” was Kim’s main theme. He talked about the resilience of love in the face of hate and power struggles in the political scene. Using his own upbringing as an example, he started off with a word of gratitude toward the organizers of the event. He said he hoped the same sincere gratitude would be present in the political sphere.</p>\n<p>Kim also talked about the culture of hate as perpetrated by the Trump campaign and the effects of such hate, including political gridlock in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, most of Paterson’s themes focused on her phrase “Freedom is now!” Using her cultural background for context, Patterson explored the history of African Americans.</p>\n<p>She recounted her visit to Ghana in the early 2000s, where she was told of the plight of early African slaves who were stowed on ships “packed like sardines” with only the ability “to move your head or a foot.”</p>\n<p>Another anecdote she shared was her own experience with pain, loss and lack of freedom during Hurricane Katrina. As a New Orleans native, she endured the storm personally, and it was the inspiration for much of her poetry. The idea behind the phrase “Freedom is now!” she said, is that one has to seize the moment.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.1 of the Thursday, October 6, 2016 print edition of
