Of the 40 teams participating, UCSB will directly compete against four randomly selected teams in two civil trials per day, in which the teams will alternate as plaintiff and defendant. </p>\n<p>According to Mock Trial Vice President and second-year history major Cheryl Wilson, the invitation to Yale is a sign of Mock Trial’s strong reputation as a competitive team.</p>\n<p>“The way that invitationals usually work is that teams from the area are invited. But for the larger tournaments, they try to recruit teams from the larger areas in the U.S., because at nationals, you go against teams from all over the country,” Wilson said. “So if you’re a well known up-and-coming team from another geographic area, you have a much better chance of being invited.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major and Mock Trial Co-Captain Brett Russell said the tournament will expose UCSB’s team to different competition styles.</p>\n<p>“It’s also a good learning opportunity, because we’ve never seen the styles and the specific attorneys from the East Coast. We definitely could learn a lot from them,” Russell said.  “We see the same teams at every West Coast invitational, and we know almost everyone by name. It becomes kind of a small club.”</p>\n<p>Wilson said the East Coast teams have a large presence in the national competition, which will take place next year.</p>\n<p>“California is a very competitive state for Mock Trial, and we definitely have a pocket of good teams here, but just because there’s so many colleges on the East Coast, a lot of the major teams that win the national competition are from there,” Wilson said. “I would say two or three out of the top 10 teams are usually from California, and the rest are from the East Coast. So for us, it’s an experience to go against upper-level competitors.” </p>\n<p>Fourth-year philosophy and history double major and Mock Trial Co-Captain Andrew Cavarno said the Yale Invitational is important to the university because it emphasizes the Mock Trial team’s renown national reputation.</p>\n<p>“This is really our first step on the east coast, so how well we do here will definitely influence our national reputation,” Cavarno said.</p>\n<p>According to Cavarno, the six student participants to the Yale invitational have been holding extra practice sessions, but the competition is similar enough to past tournaments in that it will not require a change in the team’s practice style.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been preparing really hard for all of our invitationals, and because they all follow a similar format, we don’t need to prepare specifically for Yale,” Cavarno said, “but I would say that we’ve been preparing a little bit harder.”</p>\n<p>According to Russell, presentation is an important aspect of securing a trial victory.</p>\n<p>“When you’re making an oral argument, like an opening statement, it’s obviously important to have good content,” Russell said, “but what’s often more important is good presentation.”<br>\nWilson said the mock trial team members are confident in their ability to succeed in the competition.</p>\n<p>“We’re going out there to bring the UCSB name out to the East Coast,” Wilson said.<br>\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-58694\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-58694\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-11-21/ucsb-mock-trial-to-compete-in-2014-yale-invitational/","id":2955,"author":{"id":171,"name":"Diana Bounina"},"related":[2954,2953,2952],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

Will Tran/<em>Daily Nexus.</em></p></div>\n<p>The Associated Students Senate met last night to discuss new amendments and bills regarding the recording of Senate meetings, the upcoming Student of Color Conference and capabilities to remove A.S. staff.</p>\n<p>A.S. Internal Vice President Angela Lau began the discussion by addressing the current bills in question and moved the conversation to Senate member inquiries before allowing time for public forum.</p>\n<p>Diane O’Brien, executive assistant to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, gave an update prior to public forum about an ongoing housing shortage for international students.</p>\n<p>“We’re currently trying to work with them to find out how many have and don’t have housing at the moment,” O’Brien said. “What I’ve been told is that, for whatever reason, the housing market has been impacted and that it was an unexpected thing. The school isn’t overenrolled, the students are just having difficulty finding housing.”</p>\n<p>After public forum, a motion was introduced to permit the videotaping of Senate meetings in order to have them available for public viewing. The motion was voted on and then sent to the Constitution and Bylaws Committee for further consideration.</p>\n<p>Diversity Educator for the Student Commission on Racial Equality (S.C.O.R.E.) Kyron Covington requested Senate funding for the upcoming Student of Color Conference, to take place on Nov. 7 to 9 at UC Merced. Covington said the conference was a chance for students of color to discuss issues relevant to “color culture” and their specific universities.</p>\n<p>“It is a chance to celebrate students of color culture and talk about issues that they can bring back to their respective campuses,” Covington said.</p>\n<p>Senator Liam Stanton also requested A.S. President Ali Guthy to fund the Student of Color Conference with presidential funds. Guthy said an examination of the budget was necessary before any funds could be appropriated.</p>\n<p>Third-year literature major and former Student Advocate General Bailey Loverin also sponsored an update to A.S. Legal Code Article VII Sections 3 and 8-10, with the intent of preventing what she alleged was the unjust removal of A.S. staff.</p>\n<p>“[The bill] does not allow executives to remove appointed officers without consent of the Senate,” Loverin said.</p>\n<p>A.S. Executive Director Marcela Marquez brought up issues of student health and the possibility of establishing “peace zones” in the school to aid students dealing with various stages of post-traumatic stress.</p>\n<p>“The administration and the Chancellor are working together to develop peaceful areas in the school for students to be able to relax,” Marquez said.</p>\n<p>Senate questions were addressed towards the end of the meeting, with Lau encouraging Senators to spread news of the upcoming special A.S. Election for Student Advocate General and External Vice President of Local Affairs in order to gain results reflective of the entire student body.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 6 of Thursday, October 23, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57251\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57251\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-23/a-s-senate-hears-funding-request/","id":2983,"author":{"id":171,"name":"Diana Bounina"},"related":[2982,2981,2980],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/171"}},"__N_SSG":true}
