Staples is an artist with a street cred as long as his list of collaborations with artists like Odd Future and Mac Miller. In his new album, the seasoned rapper tells a disarmingly honest and uncomfortably up-front story that takes the listener by the hand through the streets of Long Beach. Never overwhelmingly edgy nor depressingly pessimistic, <em>Hell Can Wait </em>has Staples echoing “Hope I outlive them red roses,” a lyrical sign of the artist’s morning star peeking over the proverbial Long Beach horizon.</p>\n<p>Though the album is only half an hour long, don’t mistake brevity for lack of depth and versatility. The rapper offers his thoughts on everything from gangbanging to police brutality from his own experiences in a coherent, rational fashion. Never hurried, the lyrics come from a deeply rooted place that he offers as soul food to his audience.</p>\n<p>In “65 Hunnid,” Staples reflects on his days gangbanging, reminiscing “You alone / Car full of n*ggas but you alone / It’s time to show how much you love your homies.” Juxtaposing sex and gangbanging, Staples shows that his story isn’t the typical, “get money mo’ money” stories saturating the gangster rap industry.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Rather, his tales are told in the “still-life” moments of hustling, the day-to-day moments of living on the streets. In a recent interview with <em>Pitchfork</em>, Staples compares music to being “in the zoo, and the listeners are the people outside of the cage … you’re not going to step inside that glass, because you know what’ll happen to you. [But] Rappers are making this shit a petting zoo.” Whether that’s a verdict on the rap industry as a whole or Staples offering his thoughts on his song-writing process is up for interpretation.</p>\n<p>A lack of glorification of gang culture is a defining aspect of <em>Hell Can Wait</em>. Staples’ constant themes about the Dickensian aspect of the street-life, from selling drugs to riding with his homies, solidifies his credo as one of the most genuine rappers today. In “Screen Door,” he explores his past living with his drug-dealing father and working-class mother, ranting, “Bobby Johnson ain’t my OG / this ain’t no movie, bro.” Laid over an unobtrusive beat and instrumental, Staples chants, “Who’s that peekin’ in my screen door” in between verses of his father’s evolution from drug-dealing to more criminal activities. In a previous mixtape, Staples meditates on his father’s crime, rapping, “Dad did time ‘cause he sold drugs for me / I could never judge a man trying to better off his fam.” Though weak on raw emotion, “Screen Door” is prototypical of the whole album, touching on everything from his mother’s teenage pregnancy, his father’s drug fiasco and his own burning passion for money and respect on the streets.</p>\n<p>And, what’s a ghetto gospel going to be without mention of the police? In “Hands Up,” Staples’ ire against the police and school district comes alive, as he rants, “LAPD, they ain’t ‘bout shit.” His lyrics takes on a caustic quality. Criticizing the police’s use of excessive force, Staples’ lyrics are reminiscent of recent events in Ferguson and reference America’s failed war on crime. Echoing fellow artist Run the Jewels, Staples sardonically reflects, “Paying taxes for some fucking clowns to ride around.” According to Staples, Orwellian state oppression has held him down long enough and his lyrics burst with that tension.</p>\n<p>Staples’ future is undoubtedly going to be full of success. Judging from his prolific nature in the past two years, fans probably won’t have to wait too long for another taste. <em>Hell Can Wait </em>is only a freshman EP and Staples is no doubt working on his next album, a prospect that both excites and terrifies this reviewer. Staples’ development over the years shows that his mentors have taught him many useful technical tricks that will prove critically important as he gains more attention in the hip hop community. He has already achieved much by signing on to Def Jam Records. Now all he needs to do is prove that he earned it, a definite struggle in the works.</p>\n<p>Hip hop has always been a trinity between dance, rap and graffiti, the whole being greater than the sum of all three. It has also always been an identity of the oppressed, of the powerless. But as hip hop became more mainstream over the last decade, the community has been more and more marginalized.</p>\n<p>One instance of this was <em>Forbes</em> magazine’s suggestion that the much-maligned rapper Iggy Azalea ‘ran hip hop,’ which drew much criticism of readers and forced the magazine to alter the title of the article. And, even though <em>Forbes</em> is a business magazine that has no relevance in music reporting, the response is symptomatic of a larger disconnect between the mainstream, deridingly-labeled “sell-outs” and their moderate hip hop fans, and the less-well-known underground rappers and their hardcore hip hop fans.</p>\n<p>As Vince Staples walks across the tightrope of success, he must listen to both these groups and his instincts as an artist. There isn’t a <em>Dummy’s Guide to Success as a Hip Hop Artist</em>. He needs to stay relevant in an industry ruled by dance music. But he also needs to stay genuine and true to his art. Whatever he’s going to choose, only time will tell.

Neither did I until I watched “It.” Originally a TV-miniseries, this faithful adaptation of the book by Stephen King will leave you keyed up and on edge throughout its three-hour run time. “It” is a thriller-mystery following seven kids and later seven adults as they try to come to terms with supernatural events surrounding a killer clown named Pennywise. Ghouls and terrifying creations abound, and the movie’s theatrics are sure to make you look down every drain and up every spout. And, if you are worried about the movie running late, don’t worry. You’re not going to be sleeping anyway. Note: Coulrophobia refers to fear of clowns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>9 Hours to Midnight —</strong> <strong> “The Conjuring” (2013)</strong></p>\n<p>Released with the likes of “Carrie” (2013) and “Dark Skies” (2013), “The Conjuring” is probably the best horror movie released in the four years since “Haunting in Connecticut” (2009). In spite of stiff competition and an atmosphere of rehashed movie topics in Hollywood, this movie has done wonders at the box office. Although the plot lacks in originality, the twists and the apparition makes this movie a must-see. Bone-chillingly fresh suspense keeps the pace of the movie onwards. Pro Tip: Conjure yourself an extra pair of pants before watching; you will need them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>16 Hours to Midnight — “The Hills Have Eyes” (2006)</strong></p>\n<p>It’s with happy <em>schadenfreude</em> that I present to you “The Hills Have Eyes.” Set in the Mojave Desert, a family of seven are hunted by a group of mutants looking for flesh and blood. This slasher/psychological thriller shocks the mind with grotesque violence and moments of adrenaline-fueled mayhem. Like any good horror movie, it strains against the limits of civility and pushes away common decency in a terrible display of death. Note: <em>Schadenfreude, </em>a German term, translates to “harm joy,” or pleasure at another’s misfortune.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>12 Hours to Midnight — “The Blair Witch Project” (1999)</strong></p>\n<p>Arguably the film that created the ‘found films’ genre of horror, “The Blair Witch Project” is a cult film in its own right. Its plot centers on a group of college students who enter the Maryland forest with cameras to track down the legendary Blair Witch, only to disappear. An investigation ensues and the main evidence discovered is the cameras. The story and unknown forces that haunt these students all add to the film’s scariness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>8 Hours to Midnight — “The Shining” (1980)</strong></p>\n<p>How many times have you heard someone make a reference to this film in the last week? One time? Two times? Five times? This movie has thoroughly infected the horror genre’s consciousness. Led by legendary film director, Stanley Kubrick, this Stephen King novel-adapted movie is about a couple and their young son taking a winter vacation up in the Colorado mountain ranges to manage the Overlook Hotel. The story, albeit very unfaithful to the original novel, nevertheless haunts audiences throughout the world in its depiction of the Overlook Hotel. The characters are strong and the setting isn’t lacking in creepiness. The lack of detail and resolution sets a mysterious vibe that is difficult to shake off.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>4 Hours to Midnight — “Mama” (2013)</strong></p>\n<p>“The Ring” (2002) meets “The Grudge” (2004) in “Mama.” Directed by master of horror Guillermo del Toro, “Mama” is about two girls that are discovered in a cabin in the woods four years after their father abducted them. Their uncle and his girlfriend take them in as adopted daughters, only to find that something else has also been invited in as well.</p>\n<p>“Mama” has a moving plot and a great character cast. Far from being simple props that get horribly slaughtered, the characters elicit sympathy and pity for their misfortunes. Of course, like any horror thriller, the tension is racked up constantly in the melancholy setting. Note: “Game of Thrones” fans, if you ever wanted to see Jaime Lannister take on creepy ghosts, then this is the film for you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Midnight — “Silent Hill” (2006)</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the video game that sparked the genesis of the Western horror genre, “Silent Hill” is responsible for multiple game adaptations, including one produced by Guillermo del Toro expected to be released in 2016, and another movie sequel, “Silent Hill Revelations” (2012). Not to be confused with the slasher-thriller, “The Hills Have Eyes” (2006), “Silent Hill” (2006) is about a mother who takes her adopted daughter up to the mountains of West Virginia. In her journey, she accidentally ventures into an otherworldly, surrealistic dimension, to find her daughter in Silent Hill. Full of occult-ish creatures, pyramid men and dead nurses, this movie is chock full of frightening twists and turns that will leave you unable to stay still. The visual special effects are spot-on and the atmosphere is sure to haunt you on foggy days. Take this journey down Silent Hill and you’ll never regret it — until you can’t sleep, of course.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Through this journey, I hope you learn all the twists and turns of your deepest nightmares. No doubt, if you follow this list, you will find yourself screaming in terror. Try not to regret the nightmares or the creepy feeling of being watched that will undoubtedly follow — be one with your dark passenger.</p>\n<p><em>Jon Choi will be watching all of these movies in the dorms of Montecito House. He suggests you knock three times, pause, then knock again to be invited in.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://iframewidth=560height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/7Am7i7uM9r0frameborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/7Am7i7uM9r0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></a></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-57657\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-57657\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-30/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-24-hour-movie-scarathon/","id":6052,"author":{"id":753,"name":"Jon Choi"},"related":[6051,6050,6049],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/753"}},"__N_SSG":true}
