Students who qualify for the program are promised an estimated $120,000 in financial aid over four years if they remain Cal Grant or Pell Grant eligible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose said that the goal of the stations is to provide students who are hungry with a quick snack during the middle of their days, with options such as granola bars, trail mix, fig bars and fruit snacks, and to supply menstrual products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of the frustrations that motivated this project was that in order to get into the dining commons and access the [A.S.] Food Bank, you need to have a student ID, and our [Promise Scholar] kids often lose their IDs so $35 is a lot of money to replace it,” Roose said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stations have been placed in 10 locations on campus, including the Transfer Student Center, Opening New Doors to Accelerating Success Student Center, UCSB Student Health, the MultiCultural Center, the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, El Centro, College of Letters and Sciences Advising in Cheadle Hall, the Athletics Department, the Educational Opportunity Program and the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roose explained that the new project was funded by the California government, which allocated around $80,000. The grant is designated to be spent by June and will be a contender for renewal if the project succeeds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students with a heavy academic workload, sitting down for a meal during the day is not always feasible. Fifth-year biochemistry and molecular biology major and Promise Scholar Sami Kaayal said the conveniently placed snacks have helped him stay fueled during busy days. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Having a decent chunk of those snacks throughout the week can help me whether I’m rushing to class and I don’t have time to eat breakfast … or just as supplemental snacks throughout the day between classes,” Kaayal said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the Promise Scholars Program represents low-income students, Roose explained that the healthy snacks and menstrual products are available to all students on campus, regardless of income. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Promise Scholars Program deals with very low-income students, but the middle-class students fall through the cracks on this campus as well,” Roose said. “They don’t get financial aid but they can’t necessarily pay for college either so some of the middle-class students are even needier sometimes.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“At the end of the day, I just want hungry students to get food and proper sanitary products.”</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aniket Mehrotra</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributed reporting. </span></em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article

data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-92440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The idea of Quokka Brew was initially ridiculed but has proven successful and financially self-sustaining. <em>Courtesy of Adam Chohan</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student-run coffee company, known as Quokka Brew, was created at UC Berkeley and is now expanding to other campuses across California. As president of the Quokka Brew Ambassador Program at UCSB, fourth-year chemical engineering major Adam Chohan said he is helping expand the brew to UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chohan said he first heard about Quokka Brew from UC Berkeley students Ofek Arush and George Passantino, who realized they needed caffeine during finals week in 2018 but found that the anxious jitters and excessive sugar that come with coffee weren’t worth it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The co-founders then formulated the idea for an ideal brew that would be an effective energizer and healthier alternative to traditional brews. They soon after consulted with chemists and food scientists in the Bay Area to craft this into a reality, Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five months later, Quokka Brew was being distributed in 4-ounce glass bottles around the Berkeley and San Francisco area — marked with a beaming quokka, a small marsupial similar in size to a cat. Containing 15 calories, 1 gram of sugar and almond milk, Quokka Brew is currently the healthiest non-black coffee on the market, Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chohan, the science surrounding Quokka Brew’s effectiveness revolves around the circulatory system, where some coffee drinkers experience caffeine’s infamous jitters.     </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Caffeine normally restricts your veins, so less blood pumping through the circulatory system causes the heart to start pumping harder and counteract that, which is where the jitters and anxiety arise from,” Chohan explained. “The amino acids in [the Quokka] blend act as vasodilators which dilate the veins so blood flows through the circulatory system with the same caffeine intake.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of Quokka Brew — to provide the benefits of caffeine without its negative side effects — was initially ridiculed as an impossible feat but has proven successful and financially self-sustaining, Chohan said. The brew is sold in 10 stores across the Bay Area and is backed by a team of 46 students at UC Berkeley. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the company transitions into its second year of production, it continues to expand to college campuses across the state, including Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Sacramento State and now UCSB. Across each campus, the company tables, creates ambassador programs and works to get the product sold in nearby stores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The steps we are taking here are very similar to the steps that UC Berkeley took but they are happening a lot quicker because the response has been really awesome. I think mostly it is because people are very friendly here and students are eager to support student-run business models,” Chohan said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While popularity grows on campus, the company is looking forward to making some pivotal adjustments including using a fair-trade coffee roaster and transitioning to aluminum cans. The brew is currently only available at Sam’s To Go in I.V., but Chohan said they hope to soon sell Quokka Brew at the UCen, the Arbor and the Corner Store on campus. </span></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Jan. 30, 2020 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-92439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-02/on-the-grind-student-run-coffee-company-drips-down-to-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-92439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-02/on-the-grind-student-run-coffee-company-drips-down-to-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-02/on-the-grind-student-run-coffee-company-drips-down-to-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-02/on-the-grind-student-run-coffee-company-drips-down-to-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-02/on-the-grind-student-run-coffee-company-drips-down-to-ucsb/","id":3378,"author":{"id":260,"name":"Celeste Chavez Hernandez"},"related":[3377,3376,3375],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/260"}},"__N_SSG":true}
