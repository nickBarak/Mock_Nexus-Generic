Deputies located the woman in question at 6503 Madrid Road in Isla Vista, where she told officers more details about her situation.<br>\n“The woman stated she was on a life-changing mission and that her great grandmother just passed away today,” Plastino said. “She also said her life mission is to bring world peace and end violence against humanity.”<br>\nPlastino said the woman alternated between sobbing and smiling “all within seconds,” before standing up in an attempt to remove her clothes.<br>\n“The woman stood up, removed her top and began to remove her sweatpants. Deputies were able to prevent her from pulling down her sweatpants,” Plastino said. “Deputies then handcuffed the woman and asked her friend to put the shirt back on the woman. The friend assisted and helped cover the woman up.”<br>\nAccording to Plastino, the woman was later transferred to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital for a complete medical evaluation.<br>\nOn Friday evening, deputies received a call reporting a robbery at an apartment on El Colegio Road. The victim who made the call said he was approached by two adult males while taking out his trash, according to Plastino, who said the victim described the suspects as “two black ‘gangster-looking’ males.”<br>\n“One of the males threw him down and started punching him in the face,” Plastino said, while adding that the victim gave the suspect his full prescription of Xanax, which the victim had inside his wallet in his pocket.<br>\nAccording to Plastino, the property manager of the victim’s apartment complex verified the story as a witness to the incident. The investigation is ongoing.<br>\nOn Saturday night, a UCSB student injured himself while attempting to escape from IVFP deputies while intoxicated, Plastino said.<br>\n“[The subject] was extremely drunk and attempted to run upon contact by Foot Patrol,” Plastino said. “He was chased and caught by two deputies, at which time he sustained an abrasion above the eye.”<br>\nPlastino said medics were called to treat the man’s injuries and shortly after receiving treatment, he was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail for assaulting one of the medical personnel.<br>\nIsla Vista also saw a series of laptop robberies this weekend, according to Plastino. Six laptops were stolen over the weekend — two on Saturday and four on Sunday. On Saturday night, two different laptops were stolen from separate houses on Del Playa Drive, with one stolen through an unlocked bedroom door during a house party while the other was taken from a female victim’s room while she slept. On Sunday, two laptops were taken from a house on Trigo Road from an unlocked backdoor and another two laptops were taken from a residence on Cervantes Road through an unlocked door.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, May 14, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55302\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55302\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/weekend-wrap-up-29/","id":3799,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3798,3797,3796],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up (5-2 to 5-5 2014)","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to the discovery of a dead female body on the beach as well as an occurrence of shoplifting, among other minor incidents.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to the discovery of a dead female body on the beach as well as an occurrence of shoplifting, among other minor incidents.</p>\n<p>According IVFP Station Lieutenant Robert Plastino, deputies responded following a call by a cyclist at approximately 7:00 a.m. on Sunday to report a female body lying on the beach. Police and fire officials determined that the female was deceased and later identified the female as second-year junior and double major in language, culture and society and philosophy Sierra Markee-Winkler.</p>\n<p>Plastino said police were able to determine the body as Markee-Winkler due to help from her roommate and forensic evidence.</p>\n<p>“During an area canvas, IVFP was approached by a female subject, who observed us carrying the decedent from the beach and was concerned that it may have been her missing roommate,” Plastino said. “Using forensics and a lead provided by [Winkler’s] roommate, the decedent’s identity was verified.”</p>\n<p>Plastino said investigation into the circumstances surrounding Markee-Winkler’s death are ongoing and that although a cause of death has not yet been determined, Markee-Winkler was missing the night before.</p>\n<p>“Preliminary investigation revealed that Markee-Winkler was involved in an argument with one of her roommates at her residence,” Plastino said. “Markee-Winkler, who had been drinking and was upset, left the residence and headed toward the 6800 block of Del Playa.”</p>\n<p>However, Plastino said that while Markee-Winkler was reported to be emotional when she left the scene, there was no sign of foul play and no one had followed her.</p>\n<p>“[The] Sheriff’s, Coroner’s and forensic team are working to determine the cause of death,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Until a full autopsy is completed, Plastino said, there are several possible causes of death, including a fall from the cliff. But Plastino said it is likely Markee-Winkler died from other causes due to her experience living in I.V. and the fact that her phone and sandals were found neatly placed behind the residence located at 6865 Del Playa.</p>\n<p>“Initially, we were thinking she accidentally fell off, but then we realized this is not the typical fall from the cliff. Unlike other victims, who are usually out-of-towners or [freshmen], she was a junior and knew the area well,” Plastino said. “But there is nothing to indicate that she threw herself off on purpose.”</p>\n<p>Plastino also said it was possible Markee-Winkler had gone down to the beach and fallen asleep on the sand when the waves were at low tide and was later unable to escape the high tide currents.</p>\n<p>“Remember, it is pitch black down there at night and the water is freezing. In that water, she wouldn’t have lasted 15 minutes,” Plastino said. “We have a lot of questions that still need to be answered.”</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, deputies also responded to a call on Saturday afternoon at approximately 1:05 p.m. from the Movement Ink store on 6556 Pardall Road. The store’s owner had detained an individual suspected of shoplifting.</p>\n<p>“The owner of the store was standing inside the shop detaining [the suspect]. The shop owner signed a citizen’s arrest form and stated [the suspect] walked out of the store with a hat worth $40 concealed under his shirt,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>The owner confronted the suspect outside, Plastino said, which is when the suspect revealed the hat. After performing a background check on the suspect, officers discovered he had committed other acts of theft in the past.</p>\n<p>“[The suspect] admitted to law enforcement that he hid the hat under his shirt,” Plastino said. “A record check showed [the suspect] had been arrested less than a month prior for shoplifting at 7-Eleven and was a person of interest in a residential burglary in 2013.”</p>\n<p>The suspect was arrested and eventually released with a citation for theft.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Wednesday, May 7, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55193\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55193\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-07/weekend-wrap-up-5-2-to-5-5-2014/","id":3793,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3792,3791,3790],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several criminal incidents in Isla Vista involving UCSB students, Isla Vista residents and individuals from outside the community.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several criminal incidents in Isla Vista involving UCSB students, Isla Vista residents and individuals from outside the community.</p>\n<p>Police officers responded to cases including a false report of stolen property, assault, possession of illegal drugs and the sale of marijuana without a license. The weekend began with a report of assault that took place on the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies responded to an assault case on 6671 Del Playa that involved a student from San Diego State University and an unidentified victim. Isla Vista Foot Patrol Lt. Robert Plastino said in-field witnesses assisted officers with the investigation.</p>\n<p>“A 21-year-old SDSU student sucker-punched the victim from behind, knocking him unconscious, causing lacerations requiring sutures and breaking a front tooth,” Plastino said. “[There was] no motivation to punch the victim. It was for no reason — out of the blue.”</p>\n<p>The suspect was charged with assault and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail. That same night, officers arrested an out-of-town visitor for indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs at the residence of 6563 Trigo Road.</p>\n<p>“A 20-year-old Claremont resident was observed by multiple reporting parties and incoming deputies to be actively exposing his genitals for gratification purposes,” Plastino said. “He was arrested and also found to be in possession of cocaine.”</p>\n<p>During the daytime on Saturday, deputies arrested Isla Vista local Jamal Blue for selling marijuana on the 6600 block of Trigo Road. According to Plastino, deputies watched Blue conduct a hand-to-hand transaction with a UCSB student.</p>\n<p>“Investigation found that Jamal had provided the student with marijuana. He was arrested and booked into Santa Barbara County Jail,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, a stolen iPhone was recovered at Freebirds last Wednesday. He said the victim texted the suspect who was in possession of the phone.</p>\n<p>“The suspect, [a] Freebirds employee, confirmed the serial number and said he had purchased it from a UCSB student,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>When the victim demanded the phone back, Plastino said the employee requested a $180 reimbursement from the victim. According to Plastino, the suspect was eventually discovered to be speaking falsely about the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the phone.</p>\n<p>“The suspect was lying. He had found the phone and was trying to force the victim to pay him in order to get it back,” Plastino</p>\n<p>Plastino said IVFP took measures to detain the suspect, who was found not only to be in possession of the iPhone but also of a meth pipe. With this finding, the suspect was booked into Santa Barbara County Jail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, April 30, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55089\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55089\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/weekend-wrap-up-28/","id":3798,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3797,3796,3795],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Spring Break Crime Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last week, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of incidents including several assaults, one of which involved assault by use of machete, and alcohol-related crimes.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Last week, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of incidents including several assaults, one of which involved assault by use of machete, and alcohol-related crimes.</p>\n<p>The incidents occurred at intervals of about one-to-two days and ranged from assaults that resulted in deeper flesh wounds to a near-miss injury. Crimes occurring later in the week included an arrest for unlicensed marijuana possession and the usual distribution of citations for minors in possession of alcohol.</p>\n<p>According to Sergeant Rob Plastino, officers received a call early morning last Monday on March 24 from an individual reporting that a masked man went into his home and assaulted him with a machete. The suspect, Plastino said, was wearing a mask, hoodie and all black clothing.</p>\n<p>“The victim said he was in his residence and while there, someone entered his house,” Plastino said. “The victim received a wound that was two inches deep and two inches long on his arm. It seems that he raised his arms to defend himself from the assailant’s attack.”</p>\n<p>The victim then fled to I.V. Food Coop where he contacted the police. Plastino said the victim was transported to the hospital shortly after, and now the incident is facing investigation.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday night, deputies responded to a call from a victim that stated his roommate punched him several times in the head. According to Plastino, deputies who arrived at the victim’s residence observed that he had “a large welt on the backside of his head,” although the man refused medical attention.</p>\n<p>“The suspect states that the victim was being disrespectful because he was having sex with his [the suspect’s] girlfriend in front of him,” Plastino said. “Because the victim wanted to press charges, the suspect was arrested and booked into jail.”</p>\n<p>Also on Wednesday night, deputies responded to a call that there was a large in-progress fight outside 6776 Del Playa Drive. When officers arrived, most of the crowd scattered except for one individual, whom deputies approached.</p>\n<p>“The suspect was found to be drunk in public and while being arrested, he started a fight with deputies and kicked a police sergeant several times,” Plastino said. “He was booked with multiple charges, including public intoxication and assault on a police officer.”</p>\n<p>On Friday night, deputies on patrol near Del Playa and Camino Majorca contacted four people sitting inside a car, smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol. According to Plastino, when an officer approached the vehicle and the driver rolled down the window, marijuana smoke emanated from the car.</p>\n<p>“The suspect had no marijuana license and the deputies determined that the passengers consisted of a 19-year-old male driver, a 23-year-old male sitting in the passenger seat and two 15-year-old females sitting in the back seat,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>Plastino stated that the 23-year old male was cited for multiple charges, including providing alcohol to minors. The 19-year-old male was cited with minor in possession of alcohol as well as other charges.</p>\n<p>“The two juvenile girls initially lied about their identity when contacted. Being fifteen, they had no driver licenses, but officers eventually discovered who they were … they are being charged with minor in possession and false representation.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday, a victim called 9-11 reporting that a 40-year-old man threw a rock at him, but missed.</p>\n<p>“When officers arrived at the scene, the suspect threw the rock behind a building where it could not be located,” Plastino said. “However, when officers made contact with the suspect, they discovered he was in possession of a stolen bike and a cell phone that was not his. He was arrested for assault and the possession of stolen property.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of Wednesday, April 2, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54554\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54554\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/spring-break-crime-wrap-up/","id":3796,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3795,3794,3793],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to various incidents including a drug bust, a battery case on Del Playa Drive and a series of residential burglaries.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to various incidents including a drug bust, a battery case on Del Playa Drive and a series of residential burglaries.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Sergeant Mark Signa, a college-aged male subject was arrested on Friday night for the possession of anti-anxiety medications without a prescription. Upon searching the vehicle, officers located six Xanax pills and the suspect was booked into jail for possession of Xanax without a prescription, according to Signa, who said the search was made following a traffic stop.</p>\n<p>“Deputies made a traffic stop for a subject whom failed to signal when turning on Cordoba,” Signa said. “It was discovered that the suspect was on probation for drug sales. Per the terms of his probation, his vehicle was searched.”</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officials also responded to a call for an injured adult male at a house party on the 6700 block of Del Playa on Friday night. When they arrived to the residence, officers found the injured suspect, who is 19-20 years old, at the base of a staircase as well as a victim nearby, according to Signa. He also said the victim was pointing at the injured suspect and saying the suspect was “kicking subjects as they attempted to walk up the stairs.”</p>\n<p>“The suspect was arrested for battery and booked into jail,” Signa said. “It is unknown whether the suspect was a student or not.”</p>\n<p>In addition, deputies responded to a call from the 6700 block of Del Playa reporting a residential burglary that had occurred sometime between the previous night and early Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>“An unknown suspect entered the victim’s residence from an unlocked front door,” Signa said. “Two laptops — both MacBook Pros — were taken and the investigation is continuing.”</p>\n<p>A second burglary was also reported early Sunday morning from the apartment complexes at 781 Embarcadero Del Norte, with the incident involving the theft of three Apple Macbook Pro laptop computers from an apartment living room at 5 a.m.</p>\n<p>“One of the [female] victims heard someone moving around in the apartment and called 9-1-1,” Signa said. “Neighbors saw a suspect loitering around the apartment building before the theft [and] described [him] as a large athletic, black male adult about 6’2, wearing a black hoodie. The area was searched but they were unable to locate him.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of Wednesday, March 5, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54360\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54360\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-05/weekend-wrap-up-27/","id":3788,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3787,3786,3785],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-Up","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to two cases of sexual assault — in addition to alcohol-related crimes and citations for trespassing and false imprisonment.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Over the weekend, Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to two cases of sexual assault — in addition to alcohol-related crimes and citations for trespassing and false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Local law enforcement have now released some of the details of a sexual assault incident that occurred on Friday night on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive. According to IVFP Sergeant Mark Signa, deputies observed a girl sitting on a curb near the Isla Vista 7-11 crying and saying she had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p>“She was very upset and — interviewed by IVPF — she stated she had been sexually assaulted on Del Playa Drive after leaving a party,” Signa said. “The suspect is unknown. He was either a Middle Eastern or Asian male.”</p>\n<p>On Saturday morning, deputies responded to a trespassing report on 6500 Del Playa Drive at 11 a.m. A female resident reported that at around 1:30 am, an unknown male had entered her home through a bathroom window. She and her boyfriend found the suspect, a college-aged Hispanic male, in their bathroom and then escorted him outside. After seeing the UCSB emergency alert regarding a sexual assault, the couple contacted officials and reported the incident.</p>\n<p>Also on Saturday night, Signa said deputies stopped a Del Playa resident from falsely imprisoning some of his party guests, after he attempted to flee authorities and prevented them from entering his house.</p>\n<p>“On Saturday night, on the 6700 block of Del Playa after midnight, several males were making lewd comments from their residence to passersby [mainly females], and in violation of noise ordinance,” Signa said.</p>\n<p>Signa states that when deputies attempted to make contact with the males, they ran inside the house and refused to answer the door.</p>\n<p>“After 30 minutes of attempting to convince residents to open the door, deputies observed a female attempting to leave but was being physically restrained. The door was forced open. Approximately 70 people were inside,” Signa said. “Two people were contacted inside that were trying to leave, but were not allowed to.”</p>\n<p>One resident was given a citation for obstruction of justice and a misdemeanor charge of false imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Between 11 p.m. on Saturday and 4 a.m. on Sunday, another sexual assault occurred at an unknown location. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office reported that a 19-year-old female UCSB student was beaten and raped by three suspects described only as “Asian males.”</p>\n<p>According to Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, before the incident, the victim was last seen walking alone between midnight and 12:30 a.m. near Embarcadero Del Mar and Segovia Road. The Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department is working alongside Isla Vista Foot Patrol and UC Police Department to locate the crime scene and suspects.</p>\n<p>At approximately 4:15 p.m. on Tuesday, County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue volunteers were called in to search for any evidence that could assist with the investigation. They also plan to search possible crime scenes in eastern Isla Vista and on the UCSB campus.</p>\n<p>Hoover said the victim was released from the hospital Monday afternoon and is now with her family.</p>\n<p>The location of this assault and the suspects in both cases of sexual assault are still unknown.

IVFP Sherriff’s Lieutenant Robert Plastino said deputies encountered an individual stealing from a vehicle in an alleyway on Picasso Road on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>The suspect was identified as Sergio Torres, a resident from Ventura, who told officers he was visiting a friend. Lieutenant Plastino reported that Torres was found to be in possession of a mask, gloves, a flashlight and wire cutters.</p>\n<p>Shortly after officers requested additional sheriff units from Goleta, a man named Dennis Rizzo — who is a friend of Torres’s — was located and apprehended on the 700 block of Camino Del Sur. According to Plastino, Rizzo was found in possession of stolen property and attempted to hide some of his burglary tools upon being spotted by police. After examining the recovered stolen items, deputies determined that the two had targeted multiple areas with smash-and-grab auto burglary that night — including locations at 6512 Segovia, El Greco and Embarcadero Del Mar, as well as locations in Montecito.</p>\n<p>Plastino said the pair was right in the midst of their theft schemes when they were spotted by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>“[They] were in the process of looking for more cars to break into when they got caught,” Plastino said. “Both were on probation out of Ventura County for theft charge and are facing several charges in SB County,”</p>\n<p>The following night, on Friday, IVFP officers responded to another auto-theft incident.</p>\n<p>“An unknown suspect took the victim’s vehicle registration, insurance card, and FM transmitter from her unsecured vehicle that was parked in front of 6522 El Greco Road,” Plastino said.Sh</p>\n<p>Although one fingerprint was found and submitted to the County Forensics Department, no description of the suspect is available.</p>\n<p>Later that evening, in the early hours of Saturday morning, at around 1 a.m., deputies responded to a victim who reported being assaulted after trying to break up a fight on the 6500 block of Sabado Tarde.</p>\n<p>“A student was walking westbound on 6500 block Sabado Tarde and saw four men fighting. He attempted to break up the fight and while he was doing so, an unknown person punched him from behind. He lost consciousness and broke his jaw,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>The victim was immediately transported to the emergency room for treatment and surgery, according to Plastino, but he was unable to provide a description of the suspect.</p>\n<p>Plastino commented that, although the victim had positive intentions, witnesses should always first call 911 for help.</p>\n<p>That same evening, deputies responded to another assault incident on the 6700 block of Del Playa, Plastino said.</p>\n<p>“Deputies contacted the victim, who sustained a head injury as a result of the fight,” Plastino said. “Separately, deputies arrested the suspect in the nearby area. The suspect was identified by the victim as one of the people that had kicked him in the head.”</p>\n<p>According to Plastino, the suspect was booked for battery with serious bodily injury.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53852\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53852\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-04/police-respond-to-auto-thefts-assaults/","id":3785,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3784,3783,3782],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Recover Stolen Items, Search for Suspects","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of drug and alcohol-related offenses this weekend, as well as a strong-armed robbery and another incidence of theft.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to a series of drug and alcohol-related offenses this weekend, as well as a strong-armed robbery and another incidence of theft.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officials arrested a team of burglars, investigated a strong-armed robbery that led to no arrests, arrested a group of minors for possession of alcohol and fleeing arrest and investigated and arrested an individual for possession of prescription strength cough syrup and hash. Officials also arrested two unrelated individuals for simultaneous incidents of shoplifting and battery, as reported by the owner of the 7-Eleven on Embarcadero del Mar.</p>\n<p>According to IVFP Sheriff’s Lieutenant Robert Plastino, a strong-armed robbery occurred on El Greco Road at approximately 1:45 a.m. on Saturday. Plastino said the victim reports two males coming up to him on El Greco and hitting him repeatedly on the head.</p>\n<p>“He was knocked to the ground and when he asked what they wanted, they said ‘cash,’” Plastino said. “He gave them $40 from his wallet and the suspects fled toward UCSB.”</p>\n<p>The victim was not injured but was only able to give a limited description of his assailants, so police officers were unable to arrest anyone in connection with the incident. A UCSB emergency e-mail alert was sent to warn students of the incident and ask the public for further information.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at approximately 2:40 p.m. on Saturday, deputies intercepted and apprehended a suspected team of burglars, according to Plastino.</p>\n<p>“[California Highway Patrol] Officers observed a green GMC Envoy traveling northbound on Embarcadero Del Norte with one headlight out … and stopped the vehicle,” Plastino said. “IVFP deputies joined and contacted the people in the car. All were from Oxnard.”</p>\n<p>Upon checking their identities, officers discovered that two of the men had arrest warrants from Ventura County. The men were arrested and officers conducted a search on the car, which revealed several burglary tools including pry bars, cutting devices, flash lights, gloves and puncture tools. Officers also discovered a marijuana pipe, two methamphetamine pipes, a small supply of methamphetamine, three hypodermic syringes and Xanax.</p>\n<p>Plastino said officers recovered what appeared to be stolen goods, including eight cell phones and an Espana guitar in a black case that appeared to belong to an SBCC student.</p>\n<p>“All four men were arrested and charged with possession of burglary tools, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of hypodermic syringes, possession of prescripted meds without prescription [and] possession of stolen property,” Plastino said.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, according to Plastino, deputies also arrested an intoxicated subject who was jumping on the rear trunk of a parked vehicle.</p>\n<p>“When I asked why he jumped on the vehicle, his response was, ‘Because I’m intoxicated and making bad choices,’” Plastino said. “The suspect had his older brother’s identification inside his wallet. When asked why he had his brother’s ID, the suspect responded, ‘to buy alcohol of course.’”</p>\n<p>Although Plastino said “the level of honesty was very rare,” the suspect was arrested for being drunk in public, minor in possession, causing damage to another’s vehicle and possession of someone else’s identification.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-28/police-recover-stolen-items-search-for-suspects/","id":3787,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3786,3785,3784],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Club Tennis Team Places in National Competition","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Tennis","publish_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RecSports_JimmyChang.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/RecSports_JimmyChang.jpg?resize=400%2C258&ssl=1","description":"On April 11, UCSB’s club tennis team competed in the 2013 United States Tennis Association Tennis On Campus National Championship, a tournament drawing on over 600 college campuses across the nation...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On April 11, UCSB’s club tennis team competed in the 2013 United States Tennis Association Tennis On Campus National Championship, a tournament drawing on over 600 college campuses across the nation hosted in Surprise, Arizona.</span></p>\n<p>The USTA Tennis on Campus tournament accepts only the top 64 colleges and universities in the country for their national competition. This year, UCSB’s club team sent seven of its members, including Samantha Chou, Justin Vea, Ethan Nadler, Kevin Young, Daniel Reinhart and Christina and Robin Young.</p>\n<p>According to United States Tennis Association spokesperson Trina Singian, the tournament enables collegiate athletes to form positive relationships with competitors and their own personal goals.</p>\n<p>“The USTA’s Tennis On Campus program is designed to provide college students with opportunities for team camaraderie, social networking and rivaled competition through tennis,” Singian said. “Tennis On Campus offers co-ed team-based play, regional and national championship competition, and helps students maintain active and healthy lifestyles through their college years.”</p>\n<p>According to third-year computer science major and club tennis captain Daniel Reinhart, not only has the team placed 21st in the country, but this is the third season in a row the UCSB club tennis team has made the national tournament in their six years together.</p>\n<p>“Although we would have liked to have done better in the tournament, we still had an amazing time are looking forward to next year,” Reinhart said. “Fortunately, out of the six that went to nationals only one is graduating so we are expecting to have an even stronger team next year with incoming freshman and transfer students to add to the team.”</p>\n<p>Tennis club team captain and second-year chemistry major Kevin Young said the team’s success can be attributed to their intensive training regime and the leadership of their team trainer, Ben Oler.</p>\n<p>“The reason we were able to make it to Nationals was not based on sheer luck. It was, however, based completely off hard work and determination from each of our members that eventually paid off,” Young said. “Our team trainer has done an incredible job of whipping our team into top notch shape. In order to qualify for Nationals we had to overcome many obstacles, one of which was crushing USC and wiping the smug grin off their faces.”</p>\n<p>According to Young, though the team had their sights set on victory, the highlight of their trip revolved around team bonding.</p>\n<p>“When everyone is rooting and striving for the same cause, an inevitable sense of camaraderie washes over every member on the team and instead of being seven individuals, we become one,” Young said.</p>\n<p>Tennis club practices are every Tuesday at 7 p.m. and every Friday at 5 p.m. at the Rec Cen tennis courts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the April 25th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51056\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/ucsb-club-tennis-team-places-in-national-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51056\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/ucsb-club-tennis-team-places-in-national-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/ucsb-club-tennis-team-places-in-national-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/ucsb-club-tennis-team-places-in-national-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-25/ucsb-club-tennis-team-places-in-national-competition/","id":227,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[226,225,224],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Weekend Wrap-up April 23, 2013","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"During this past weekend, the Isla Vista Foot Patrol responded to several burglaries and alcohol-related crimes.

Commission on Student Well-Being, an organization dedicating to promoting healthy practices among UCSB students through various events and services.</p>\n<p>The measure constitutes one of two new A.S. fee initiatives on the ballot this year along with a proposal for a lock-in fee supporting the A.S. weekly newspaper, <i>The Bottom Line</i>. Of the total $1.03 fee, $.71 will go towards the organization, while the remainder will be put towards financial aid and covering administrative fees.</p>\n<p>Lisa Schwartz, a COWSB spokesperson and a current Peer Pre-Health Advisor at the Academic Advising Office, said the goal of the initiative is to gain funding for events that would enrich the physical and mental health of UCSB students.</p>\n<p>“The Associated Students Commission on Student Well Being (COSWB) is committed to the general wellbeing of UCSB undergraduates, with a particular emphasis on mental wellbeing,” Schwartz said. “Its purpose is to increase awareness, educate, and advocate for students. COSWB also creates many programs that provide a positive and comfortable environment for students on campus.”</p>\n<p>COSWB currently holds weekly free fitness class at the UCEN and in Isla Vista, including yoga, Krav Maga, kickboxing and hip-hop dancing. In addition, COSWB hosts events that educate students on healthy eating habits, mental health issues and other health-related topics, Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>“A few weeks ago we had a bounce house. It was amazing to watch the difference in people’s demeanor as they left feeling rejuvenated and refreshed,” Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>Should the fee initiative pass, COSWB’s plan is to expand on the services they already provide for students, according to fourth-year biopsychology major.</p>\n<p>“We plan to lead off campus trips that will be available at no additional charge for students,” Schwartz said. “These events include whale watching, day trips and camping at the Channel Islands, game trucks and additional fitness classes both in IV and on campus.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50917\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50917\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-18/a-s-commission-on-student-well-being-hopes-to-expand-services-with-new-student-lock-in-fee/","id":3070,"author":{"id":37,"name":"Jimmy Chang"},"related":[3069,3068,3067],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/37"}},"__N_SSG":true}
