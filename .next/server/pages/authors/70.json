id=\"caption-attachment-86267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The theater troupe spent weeks before the event tabling in the Arbor and inviting students to attend the show. <em>Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe President, Jalia Carlton-Carew, said auditions and initial preparations for the production began mid-Fall Quarter 2018. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though these pieces are from the ‘90s, they still hold truth because they were still pieces inspired by people’s lived experiences at that time,” Carlton-Carew, a third-year film and media studies major, said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The casting process produced an array of people who could accurately portray the stories in “The Vagina Monologues,” according to Carlton-Carew.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sometimes we have random people who just saw the show, like maybe the year before… I was just so interested after watching the show my first year that I knew I had to be a part of it.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Carlton-Carew handles most of the logistics of the production, she will also be performing a self-written Herstory entitled “When I Was Seven,” in which she discusses her personal experience of black femininity in the U.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s really important culturally for people to be aware of all the topics that we talk about because they play into a wide range of stories… Pieces from the original monologues still relate today,” Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCSB Women’s Ensemble Theatre Troupe Vice President, Kate Rossb, said she was inspired to become part of the production when she first saw the show her freshman year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Ultimately, [the show is] about people. We do target the female experience, but we also target nonbinary folk,” Ross said. “A lot of our pieces reflect cisgender women and trans women — a real variety of people and diverse experiences.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inclusion of a wide range of speakers, characters and actors makes “The Vagina Monologues” and Herstories influential on a college campus such as UCSB, Ross said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a special quality about seeing familiar faces on stage performing, Ross noted, saying that one of the ways in which the monologues succeed is in their ability to portray a spectrum of perspectives through real and relatable people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s easier to distance yourself when it’s someone else’s words coming out of people’s mouths, but when you’re seeing someone up there, telling their story, and they’re your peers or it’s your sister or your friend or your friend’s friend, it definitely connects you more [to the story],” Ross said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The Vagina Monologues” also provide an space for open discussions about current political and social dilemmas. This is one of the most important contributions “The Vagina Monologues” makes to the community, Carlton-Carew said.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have these issues, but we don’t talk about them… I think it’s important to recognize what your peers are still going through even if you don’t see it on the day-to-day.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Given our political climate now, you can’t afford to say something is ‘not your problem,’ even if it doesn’t pertain to you directly because the world is so interconnected. You will feel some impact based on that,” she said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even if you aren’t influenced by people’s stories and what they’re performing, it’s still good to be educated about what other people’s experiences are.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Monologues often deal with issues faced by students at university and reveal insights about students’ experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have these issues, but we don’t talk about them… I think it’s important to recognize what your peers are still going through even if you don’t see it on the day-to-day,” Ross said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After months of preparation and refining, Carew, Ross and the rest of the UCSB Women’s Theatre Troupe will finally showcase the production this weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the show’s earnings will be donated to the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center, an organization that provides confidential counseling and support services to survivors of sexual assault and their loved ones, and the One Billion Rising Campaign, a global movement that aims to end rape and sexual violence against women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In anticipation for the production, Ross is looking forward to finally seeing the pieces come to life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Seeing everyone perform their pieces is really inspiring. It really warms my heart to see how much passion everyone is bringing to their stories.”</span></p>\n<p>Tickets can be purchased at the Associated Students ticket office.</p>\n<p><em>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

I think they’re amazing. They’re diamonds in the rough but diamonds sure enough,” F4Y Executive Director Billi Jo Starr said.</p>\n<p>“It’s about the youth and what they’ve wanted and what they’ve asked for. It’s evolved from a complete bottom-up approach.”</p>\n<p>The campaign will donate 100 percent of the profits from the candles to the camp, according to the campaign’s Facebook page.</p>\n<p>“UCSB and our mentors have been a huge part of that sustainability because of their dedication and their outreach and their ideas, like the Re-Ignite the Light campaign,” Starr said. Most of the F4Y mentors have been personally impacted by juvenile incarceration, she added.</p>\n<p>UCSB F4Y focuses their efforts on helping juveniles while they are incarcerated as well as after they leave, according to Valerie Casillas, UCSB F4Y president.</p>\n<p>“They reach out to us wanting help and we do whatever we can to help them, whether it’s clothes that they need when they get out of camp, helping them look for jobs or career-building,” Casillas said. “We’re here to help every step of the way.”</p>\n<p>An unprecedented partnership between UCSB’s Comparative Literature Department and F4Y emerged when Starr and UCSB CCS professor, Rick Benjamin, co-taught a class titled Literatures of Juvenile Justice.</p>\n<p>Miguel Ramirez, a co-founder of F4Y and previous student of Starr’s outreach at the Camp, has firsthand experience with the struggles of the juvenile justice system and the opportunities of F4Y.</p>\n<p>“In the system, there’s a lot of rehabilitation programs offered for when we’re locked up, and when we get out, they just forget about us. The resources don’t extend to when we’re out and we need the help, suffering from peer pressure or problems at home,” Ramirez said.</p>\n<p>“Freedom 4 Youth was the only program that actually touched base on the outs… [Billi] never really told us to remove ourselves from the gangs. It was more of an outlet to stay away from them and towards positive outreach. It stuck.”</p>\n<p>Dylan Griffith, a returning UCSB student and supervisor of campus mentors, uses his knowledge to further understand the pitfalls of the juvenile justice system.</p>\n<p>“[People] might not think it affects them directly, but their perception of people who are involved in the system or those who are system-impacted, drives their actions potentially more than they understand,” Griffith said.</p>\n<p>Along with the rest of the F4Y team, Griffith, Starr, Ramirez and Casillas participated in fundraisers such as the Re-Ignite the Light campaign and other projects, like creating holiday care packages for women and children in the Santa Barbara County Jail and sending families of incarcerated youth assorted gift cards.</p>\n<p>The care package project was organized by F4Y and was funded by UCSB Community Affairs Board and Associated Students.</p>\n<p>F4Y is also working to influence state policy; they recently visited Sacramento to speak with California state senators about the state’s current sentencing structure.</p>\n<p>All of the outreach, issues and upcoming projects were discussed at an annual F4Y conference held last May, which marked the seventh anniversary of the conference.</p>\n<p>F4Y’s ultimate goal is to both help juveniles resolve their issues and create foundations for their success in the future, Griffith said.</p>\n<p>“We’re not here to just fix problems. We’re here to plant seeds, to empower people to deal with their own lives in whatever way they choose.”</p>\n<p><em>Nyah Scott is a reporter for the </em>Daily Nexus<em> and can be reached at news@dailynexus.com.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Feb. 7, 2019 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

There could be some hesitation. That hesitation could be coming from different places, but to see these types of events is an opportunity to learn more about immigrant experiences,” Diana Ordorica, UCSB’s USS coordinator, said.</p>\n<p>The allyship-based event encouraged attendees to put up posters supporting undocumented students in their workspaces, rooms or social media pages.</p>\n<p>“In the past we’ve had presentations to update folks about what’s going on with immigration. We’ve had trainings for staff, faculty and graduate students,” Ordorica said. This training-oriented experience pursued in the past was once again employed during this year’s Immigration Awareness Week through the second major event of the annual occasion.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 24, a workshop in the Student Resource Building, titled “UndocuQueer and UndocuTrans Safe Zone Training,” promoted a holistic approach to supporting queer and transgender undocumented students. It was open to graduate students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>While partially informational, the workshop also contributed to the visibility of LGBTQIA+ immigrant students through the sharing of stories and experiences from individuals well-acquainted with the struggles of the queer immigration experience.</p>\n<p>“With the current administration that we have, immigration is right at the forefront of everything,” Dwayne Mosbey, RCSGD program coordinator, said. “It’s very important for someone who is working with the LGBTQ community to be working with all of these intersecting communities and these intersecting identities that students may have.”</p>\n<p>With this sentiment in mind, the “UndocuQueer and UndocuTrans” training session featured guest speakers who gave attendees descriptions of firsthand experiences from undocumented, LGBTQIA+ individuals.</p>\n<p>“As progressive as a school UCSB is, I think folks have a lot of presumptions about communities that they’re unfamiliar with, so this is an opportunity for those who are allies to make themselves more well-known for those who aren’t as educated or as well-knowledged about the subject to finally get that kind of information,” Mosbey said.</p>\n<p>According to Mosbey, events like “UndocuQueer and UndocuTrans Safe Zone Training” are meant “to create visibility for students and members of the community who are a part of the undocumented community — for them to feel like folks care about them and that they have clear support here on campus.”</p>\n<p>To conclude Immigration Awareness Week, an open house for UCSB’s Immigration Legal Services was held on Jan. 25 to further highlight the resources available to undocumented immigrant students. The open house, held in the Annex, offered advice from Managing Attorney Vivek Mittal, Attorney Ron Perry and other advisors who make up the Immigration Legal team at UCSB.</p>\n<p>“This week is shining the spotlight for a moment, but it’s — more than anything — igniting a movement to continue on through this year,” Mosbey said.</p>\n<p>“I want folks who are allies or folks who are not as knowledgeable about the subject to come to Immigration Awareness Week, take the information in, analyze within themselves what kind of internalized presumptions they may have, challenge those presumptions and then continue to uplift these communities that have be ingrained in America since its conception.”</p>\n<p><i>Updated [9:56 a.m.]</i></p>\n<p><i>A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.</i></p>\n<p><i>Nyah Scott is a reporter at the Daily Nexus</i><em> and can be reached at news@daliynexus.com.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

California: Long Beach, Mission Viejo, Huntington Beach and now, I.V.</p>\n<p>“[Rockfire Grill is] a fun and safe place for kids to unwind, try some different food that they normally don’t get in the I.V. area and just be in a space to be engaged with the community,” Jai Syal, Rockfire director of marketing and strategy, said.</p>\n<p>“Our burgers come on a fresh-baked flatbread bun, and that bun is baked in the oven after you order it. Our pizzas come on a fresh-baked flatbread as well, but if that’s not your kind of thing, we have wings, salads and other side orders.”</p>\n<p>Syal described Rockfire Grill’s foray into I.V. as “a funny story.”</p>\n<p>“[My younger brother] was living in the building next door, and he was walking to class one day and noticed the space was open for lease,” Syal said.</p>\n<p>“I was visiting him in his new apartment one day, and while I was here, I talked to the landlord, reviewed the lease, built a model and realized that this could be a great opportunity.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_84740\" style=\"width: 1344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-84740\" data-attachment-id=\"84740\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-04/rockfire-rocks-into-isla-vista/img_3089/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?fit=1334%2C750&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1334,750\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_3089\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?fit=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?fit=888%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-84740\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?resize=888%2C499\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?w=1334&amp;ssl=1 1334w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?resize=250%2C141&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_3089.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-84740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rockfire serves burgers, pizzas and salads among other items. <em>Nyah Scott / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After the team finished working out the logistics and staffing, Rockfire Grill came to be.</p>\n<p>The location was <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new-latest-additions-to-isla-vista/\">previously occupied</a> by Rincon Brewery, which closed down over the summer.</p>\n<p>“We have a stage inside for live music and open mic nights,” Syal said.</p>\n<p>“Our whole tagline is ‘Better Buns, Better Burgers.’ Once you feel it and try it for yourself, you’ll know it’s something that’s unique.”</p>\n<p>The restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday and 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=100&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c792fc2b0a61d98a223ae7d52676773?s=200&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-100 photo\" height=\"100\" width=\"100\" itemprop=\"image\"></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://dailynexus.com/author/nyah-scott/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\" itemprop=\"url\"><span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Nyah Scott</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"><p>Nyah Scott is a staff writer for the Daily Nexus.

id=\"caption-attachment-84667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sweet said he has been barred from entering campus. <em>Courtesy of UCSB Faculty Page</em></p></div>\n<p>Sweet’s leave of absence comes after a junior faculty member and an undergraduate summer trainee filed a complaint against him regarding an interaction in July of this year.</p>\n<p>Sweet detailed the interaction and his difficulties dealing with the UCSB administration in a Facebook post on Oct. 13.</p>\n<p>“A junior faculty member got a key to my locked graduate student office room and put one of his off-campus undergraduate summer trainees at the desk of one of my graduate students, displacing her private materials,” Sweet said in the Facebook post.</p>\n<p>Noticing the unlocked office, Sweet requested the undergraduate trainee leave the graduate student’s office.</p>\n<p>“I informed [the junior faculty member] of department policy on secure offices for grad students, and copied my department chair, late afternoon,” Sweet said. “She replied that she’d sort it out, and next morning sent an email telling [the junior faculty member] he was out of line, and that I had responded appropriately.”</p>\n<p>Sweet believed the issue was resolved at the time, but the administration presented a formal charge against him and suspended him approximately two and a half months later.</p>\n<p>According to Sweet’s personal inquiry into the matter, the details of the complaint were not the same as Sweet’s understanding of the encounter.</p>\n<p>Sweet was allegedly told that he “stalked” the female undergraduate trainee, “waited until she was alone” and “harassed and bullied her” before she fled, according to Sweet’s Facebook post.</p>\n<p>“The allegation and all of its add-ons are just flat out false,” he said.</p>\n<p>As of late October, Sweet is unable to access his on-campus office and teach classes.</p>\n<p>In an updated Facebook post on Oct. 24, Sweet said one of his courses is canceled and the other is being taught by a grad student.</p>\n<p>“I think this is an example of how hypersensitivity to sexual harassment can be used unfairly to try to settle scores,” Sweet said. “I don’t know what score is being settled here, but it is causing a lot of disruption, not simply to my good name.”</p>\n<p>“I am aware that former students and scientific colleagues worldwide have reacted with incredulity… UCSB is getting a monstrous black eye over this.”</p>\n<p>UCSB did not offer an official statement regarding Sweet’s case.</p>\n<p>Sweet’s full Facebook post can be viewed <a
