It helps to get here a little early to adapt to the time change and get the jet lag out of our system,” senior guard Kyle Boswell said. “But when it comes to game time we’re going to be ready to play and give 40 minutes of fight. We’ve done it before, so it’s not too big of a disadvantage to come out here.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The Gauchos enter the game with momentum on their side, winning two home contests last week against UC Irvine and UC Davis in impressive and dominating fashion. The victories propelled UCSB back into first place after a weekend, which saw them fall to Cal State Fullerton and narrowly escape UC Riverside in overtime.</p>\n<p>“After the loss to Fullerton it was kind of another wake up for us to realize that if we don’t come ready to play each night, teams that may not have the best record can easily come out here and beat us,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Leading the Gauchos with a pair of monster performances last weekend was junior center Alan Williams. The big man garnered his fourth Big West Player of the Week Award this season after he averaged 26.5 points, 15 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 1.5 blocks in the two victories.</p>\n<p>Also of importance was the emotional return of sophomore guard John Green on Saturday against Davis. Green played in his first regular season game as a Gaucho after injuries derailed his collegiate career over the past three years. It will certainly be of interest to see how Green progresses and emerges into Santa Barbara’s rotation of wing players including Boswell, sophomore guard Michael Bryson and sophomore forward Taran Brown.</p>\n<p>With a return to health for the majority of its lineup and riding two important conference victories, the Gauchos are certainly poised to continue their run as a contender in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It was nice to come out last week and get two solid wins,” Boswell said. “It definitely gives us momentum, and we feel like we can compete with any team in the conference and that we’re the best team in the conference.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s matchup will certainly challenge the Gauchos, however, as the Rainbow Warriors are victorious in four of their past five games. Hawaii boasts an impressive 11-3 home record and leads the conference in scoring with over 82 points per game, over eight points better than the second ranked team.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be a tough game. They got some solid wins in the preseason and they have a lot of talent on their team,” Boswell said. “They’ve got some guards that are really quick and can push the tempo and they’ve also got some big guys that are a force to be reckoned with down low. We’ve just got to come out with a lot of energy like we have the last few games and play hard and let the game come to us.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Christian Standhardinger leads Hawaii in points (17.6) and rebounds (7.6) per game, ranking third and fifth in the conference, respectively. The Rainbow Warriors also tout sophomore forward Isaac Fotu, last season’s Big West Co-Freshman of the Year. Fotu ranks in the top 10 of the conference in both points and rebounds. Junior guard Garrett Nevels also places in the top 10 in Big West scoring, giving the Rainbow Warriors three top scorers.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be really difficult; Standhardinger is an awesome player. He gets to the foul line and is one of the best in our league,” Boswell said. “He’s a force in terms of driving to the basket and creating contact. You can’t completely eliminate a factor like him but if we can keep him contained, and make him work for his points and don’t give him second chance opportunities … I think we’ll have a pretty good shot at taking down the Warriors.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Hawaii is scheduled for 7 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of Feb. 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53891\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53891\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-06/battle-of-the-beach-schools/","id":570,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[569,568,567],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Surge to First Place After Pair of Wins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.1.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCD-4_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.1.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.UCD-4_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB came up big with home victories against UC Irvine and UC Davis this weekend.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There were a number of prominent storylines this weekend for the UCSB men’s basketball team, ranging from a pair of decisive victories to junior center Alan Williams’ usual dominance down low.

Williams was a big reason Santa Barbara moved into first place with a 14-6 overall record and 5-2 mark in the Big West. Davis now stands at 7-15 overall and 2-5 in the conference.</p>\n<p>“I love the fact that he got 20 and 20. It says something about a guy if he can go get 20 and 20 in a game,” Coach Williams said. “That doesn’t happen very often. He’s already getting a lot of national attention but you get 20 and 20, that’s a feat.”</p>\n<p>Williams finished the first half with 10 points and 12 rebounds and followed that up with a 17-point, eight rebound performance in the second half. Big Al also finished the game with four assists and two blocked shots.</p>\n<p>“We go to him every game to see who can stop him because I don’t think anyone in division I basketball can stop him,” freshman point guard Eric Childress said.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 15 points on 3-5 shooting from beyond the arc, becoming only the third Gaucho to make 200 career three-pointers in the process.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 11 points for UCSB, while Childress added eight points and three assists. This game was never in question as the Gauchos outrebounded Davis by a margin of 14 and outshot the Aggies in both field goal and three-point percentage.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident that we can run this conference and really be the number one team to win that Big West Championship,” Green said. “Once we have the opportunity to meet these two teams that we lost to [we’re confident] that we’re going to handle business.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s contest against UC Irvine began the weekend on a high note for the Gauchos, as they stomped the Anteaters in an 80-60 victory.

The Gauchos will attempt to rebound from the loss when they return home, where they are 5-2 on the season.</p>\n<p>Irvine, meanwhile, had a six-game winning streak snapped when they fell to Hawaii on Saturday for its first and only conference loss so far this season.</p>\n<p>An interesting matchup to watch in this game will be UCSB junior center Alan Williams against Irvine freshman center Mamadou Ndiaye. The 6’7” Williams ranks first in the Big West with 22.9 points and 10.6 rebounds, and is second in blocks at 2.4 per game. Ndiaye, however, is an imposing 7’6”, the tallest player in the nation, and leads the conference with 3.4 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>It will certainly be interesting to see how much of a defensive impact Ndiaye will have on Big Al, the seventh leading scorer in the nation.</p>\n<p>“Al will be fine against him. Al will be able to score. [Ndiaye] really affects the game, he’s huge. We’ve never played against anything like him, nobody has,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “At the same time he scores nine points a game. His biggest effect on the game is on the defensive end, he’s tremendously effective down there at taking away the rim. Al might have to hit jumpers but I think Al will find ways to be productive.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, the Anteaters are dangerous and versatile, ranking second in the conference averaging over 75 points per game. Senior guard Chris McNealy leads Irvine with over 12 points per game, while junior forward Will Davis II and freshman guard Luke Nelson each average just above 11 per game. Ndiaye along with sophomore guard Alex Young score above nine points per game to give the Anteaters a reliable starting five.</p>\n<p>Irvine also ranks first in the conference in rebounds pulling down nearly 40 boards per game, while placing atop the Big West with a 48.5 field goal percentage. Ndiaye and Davis II each average just above six rebounds per game to lead the Anteaters.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very good rebounding team, they have a plus-six average on the year rebounding-wise, which is a big number in college basketball. And that is not just Mamadou,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly will not go down without a fight, especially in front of a home crowd that has come out to support in recent games. In the last two home games, the attendance at the Thunderdome has averaged more than 4,500 fans per game.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can make this place really tough for opponents to come into. That’s our main goal: to get as many students out here as we possibly can,” Big Al said. “Every game is important when you get into conference, especially home games. You’ve got to win as many home games as you possibly can, and this one’s really important, so we’ve got to get it.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the key number for the Gauchos seems to be 70. UCSB is 11-0 when they allow 70 points of fewer and 1-6 when allowing 70 or more. In order to defeat first-place Irvine, Santa Barbara will need to keep Irvine’s numerous offensive weapons in check.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will respond to Irvine with a trio of wing players who have supported Big Al from the perimeter. Brown along with sophomore guard Michael Bryson and senior guard Kyle Boswell have been impressive from three-point land this season, with the latter two each ranking in the top six in three-point percentage in the Big West. Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon has helped facilitate the scoring with a conference best 5.2 assists per game and a 3.6 assist to turnover ratio which ranks sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>“They’ve got a good team. But it’s not a better basketball team than Cal, [and] it’s not a better basketball team than us. We’ve got to show up and play,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January  30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53783\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53783\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-30/taking-on-the-best-of-the-big-west/","id":555,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[554,553,552],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Thug is No Way to Describe Richard Sherman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/richardsherman.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/richardsherman.png?resize=661%2C492&ssl=1","description":"Critics have been wrong to call Richard Sherman a thug.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>If you haven’t heard the name Richard Sherman, maybe it’s time you read some headlines once in a while. The talented Seattle Seahawks cornerback has emerged as one of the most popular yet polarizing figures in the game of football thanks in large part to his postgame rant after the NFC Championship game. In case you need a refresher, Sherman yelled on camera, criticizing 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree and proclaiming himself the best cornerback in the game. Within minutes, Sherman was trending on Twitter, and he immediately became a national sensation.</p>\n<p>Sherman’s actions have received much criticism, both online and in the media, and rightfully so. His behavior showed poor sportsmanship and took away from what truly should have mattered — his teammates and the team victory. Instead, Sherman took the spotlight to belittle an opposing player who he had just trumped on national television, causing media and fans across the nation to focus more so on his antics rather than the Seahawks advancing to the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>But the way in which many have responded to Sherman is troubling and brings up an interesting and disturbing discussion. Many people, particularly online, resorted to calling Sherman a “thug,” a word with an extremely negative connotation. Is Sherman a loudmouth? Sure. Can he be described as cocky and at times arrogant? I wouldn’t argue against it. However, calling Sherman a thug and making him a villain out of a mishandled interview is certainly now way to him.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Sherman came from the poor neighborhood of Compton, worked hard in high school to graduate as the Salutatorian with a 4.2 GPA and received a scholarship to play football at Stanford. Once at Stanford, Sherman continued to excel, graduating with a 3.9 GPA and a degree in Communication while balancing football and a spot in the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. He is also working towards a Master’s degree from Stanford.</p>\n<p>In addition to his academic excellence, Sherman is a generous and philanthropic man, often visiting underprivileged schools and providing students and athletes with the necessary resources that are often taken for granted in the classroom and on the field. Sherman even went as far as signing a contract with students, stipulating that if they were good students and members of the community, he would continue to provide them with classroom materials.</p>\n<p>A Stanford-educated man who has no criminal history and has shown a knack for helping children and the underprivileged certainly does not sound like a thug to me. Whether it is racism or even poor judgment and word choice on the behalf of critics, a thug is no way to describe Richard Sherman.</p>\n<p>His antics are over the top at times, but that, along with his talent on the field are what make him such a popular player. Sherman is the only defensive player in the top-10 of NFL jersey sales, and those numbers have skyrocketed in the past month.</p>\n<p>As far as his claim to be the best cornerback in the game — I’d have to agree with Sherman. The last two years he has been named All-Pro first team, registering eight interceptions in each season, a league high this year. In only three seasons of play, Sherman has registered 20 career interceptions. Not bad for a player who switched from wide receiver to cornerback in his final year at Stanford.</p>\n<p>A fifth round pick in the NFL draft by Seattle, Sherman has excelled in life every step of the way in the face of tremendous opposition. If you’ve ever heard him speak, aside from the notorious NFC Championship Game interview, you’d know Sherman is an intelligent and well-spoken man.</p>\n<p>Sherman’s actions have certainly garnered him more haters, but with that come more and more fans as well. When examining Sherman for the man he is on and off the field, and not only judging him on the one instance of poor behavior, it is hard to justify the hate. I am surprised to admit to myself that I am a Richard Sherman fan, something I never thought I’d say.</p>\n<p>You can be sure he’ll be in the spotlight come Sunday and all eyes will be on him and his actions during and after the game. Sherman is no villain, just a fiery competitor. Best of luck to you, Richard, this Super Bowl Sunday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 29, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Amy Chase of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53757\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53757\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-29/thug-is-no-way-to-describe-richard-sherman/","id":3249,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3248,3247,3246],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Splits Pair of Weekend Road Games","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.16.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-9-peter-vanndenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1.16.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-9-peter-vanndenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeated Riverside Thursday night before falling to Cal State Fullerton in a televised contest.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The ability to close out games has become an area of concern for the UCSB men’s basketball team as the Gauchos finished this weekend with a 1-1 mark. UCSB defeated UC Riverside Thursday in overtime despite giving up a 17-point second half lead before falling Saturday night to Cal State Fullerton in a failed comeback attempt.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara defeated Riverside 68-65 on Thursday and fell to Fullerton 74-72 in a televised game Saturday night, bringing its record to 12-6 overall and 3-2 in the Big West. Saturday’s loss snapped a three-game winning streak for the Gauchos, placing them in a three-way tie for third place in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>In a game televised on Fox Sports Prime Ticket, UCSB came out flat on Saturday, trailing by as many as 12 points in the second half. The Gauchos rallied, however, primarily behind the play of junior center Alan Williams. Big Al recorded 16 of his 26 points in the second half, adding along nine rebounds, two steals and two blocks in the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>With 2:20 remaining in the contest, UCSB took its first and only lead of the game at 70-68 when Big Al converted a three-point play.

Santa Barbara was forced to foul and Fullerton made the first of two free throws before missing the second.</p>\n<p>Off the missed free throw, the Gauchos pushed the ball up the court to freshman guard Eric Childress who missed a contested layup with 12 seconds remaining. UCSB was once again forced to foul, leading to two Titan free throws that put the game out of reach for the Gauchos. Fullerton improved to 7-12 overall and 2-3 in the Big West with the victory.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Alex Harris led the Titans with 22 points, while Michael Williams added 19 points, six rebounds and eight assists in a game-high 38 minutes of play.

Boswell added 11 points off the bench, finishing the game 3-7 in three-point shooting.</p>\n<p>While UCSB came out slow in the first half on Saturday, Thursday’s contest against Riverside was the exact opposite. The Gauchos rushed out to an 11-point halftime lead, building that margin to 17 points within the first two minutes of the second half.</p>\n<p>Riverside slowly chipped away at the lead, however, using two separate 8-0 runs to tie the game at 50 with 8:23 remaining in the game. UCSB built a 60-54 lead with just over two minutes remaining, but the Highlanders rallied once again, closing the half on a 6-0 run.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Taylor Johns was fouled with five seconds remaining and his Riverside team trailing 60-59. With a chance to give the Highlanders a late-game lead, Johns made the first free throw but missed the second, avoiding what could have been an epic collapse for UCSB.</p>\n<p>In the overtime period, six of the eight points UCSB scored came by the way of free throws. Bryson scored the final four points of the game for Santa Barbara, an impressive feat considering he had all of one point scored in regulation.</p>\n<p>With a chance to tie the game, Riverside freshman guard Sam Finley missed a three-point jumper with one second remaining to secure the 68-65 win for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Big Al led UCSB with 21 points and seven rebounds, while Harmon and sophomore forward Mitch Brewe added 11 points. Boswell added 10 points off the bench for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Chris Patton led Riverside with 23 points behind an impressive 10-13 night shooting. Finley added 20 points and Johns pitched in with nine points and 11 rebounds for the Highlanders. Including a Saturday victory over Cal Poly, Riverside now holds a 7-13 record and a 2-4 mark in the Big West.</p>\n<p>UCSB next faces UC Irvine Thursday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of January 27, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53711\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53711\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-27/ucsb-splits-pair-of-weekend-road-games/","id":551,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[550,549,548],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Riding the Momentum","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/BBALL-cover-photo-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/BBALL-cover-photo-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Travels To UC Riverside Having Won Eight of its Last 10 Games","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Heading into this weekend’s road games, the UCSB men’s basketball team has already matched last season’s win total and has won eight of its last 10 games.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will look to continue a stretch of solid play when they travel to face UC Riverside on Thursday and Cal State Fullerton Saturday in a televised contest.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the backend of a three-game road trip with an 11-5 overall record and 2-1 mark in Big West play.

We saw the problem when it was just Al in a game where everybody else just couldn’t seem to get it going,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “It’s a group conversation about how we need to get other people involved, we need other people to step up, make plays, be aggressive, and I think we did a much better job of that the last two games.”</p>\n<p>When scouting Riverside, Big Al and the rest of the UCSB big men will certainly face a tough matchup against sophomore Taylor Johns. The 6’7” forward leads Riverside in points at 12.8 per game while ranking third in the conference in rebounds (8.2) and blocks per game (1.9).</p>\n<p>“I make it a mission to stop whoever I’m matched up against,” Brewe said. “If I am matched up against Riverside’s big guy, it’s going to be my personal mission. I know it’s Al’s mission and Sam’s mission to really stop him and keep him contained. That’s going to be part of the game plan, and we feel like we have the physical presence and the ability to do so.”</p>\n<p>The Highlanders have lost four of their last five games, the lone victory being an 81-69 comeback win over UC Davis. UCSB split the season series with Riverside last season with each team winning on its home floor.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we’re not going to overlook them. We need to be edgy, and we’ve already lost a home game — that puts you in a little bit of a hole,” Coach Williams said. “We need to win as many road contests as possible. You want to be in the championship hunt, it’s about how many road games can you win, and we need to make sure we take advantage of any opportunity we have on the road.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton, meanwhile, has also lost four of its last five contests with the only victory coming in a 78-73 home contest against Riverside. The Gauchos also split last year’s contest against the Titans, winning at home and falling on the road.</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Riverside on Thursday is scheduled for 7 p.m., while Saturday’s contest at Fullerton is set for a 7:30 p.m. start on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of January 23rd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53653\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53653\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-23/gauchos-riding-the-momentum/","id":554,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[553,552,551],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Two Gauchos Selected in MLS SuperDraft","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fifi-Baiden_for-01.22_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fifi-Baiden_for-01.22_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Peter Schmetz and Fifi Baiden were selected in back-t0-back picks in the third round of the 2014 MLS SuperDraft on Tuesday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In case anyone does not already know, UCSB is a powerhouse when it comes to men’s collegiate soccer.

This season, Schmetz garnered All-Big West First Team honors despite missing the final five games of the season with injury.</p>\n<p>Schmetz was named College Sports Madness Defender of the Year for the Big West. He was sidelined for most of the 2012 season, but was named All-Big West Honorable Mention in 2011 during his first year at UCSB after transferring from Westmont.</p>\n<p>Baiden was born in Ghana, coming to California for high school where he caught the eye of UCSB. During his junior season, Baiden garnered All-Big West First Team honors and was selected to the All-Big West Second Team during his senior season.</p>\n<p>Despite his 5’8” stature, Baiden played in 78 matches during his four years at UCSB, earning him recognition as the 38th ranked player in Top Drawer Soccer’s 2013 Top-100 College Players list.</p>\n<p>“These are pretty high draft picks. Both of these clubs are making an investment in these two players,” UCSB Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The goal is not to get drafted, but to make the team. It’s a good start for them but now they’ve got work to do to make the squad.”</p>\n<p>The duo joins a long list of Gauchos who have gone on to play professionally as 27 UCSB players were drafted by the MLS since 2004.</p>\n<p>“That’s why I went to UCSB from the beginning because it’s such a great soccer environment. We have such a great stadium, we have such a great community, we have so many fans at our games, it’s almost already like playing professionally,” Schmetz said. “It’s a great school as well, so it’s just the perfect fit. It just gets you ready to go to the next level.”</p>\n<p>Baiden and Schmetz will not have long to celebrate their most recent achievements as both leave Santa Barbara with degrees already in hand. Baiden leaves Thursday to Columbus to complete a physical before traveling with the team for preseason training in Florida on Saturday morning. Schmetz will arrive in Kansas City on Friday for a physical and depart with the team for Tucson, Arizona where preseason training will begin Saturday.</p>\n<p>“Both of them have been training on their own hoping to get this opportunity,” Vom Steeg said. “These are two players who have always worked hard during their time at UCSB, and hopefully things fall in place for them.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 22, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53631\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53631\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-22/two-gauchos-selected-in-mls-superdraft/","id":1571,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1570,1569,1568],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Long Beach State in ESPN Televised Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB snapped a five-game losing streak to Long Beach State on Thursday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It had been three seasons and five straight games that Long Beach State had UCSB’s number.

The Gauchos held Long Beach to under 30 percent shooting on the night and came out victorious despite committing 19 turnovers.</p>\n<p>“It was important for us to get a win at home. We feel like we shouldn’t lose at home in league for the rest of this year,” sophomore forward Mitch Brewe said. “It was tough coming off Cal Poly, we were lackadaisical and it was a tough game. But we rallied around the crowd, our teammates and coaching staff, and we really came out ready to defend our home court.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach opened the game with a quick 12-6 lead before UCSB responded with an 11-0 run powered by five straight points from sophomore guard Michael Bryson. The Gauchos would lead for the remainder of the half until Long Beach took a brief 22-21 lead with under four minutes left in the half. Tied at 24 and with the final possession, freshman point guard Eric Childress made a brilliant pass to sophomore forward Sam Beeler who slammed the ball home a second before the halftime buzzer to give UCSB a 26-24 lead at the break.</p>\n<p>A quick 9-0 start to the second half stretched the Gaucho lead and UCSB continued to push the 49ers, eventually building a 50-31 lead with just under nine minutes remaining in the contest. Long Beach would rally to as close as eight points with over four minutes left to play by forcing numerous turnovers, but the Gauchos quickly shut the door on any comeback hopes.</p>\n<p>Bryson twice drove baseline and dunked the ball over Long Beach defenders, sandwiching a Sportscenter worthy dunk by sophomore forward Taran Brown that put the game away for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“I was really happy with the fact that there was some aggressive straight line drives by Michael and Taran, that [Zalmico] was more aggressive,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “[I was happy] everybody else on the team felt the need to step up and be more of a weapon offensively because we put too much on pressure on Al when we don’t.”</p>\n<p>Junior center Alan Williams who entered the game third in the nation averaging over 24 points per game was held to 12 points in the contest, his second fewest this season. Despite Williams’s lack of scoring, the big man still managed to pull down 15 rebounds, improving his pre-game average of 11.1 per game which ranked sixth in the nation.</p>\n<p>Bryson finished the contest with a team-high 13 points to go along with nine rebounds for the Gauchos. Brewe, meanwhile, registered a career-high 12 points and finished 2-2 from behind the three-point line, a recent addition to the power forward’s game.</p>\n<p>“It was important that we had other players make plays,” Coach Williams said. “I think what Long Beach watched was the Cal Poly game where other players didn’t make plays and Al had to carry the load with 33 and 15. What I liked best is Al only gets 12 tonight but he has 15 rebounds again. He stayed after it.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was certainly a factor in this game as junior guard Zalmico Harmon scored seven points to go along with a game-high nine assists for the Gauchos. Long Beach junior point guard Michael Caffey led the team with 21 points but his impact was matched by Harmon’s intensity on the floor.</p>\n<p>“I thought Z was very aggressive and we addressed that and asked him to raise his aggression level. Z has been good as an assist to turnover guy on the year,” Coach Williams said. “For us, the idea that Z was aggressive, that Z scored seven points and gets nine assists, those are good numbers.”</p>\n<p>Junior guard Kyle Boswell finished with eight points and shot 2-5 from behind the arc, while Brown scored six points and pulled down four rebounds.</p>\n<p>Despite turning the ball over 12 more times than Long Beach, the Gauchos were efficient with the shot opportunities they had, shooting over 50 percent for the game and 40 percent from the three.</p>\n<p>Long Beach finished 5-27 from three-point land as only one 49er finished the game in double-digit scoring. The 49ers struggled against Santa Barbara’s zone defense as the Gauchos closed down on shooters and forced Long Beach to take plenty of contested outside jumpers.</p>\n<p>“The zone really affected them. The rotations we’ve been working on constantly in practice really came into play in that game,” Brewe said. “And you won’t see a Long Beach team shoot 30 percent very often.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s victory ended a three-game homestand for UCSB in which the Gauchos twice saw large crowds support the team. UCSB will miss the comforts of the Thunderdome as it now embarks on a three-game road trip.</p>\n<p>“It was good for the fans too because they always show great support,” Harmon said. “It was good to get them a win, and get everybody back in the swing of things and show everybody we are the team that we know we are.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face Cal State Northridge on Saturday for a 7:30 p.m. contest that will be televised live on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53603\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53603\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-17/53603/","id":578,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[577,576,575],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Rival Long Beach State in Televised Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Brock_BBall_1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Brock_BBall_1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB hosts Long Beach State at 8 p.m. on ESPNU.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Crowded stands are becoming a regular sight at the Thunderdome for the UCSB men’s basketball team this season.

If we play with an edge we’re a really good team so that’s our message of the week,” junior center Alan Williams said. “It should be a good energy again. Hopefully we can get a crowd out here again and have everybody we had at the last game come back, and hopefully we can play with that edge that we’re known for.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Big Al paced UCSB with 33 points and 15 rebounds in Saturday’s loss to Cal Poly, but sloppy defense and the inability to hit the outside shot negated Big Al’s outstanding performance. The big man is certainly motivated not to let the Gauchos lose a second straight game in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“I know it’s definitely important for me; I haven’t beat them yet so it’d be good to get that first win over Long Beach,” Big Al said. “It’s always been a big rivalry: they’ve always been known to play us really tough and us to play them really tough in return. It should be a lot of exciting play on Thursday.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach enters the contest with a 5-11 overall record and 1-1 mark in conference play. The 49ers began Big West play with a narrow loss to UC Irvine on Thursday before handily beating UC Davis on Saturday. Despite sporting a losing record, Long Beach has faced a number of good teams this season, possessing the second strongest non-conference schedule in the nation.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great game. Long Beach is a good team. They’ve played a lot of good teams this year,” sophomore guard Michael Bryson said. “Their record doesn’t show how good they are but we know what we need to do coming into this game and we’re going to make sure we come out of this game with a 1-1 record.”</p>\n<p>Bryson will face a tough test defensively as he will match up against junior guard Tyler Lamb, a transfer from UCLA in his first year with Long Beach, who has averaged over 18 points per game in his six games of play since becoming eligible in late December.</p>\n<p>Other Long Beach players to watch will be junior guard Michael Caffey and senior forward Dan Jennings. Caffey is sixth in the conference averaging 16 points per game, while Jennings is fourth in rebounds with 7.5 boards per game. UCSB junior point guard Zalmico Harmon and Big Al will each face tough assignments against Caffey and Jennings.</p>\n<p>“I think [Harmon is] ready to play against Caffey. I think Caffey is a very good player, he does an excellent job,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They also have Jennings who is a great center and Tyler Lamb is one of the best wings in the league. We think Long Beach is one of the top teams in league.”</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to rebound from Saturday’s loss they will need Bryson along with sophomore forward Taran Brown and senior guard Kyle Boswell to hit outside shots. UCSB shot 2-17 in the loss to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“We put it behind us. We’re a team that we know we can shoot,” Bryson said. “We know that if we get inside to Al and he throws outside to us, he knows we’re going to knock it down for him. We just need to keep the same confidence.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has not defeated the 49ers since the 2011 Big West Tournament Championship Game, which sent the Gauchos to the NCAA Tournament. Fans can be sure the Gauchos will bring their A-game on Thursday in hopes of playing in front of another large crowd and a television audience.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s vital [when fans show up], especially for a lot of guys, it just gives something to play for and a lot more energy in the crowd so that we don’t have to produce it ourselves,” Big Al said. “We’re going to come out and play with our own intensity and our own energy, but it always helps to have the crowd’s energy and support behind you.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s game against rival Long Beach State is scheduled for 8 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPNU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of January 16, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53568\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53568\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-16/ucsb-hosts-rival-long-beach-state-in-televised-game/","id":577,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[576,575,574],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Everyone Looks Up to These Gauchos … Literally","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Nexus Sports Sits Down With the Big Men of the UCSB Men’s Basketball Team","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>I had the chance to sit with Sam Beeler, Alan Williams and Mitch Brewe yesterday at practice and got to know them a little better.

It’s challenging enough for it to be difficult, but it’s also easygoing enough for you to have a good time and enjoy your college experience.</p>\n<p>Brewe: The people know how to have a good time but still are smart and kick ass in school. Which is crazy because it’s such a good academic university even though it’s Isla Vista and all that crazy stuff going on … ­­to still be academically focused, that’s pretty cool too. And the beach, too! It’s awesome being around the beach.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Has there been a funny incident or something unusual that happens to you because you’re tall?</strong></p>\n<p>Brewe: I ride my long board everywhere and this tiny Asian girl riding her long board got so indecisive when she saw me coming, she just totally bailed out and fell into the grass and I was literally like five feet away from her and not going to hit her whatsoever. She literally just tumbled into the grass with her backpack and everybody was like, “What just happened?” I think I kind of intimidated her off her skateboard a little bit.</p>\n<p>Williams: Spider webs suck when you’re big and tall. Another thing is when you walk around, everybody looks up at you and stares in awe. You just get a whole bunch of crazy looks all the time.</p>\n<p>Beeler: My shower at home is terrible. I bend down in it all the time and I end up just sitting in it. The most common thing is I’ll be sitting in class next to someone, and I’ve already been sitting in there prior to them coming in, so we’re just talking or whatever and class ends and I get up and they’re like, “Oh my God, like, you’re huge. I didn’t realize it when you were sitting down.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do people usually ask you about your height?</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Williams: Everybody asks me, “Can I ask you a question?” It’s just like, yeah of course, I already know what you’re going to ask: “How tall am I?” So, you just tell them, “6’8”.” And they’re like, “Oh my God, that’s so tall.” They ask us how tall we are all the time. You should see Sam in airports, it’s ridiculous. Sam in an airport gathers so much attention because he’s 6’11”. He’s just huge and everybody will ask him how tall he is.</p>\n<p>Beeler: And then it’s all the jokes that you’ve heard before too. I know some people get offended by it or whatever, but for me I just try to be nice about it. I’m so used to it at this point it doesn’t even bother me. It’s just another thing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What’s your favorite part about being a basketball player?</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: I’d say it’s the travel for me. I’ve been so many places thanks to just playing basketball in general; just places I’d never imagined going. Sometimes it’s a bad thing that I’m in the middle of nowhere, Northern Illinois or something like that. A lot of times you get to go to a lot of places like Hawaii, Seattle, Salt Lake (City), Louisiana. It’s awesome to be able to experience that, especially with people that you actually like being around too.</p>\n<p>Brewe: This is going to be corny, but I kind of like representing the school, like being a part of something bigger, you know. Being a part of the university and being kind of a face of the university, and hopefully we can set a good example and be a good part of the legacy here. I think that’s pretty cool.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Is it tough balancing being a normal college student while being a student athlete?</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: There’s no “normal” being a college student when you’re an athlete because it’s just so time-consuming. But you get to do the simple stuff sometimes. It’s good when you have a couple days off and you can relax and go to the beach or relax and go hang out with your friends. But a lot of times our focus is always on getting better every day. We spend countless hours shooting in the gym or lifting and stuff like that. In everything we do, we try to incorporate how it’s going to make us a better player, and if that means we can go and hang out on the side, that’s a good thing. We put our sports and our academics first all the time.</p>\n<p>Beeler: That’s the thing about being a student athlete; you have to figure out the balance and time management, that’s a big thing.</p>\n<p>Williams: Mitch is like a super smart, A-plus student so he can tell you all about that.</p>\n<p>Brewe: Finding the time for homework is the hardest. You get home from practice and you just want to lie in your bed and not do a thing. I just want to sleep. But you have to get home and you have to be like, “In 10 minutes I’m going to open this damn book and I’m going to read.” Really just committing yourself is pretty tough. Like these guys said, it’s time consuming but I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Do you guys ever get a chance to go out on DP and do you go as a team?</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: All the time, definitely. We hang out a lot, especially on the weekends when we get a couple of days off if we don’t have practice the next day we’ll go out and enjoy ourselves out there. But we always know there are consequences with doing that kind of stuff. We’re seen as, like you said, someone other than just a normal college student and whatever we do represents our team and our university in either a positive or negative way. When we’re out there, we do it in a smart way and we’re always safe.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tell UCSB students why they should come out and watch you play Long Beach on Thursday.</strong></p>\n<p>Williams: It’s fun; it’s a great energy. You see a fast-paced kind of sport. We’re up and down, we’re dunking the ball and three-point shots ­­­— all that kind of stuff. It’s a lot of intensity and it’s a lot of tradition that goes into UCSB basketball. We put in a lot of hard work for this university, so it’d be great to have them come out and support us.</p>\n<p>Beeler: It’s fun for us when we get big crowds like that and hopefully it’s fun for them to come and be a big crowd. We’re super grateful for the people who do come out and it’s just awesome when they do.</p>\n<p>Williams: And it’s on TV too. Be on SportsCenter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 15th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53531\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53531\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-15/everyone-looks-up-to-these-gauchos-literally/","id":576,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[575,574,573],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Rival Poly in League Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bballvscalpoly_annakodelashvili_1.11.14.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bballvscalpoly_annakodelashvili_1.11.14.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos lose 72-64 in Big West opener to Cal Poly","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With a season-high 5,982 fans in attendance for the Blue-Green rivalry game, the Thunderdome was rocking Saturday in anticipation of the start of Big West play for the UCSB men’s basketball team. Unfortunately, fans left disappointed as the Gauchos fell 72-64, unable to finish a late-game rally from a double-digit deficit.</p>\n<p>Despite a monstrous performance from junior center Alan Williams, the Gauchos fell short in their conference opener, dropping the team to 9-5 on the season and 0-1 in the Big West. Cal Poly, who was victorious in the Thunderdome for the first time since 2007, improves to 6-9 overall and 2-0 in conference.</p>\n<p>“The crowd did their job and we just didn’t do ours. They were out here cheering us on and we didn’t perform for them,” Williams said. “It’s on us; there’s nobody to blame except the guys in the locker room. We’ve just got to be better ­— it’s a long conference season and we’ve got 15 more games to fix this.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Santa Barbara opened the rivalry game flat, trailing 28-24 at the half, and did not respond much better in the second half, falling behind by 12 in the early minutes after the break. The Gauchos rallied to as close as three but could never get over the hump, often failing to hit clutch shots and opting for three-pointers instead of the steady inside presence of Williams.</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a guy that they can’t handle, you keep going to him,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We didn’t have the discipline tonight where we’ve had that discipline in many games. We didn’t make Cal Poly make a decision.”</p>\n<p>UCSB shot 2-17 from the three-point line, whereas Cal Poly finished 11-18 from behind the arc, proving to be the major difference in the game.</p>\n<p>The only story for UCSB in this game was Big Al’s 33-point, 15-rebound performance. Williams scored 22 for UCSB in the second half and was one of only two Gauchos to score in double figures, the other being junior point guard Zalmico Harmon with 10 points.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly played very well, and we didn’t respond,” Coach Williams said. “I thought Al showed up, but I don’t think anybody else showed up and responded.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs received much of their scoring from unlikely sources in this game. Junior forward Anthony Silvestri finished with a team-high 17 points, going 5-7 from behind the arc despite his season average of under four points scored per game. Another bench player in freshman guard Taylor Sutlive added 11 points on 3-4 shooting from the three. Together, the duo provided dagger after dagger towards Santa Barbara’s hopes of climbing back in the game.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t contest, we didn’t listen and we didn’t switch or pay attention to the good shooters,” Harmon said. “No offense to them, they’re a great team, but we let two guys who’d come off the bench come in and light us up off of miscommunication and not knowing personnel.”</p>\n<p>Opening conference play with a loss, especially at the hands of a rival, was a major disappointment for the Gauchos considering how well they played in the non-conference portion of the schedule.</p>\n<p>“It happens, we hate that it happens, it shouldn’t happen, but tonight it happened. It’s time for some reflection,” Big Al said. “We’ve got to look ourselves in the mirror and see what we did wrong and fix all the things that we need to fix. It’s a long season, we’ve just got to get back in practice and do better and get our focus back.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 13th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna Kodelashvili of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53497\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53497\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-13/ucsb-falls-to-rival-poly-in-league-opener/","id":574,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[573,572,571],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Rival Cal Poly to Open Conference Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-8.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-8.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB opens Big West play against rival Cal Poly.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Arguably the most talented squad in the Big West, the UCSB men’s basketball team embarks on a three-month journey to showcase its skill as it begins conference play on Saturday.

The Gauchos are ranked No. 14 in the Mid-Major Top-25 poll and maintain a No. 39 RPI ranking according to ESPN</p>\n<p>Much of Santa Barbara’s success comes with the superb play of junior center Alan Williams, who ranks fourth in the nation in scoring at 23.5 points per game, 12th in rebounds at 10.7 per game, and 37th in blocks with 2.64 per game.</p>\n<p>“Big Al, he’s just a great talent, a skill player. Practically from everyone I’ve seen in the nation he’s pretty unstoppable,” Harmon said. “It’s a great asset having him. Maybe the best in the nation as far as a passer and scorer out of the post.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos have had a long week of practice and rest in preparation for the Mustangs. UCSB last defeated The Master’s College 81-52 on Jan. 4, but Saturday’s game will provide much stiffer competition.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly began conference play with a 77-65 victory over Hawaii at home improving the Mustangs to 5-9 overall and 1-0 in the Big West. Despite finishing the non-conference portion of the schedule with a 4-9 record, Cal Poly certainly will come to play against its rival. The Mustangs faced the 25th toughest non-conference schedule and is certainly tested enough for conference play.</p>\n<p>“They’re a very physical team and their preseason doesn’t really reflect their actual performance,” Harmon said. “We just need to come and bring it every second because they’re going to come out as if we we’re the number one team in the nation and we’re going to come out as if they were [the number one team]. It’s going to be a very physical and hard fought game.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s contest against rival Cal Poly is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Daily Nexus <em>File Photo</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53487\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-11/ucsb-hosts-rival-cal-poly-to-open-conference-play/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53487\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-11/ucsb-hosts-rival-cal-poly-to-open-conference-play/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-11/ucsb-hosts-rival-cal-poly-to-open-conference-play/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-11/ucsb-hosts-rival-cal-poly-to-open-conference-play/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-11/ucsb-hosts-rival-cal-poly-to-open-conference-play/","id":567,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[566,565,564],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Previews: UCSB Men’s Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/FRONT-PAGE-12.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-Cal-8.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/FRONT-PAGE-12.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-Cal-8.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB men's basketball is one of the favorites to win the Big West this season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>What a difference one year can make. Last season, the UCSB men’s basketball team struggled for much of the year, hampered by injuries to the third-youngest roster in the nation. This season, Santa Barbara looks like a much more mature team that is poised to compete for a Big West title behind an arsenal of offensive weapons.</p>\n<p>“We have so many potent offensive players that there will be times where each one of us has our time to shine. For the other team, it makes us hard to guard and hard to scout when we have so many perimeter players and Al down low,” senior guard Kyle Boswell said. “We’ve all kind of excelled in our roles, especially in terms of being unselfish as a team and playing for each other. It’s unlike a team I’ve been on before.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finished non-conference play with a 9-4 overall record, a mark somewhat expected for a squad selected to finish second in the conference preseason media poll. What wasn’t expected, however, was the ability of the Gauchos to stick with some of the top teams in the nation, especially with a non-conference schedule that ranked 29th in the nation in strength of schedule.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The biggest game for UCSB this season was an impressive 72-65 victory over visiting Cal in front of a raucous home crowd. Add in a 86-65 shellacking of UNLV on the road and a victory over South Dakota State, a NCAA tournament team last season, and it is evident the Gauchos have the ability to win both at home and on the road.</p>\n<p>Perhaps equally as telling was UCSB’s ability to play neck-to-neck with a pair of ranked teams in UCLA and Colorado on the road. Santa Barbara eventually lost both but showed in each game that it has the talent to compete with some of the top teams in the country.</p>\n<p>“Being exposed to the best talent in the country is always a good thing in the preseason, it kind of lets you know what’s out there and what you can do as a team to get to their level,” Boswell said. “It really prepares you for league, especially when night in and night out it’s a grind.”</p>\n<p>No one has contributed to the Gauchos progression more than junior center Alan Williams, a first-team All-Big West selection last season. Big Al was a preseason All-Big West selection this year and has delivered in a big way, ranking fifth in the nation in scoring at 23.5 points per game and ninth in the nation in rebounding at 10.4 rebounds per game. Williams is one of only two players in the nation averaging over 20 points and 10 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“[What’s allowed me to perform this well] is my teammates. Them growing as much as I’ve grown and all of us growing together is really important for us,” Big Al said. “I’m only as good as the guys next to me, so me being able to do the things that I’ve been able to do this year is solely based on my teammates’ consistent improvement. They’ve been getting a lot better and everybody’s growing, so it’s been a lot easier on me.”</p>\n<p>Big Al’s most dominant game was a 39-point, nine-rebound, eight-block performance against South Dakota State, but Williams has shown the ability to perform against top-level competition as well. Against UCLA, Big Al scored 23 points to go along with eight rebounds, while he added 24 points and 12 rebounds against Cal.</p>\n<p>“An argument can be made that he is the best big man in the West Coast. When we’ve played against good bigs, when we played against UNLV, when we played against Cal, when we played against those guys, he’s man-handled them,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He’s come a long way and he still has a long way to go. But, boy oh boy, has his passion for competing and his game just expanded to where he is the real deal.”</p>\n<p>Playing second fiddle to Williams is Boswell who ranks second on the team with over 12 points per game. Last year’s Big West Sixth Man of the Year, Boswell is as dangerous a threat from behind the arc as there is in the conference, shooting .488 from the three for fourth best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>Boswell also ranks second on the team with 3.5 assists per game (sixth in the Big West) and his assist to turnover ration ranks 11th in the nation. He, like Williams, has a knack for stepping up in big moments, and despite his role off the bench, is always on the floor when the game is on the line. Boswell</p>\n<p>“Just in the last two seasons being in that role, I just feel comfortable being a spark off the bench,” Boswell said. “The more unselfish we play, the more treacherous we are on the offensive end. We got a lot of guys involved, and in the preseason, we found our roles as team members, and we’re excelling at each of them at this point.”</p>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons for UCSB’s success this season has been limiting turnovers, as the Gauchos 10.8 turnovers per game rank second-best in the Big West. Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon, a transfer from Ventura College, has aided that effort greatly with a conference-best 5.2 assists per game. Harmon ranks ninth in the nation in assist to turnover ratio as well.</p>\n<p>Freshman point guard Eric Childress has helped Santa Barbara off the bench with 3.2 assists (eighth in the Big West) and 1.4 steals per game (10th in the conference).</p>\n<p>“It’s been absolutely a godsend to have two new point guards come into the program … and it’s been so valuable to have two guys whose assist to turnover ratio rank in the top 20 in the country,” Head Coach Williams said. “They’re unselfish pass-first guards, score when they need to and love to defend. They’ve been really good additions to this program.”</p>\n<p>Adding to the depth of UCSB is a pair of talented sophomore wing players in Michael Bryson and Taran Brown. Bryson’s 10.6 points rank third on the team and his .439 three-point percentage ranks sixth in the conference.</p>\n<p>Brown, meanwhile, ranks second for UCSB in blocks and rebounds and is one of the most athletic players in the league with his incredible speed and leaping ability at 6’8”. Both have matured tremendously this season and are a big reason UCSB is taking better care of the ball and ranks as the top three-point shooting team in the conference.</p>\n<p>“We’ve grown as a team, especially mentally, we’ve grown a lot,” Big Al said. “We don’t turn the ball over a lot, and we take care of the ball. We’re a very unselfish team, which is good especially going into league. We’ve got to stay together.”</p>\n<p>Providing important play down low is trio of forwards senior Shawn Moore and sophomores Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler. Moore, a walk-on, provides UCSB with a versatile player who can defend guards or forwards despite his 6’5” frame. Beeler has proven valuable as a backup center and has an imposing presence in the post thanks to his 6’10” build.</p>\n<p>Brewe has emerged the most of the three, breaking his way into the starting lineup and recording his first career double-double on Saturday against Master’s College. Brewe, Beeler and Moore may not be highly celebrated, but all three play important roles for the team, especially defensively.</p>\n<p>Much of the Gauchos success this season can be attributed to its improved defense, as they rank second in the conference in defensive points allowed and first in defensive field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>While the team has stayed relatively healthy, injuries have plagued two important players for the Gauchos. Sophomore guard John Green is out indefinitely with a foot injury, his third in as many years. Green played in one game for the Gauchos this season and his future for the remainder of the season remains in question. Junior point guard T.J. Taylor, last season’s starter, will also miss the entire season due to offseason surgery.</p>\n<p>With such a talented and deep team, UCSB has a great chance to capture the Big West title this season and return to the post season for the third time in the last five seasons.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of things to improve on, but what I like about this team is we’re relentless and we’re always willing to improve on some of the aspects of our game that we struggled with,” Boswell said. “We have so much talent on this team and we’re so close to each other that I feel like something special is bound to happen this year.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins Big West play on Saturday when it hosts rival Cal Poly in the first installment of the Blue-Green rivalry. Tip-off is scheduled for 4 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of January 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53428\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-ucsb-mens-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53428\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-ucsb-mens-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-ucsb-mens-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-ucsb-mens-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-ucsb-mens-basketball/","id":592,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[591,590,589],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Previews: UC Irvine Men’s Basketball","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Irvine-logo.gif?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Irvine-logo.gif?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UC Irvine is a premier contender in the Big West this year after finishing in second place last season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UC Irvine men’s basketball team will try to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history this season, after narrowly failing to do so last year.

Offensively, his game has just expanded,” Head Coach Russell Turner said. “He’s added some things to his game, he’s gotten better, he’s gotten older and he’s confident. He is one of the top players in the conference undoubtedly and I’m real happy with the way he has continued to improve and sacrifice for his teammates.”</p>\n<p>Besting Davis in blocked shots is 7’6” freshman center Mamadou Ndiaye, who averages 3.4 blocks per game, good for 14th in the entire nation. Ndiaye also leads the nation with a .765 field goal percentage, while adding just over nine points and five rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good player who’s very competitive and more skilled in a lot of ways than people expect, so he’s a factor,” Turner said. “That’s what I’ve seen from him all along and I think others have been slow to recognize that. We’re a different team when he’s on the floor because he’s so big.”</p>\n<p>Height is certainly a strength for Irvine as the Anteaters have eight players who are 6’7” or taller, including three seven-footers.</p>\n<p>A pair of guards in senior Chris McNealy and freshman Luke Nelson each add over 11 points per game for the Anteaters. Sophomore guard Alex Young (9.9 points per game) rounds out the starting lineup for Irvine, giving the team a balanced scoring attack from every position on the floor.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got good basketball players at all five spots; we’ve got some depth. The thing I like about us offensively is every guy can pass and that makes us dangerous,” Turner said. “We’re starting two freshmen, so it takes time with a young team. We’ve shown we need some time to get better but we’ve also shown that we’re getting better.”</p>\n<p>One other asset Irvine possesses is a relatively young squad, with McNealy being the only senior on the team. With a young and talented squad, the Anteaters will once again be a threat to win the Big West, both this year and for many seasons to come.</p>\n<p>Irvine begins Big West play on Thursday at Long Beach State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 8, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53430\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-uc-irvine-mens-basketball/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53430\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-uc-irvine-mens-basketball/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-uc-irvine-mens-basketball/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-uc-irvine-mens-basketball/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/big-west-previews-uc-irvine-mens-basketball/","id":596,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[595,594,593],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Defeat Master’s for Third Straight","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1268.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1268.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Wins 81-52 over Master's College","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In its first game of the new year, the UCSB men’s basketball team defeated The Master’s College 81-52 for its third straight victory and sixth win in the last seven games.</p>\n<p>With Saturday’s victory at the Thunderdome, UCSB improves to 9-4 on the season, while Master’s remains at 11-2 as the contest counted as an exhibition for the NAIA school.</p>\n<p>“We wanted to go out there and play hard no matter who we’re playing, and play with a lot of energy and a lot of excitement, and be excited to play the game of basketball,” junior center Alan Williams said. “I think we did that today.

He’s probably as good a gamer, consistently, night in and night out, as anybody that we’ve had here in my 16 years.”</p>\n<p>Leading by a mere five points midway through the first half, the Gauchos went on a 15-0 run to extend their lead to 39-19, essentially putting the game out of reach by halftime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continued to control the game after the break, outscoring Master’s 40-28 in the second half while holding the Mustangs to a 34.5 shooting percentage throughout the contest.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Mitch Brewe recorded his first career double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds. Combined with Williams’s performance, the duo helped give UCSB a 45-28 advantage on the glass and provided a major advantage in the post game.</p>\n<p>“[Mitch is] still fully adjusting to what his role will be, but you can tell he is more and more comfortable week after week of playing and he is more of an asset week after week,” Williams said. “He can be that physical presence that we need. Mitch has become a really valuable player for us, and that’s what we envisioned when we recruited him.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 14 points off the bench, while junior point guard Zalmico Harmon and freshman point guard Eric Childress each added six assists for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s victory concluded the nonconference portion of the schedule for UCSB, which featured an impressive victory over Pac-12 school Cal and narrow road losses at the hands of NCAA Tournament contenders UCLA, Colorado and Utah State. The Gauchos enter conference play with the second best nonconference record of any team in the Big West and look to be one of the premiere contenders for the conference title.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we’ve come pretty far. I feel like we can be a lot better,” Big Al said. “We have a lot of areas we can improve on, just little stuff that will turn us from a good team into a great team.”</p>\n<p>UCSB begins Big West play next Saturday, Jan. 11 at home against rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53392\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/gauchos-defeat-masters-for-third-straight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53392\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/gauchos-defeat-masters-for-third-straight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/gauchos-defeat-masters-for-third-straight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/gauchos-defeat-masters-for-third-straight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-06/gauchos-defeat-masters-for-third-straight/","id":594,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[593,592,591],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":14,"route":"/authors/72"}},"__N_SSG":true}
