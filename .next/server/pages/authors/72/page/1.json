Whether it is community service, athletics, academics or anything else, always strive toward a goal and take steps to accomplish them.</p>\n<p>Four years in college may seem like an eternity to some, but if you do it right, you will look back thinking about all the good times and how it just did not seem long enough.</p>\n<p>More than anything, the tragic events of this week remind me just how precious life is. Any one of us, or our friends, could have been a victim on Friday night.</p>\n<p>Surround yourself with people you care about, and likewise care about you. Meet people who challenge and inspire you to improve upon yourself. Life is too short for anything less.</p>\n<p>This year has been a rough one for many at UCSB. Numerous stories and media coverages have engulfed our campus throughout the year, especially in the last week.</p>\n<p>However, despite all this, the resiliency and determination that comes with being a Gaucho has shined.</p>\n<p>The community’s responses and discussions regarding events this year makes me supremely proud to be a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>We care about our community and each other and I will miss the friendly faces on the streets of I.V. I have grown to love.</p>\n<p>Much of my love for UCSB comes from my time and experiences at the Nexus and with Gaucho athletics.</p>\n<p>I was lucky enough to cover the men’s basketball team for two seasons and met some extremely talented, humble and kind people in the process. Big Al, you are a beast and I hope to watch you in the NBA for years to come. Punish the Big West next year and bring the Gauchos back to the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>For all you Gauchos out there, please support our teams for the remainder of your college career. We have up-and-coming baseball, soccer, basketball and volleyball teams that I have had the privilege of covering during my tenure with the Nexus. Grab a few friends and head out to a game sometime; I promise you won’t regret it.</p>\n<p>I personally want to thank everyone at the Nexus for all the hard work and collaboration over the past four years. I also want to especially thank my co-editor Kristen for working with me these past two years. There’s no way I would have made it through all those late nights without the help and collaboration. We definitely made a great team and brought our own unique talents and preferences to the paper.</p>\n<p>Thank you to my brothers and sisters in Alpha Kappa Psi. You made college for me. You challenged me to improve and changed me for the better, and without all my experiences with you all, I would not be ready to enter the real world in a short few weeks.</p>\n<p>Lastly, thank you to all my fellow Gauchos for making these past four years the best of my life. Whether it was celebrating a Gaucho victory over Cal Poly or partying on Deltopia in the respectful way we know how, we had fun and we did it with class. It may not appear that way to outsiders, but we know what we stand for.</p>\n<p>Gauchostrong baby,</p>\n<p>Paul-Michael Ochoa</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of May 28th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55651\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55651\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-28/nexus-sports-editors-say-their-goodbyes-paul-michael-ochoa/","id":3256,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3255,3254,3253],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"From NorCal to SoCal: Returning  to Playoff-Caliber Teams","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sports-art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Lakers’ Success Still Relies on Kobe Bryant","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After the worst season in franchise history, the Los Angeles Lakers have plenty of areas they need to address in the upcoming offseason. While the cupboard is not completely empty, it might be a couple years before the Lakers are back atop the NBA and ready to compete for a championship. Despite the uncertainties facing the team, the Lakers have always shown an ability and willingness to make drastic moves to improve overnight.</p>\n<p>Before making any serious roster decisions, the owners and general manager Mitch Kupchak need to hire the right coach for the team. Thankfully, Mike D’Antoni will not be returning next season. Several people have been rumored as potential fits for the Lakers, including Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott, Mike Dunleavy, Lionel Hollins and Alvin Gentry, among others. Personally, among the names listed, Scott or Hollins make the most sense to me, but that decision will be up to the front office to figure out.</p>\n<p>In terms of the Lakers’ player personnel, it all starts with Kobe Bryant. The future Hall-of-Famer will enter his 18th season with serious questions regarding his ability to play at the same elite level after missing most of last season with injuries to his knee and Achilles. The Lakers made an enormous gesture toward Kobe in awarding him the largest salary in the league, but this big number limits the team in many ways.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Only three players have guaranteed contracts for next season, including Kobe, Steve Nash and Robert Sacre. Nash is the oldest player in the league and missed most of last season with nerve and back injuries. He is a shell of his former self, but may still prove to be an effective distributor if he can stay on the court. Kendall Marshall’s non-guaranteed contract of under $1 million is a good bargain for a player that is still young and possesses a lot of potential.</p>\n<p>Despite Nash and Marshall’s probable inclusion on the roster, point guard will be a major area of emphasis for the Lakers this offseason. The Lakers hold the No. 7 pick in this year’s draft. While top point guard prospect Dante Exum will likely be off the board by then, the Lakers could opt to select Oklahoma State’s Marcus Smart if he is still available. Smart would give the Lakers an aggressive and talented athlete, albeit it one with some past character concerns to speak of. Possible free agent fits include Eric Bledsoe and Darren Collison, although the Phoenix Suns are likely to match any offer made to Bledsoe.</p>\n<p>With Pau Gasol unlikely to return, as he might command too large of a contract in free agency for the Lakers to re-sign him, the team is in need of a talented big man. Some names that could be available to the Lakers in this year’s draft include Kentucky’s Julius Randle, Indiana’s Noah Vonleh or Arizona’s Aaron Gordon. Each would add a presence down low for the Lakers and ooze with potential, although in different aspects of the game.</p>\n<p>There is a limited pool of free agent players this year and the Lakers do not seem like a great fit for the top player on the board, Carmelo Anthony. Los Angeles may be best suited to re-sign the likes of Nick Young and Jodie Meeks, add one or two B-list players and wait until the loaded free agent pool of next season.</p>\n<p>It seems unlikely the Lakers will acquire Kevin Love through a trade, as they do not have the resources others can offer to the Timberwolves.

Last season at Mt. San Jacinto, Smith led his team to the quarterfinals of the California Community College State Tournament while averaging 14 points and 5.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“My staff had watched him play and we just decided that we wanted to add a little bit more depth at the guard position,” Coach Williams said. “I’m very excited to add more physical, quick, aggressive, pressure type defenders to a team that I do believe is going to have the ability to be very good defensively.”</p>\n<p>Also adding to the team’s depth at guard is 6’2” combo guard Gabe Vincent out of Stockton, CA. Vincent attended St. Mary’s High School and played at the highest level of AAU basketball in the state for the Oakland Soldiers.</p>\n<p>“He’s a very well-rounded complete guard that doesn’t really have a weakness, particularly out of high school,” Coach Williams said. “He does everything well. He’s a very good defender, very good rebounder, very good shooter and passer. He really has an extremely well balanced game.”</p>\n<p>Vincent is expected to contribute right away as a shooting guard, but has the skill set to play both the point guard and shooting guard positions.</p>\n<p>“Vincent and Smith will play right away. They’re both very ready physically to contribute. They’re strong, they’re tough, they defend,” Coach Williams said. “They’re not going to be intimidated, neither one of them, and they’re both going to be really good additions.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruiting class is Justin Burks, a 6’6” forward out of Nevada. Burks attended Las Vegas’ Arbor View High School and also played at the highest level of AAU basketball for the Las Vegas Prospects.</p>\n<p>“He adds to the John Green-Michael Bryson type category. He’s versatile, longer, taller,” Coach Williams said. “He’s going to have to get a lot more physical and stronger but his upside is very good.”</p>\n<p>While Burks figures to need more time to adjust to the college game in comparison to Vincent and Smith, he adds versatility and the ability to play and defend the two, three and four positions on the floor.</p>\n<p>“He has a really good mid-range game, and he’s really good off the dribble getting into the paint,” Coach Williams said. “He’s pretty active chasing rebounds. Those things add a lot to us.”</p>\n<p>The three newcomers join a talented and veteran group of players headlined by Williams. Big Al led the Big West in points and rebounds per game, while ranking 12th in the nation in scoring and second nationally in rebounding.</p>\n<p>“Most everybody that’s coming here is excited playing with a guy of Al’s caliber,” Coach Williams said. We think it’s a great thing that we’re adding the pieces to play around a great player.”</p>\n<p>Rising junior guard Michael Bryson played second fiddle to Big Al last season, finishing second on the team in scoring while garnering Big West Honorable Mention. Bryson figures to start at either the shooting guard or small forward position next season.</p>\n<p>Point guard play looks to be a source of strength for the Gauchos next season, thanks in large part to rising senior Zalmico Harmon. Harmon finished last season with the second best assist-to-turnover ratio in the entire nation and finished the year with Big West Honorable Mention accolades.</p>\n<p>“We’re hopeful that Z makes as big as a jump between his junior and senior year as he did during his junior year,” Coach Williams said. “We thought he got way better as the year went on. We feel like he has a whole other level he can go to as his comfort zone in the program rises.”</p>\n<p>Also playing point will be sophomore Eric Childress and junior T.J. Taylor. Childress finished his freshman year with spectacular consistency towards the end of the season, while Taylor is a two-year starter who missed last season with a hip injury.</p>\n<p>Smith will certainly compete for point guard playing time with the trio and Vincent could even work his way into the conversation by the end of the season.</p>\n<p>“It’s not so much that [Smith] would play that position over them, he’d play with them, which allows you to have two point guards on the floor like I did with Eric and Z,” Coach Williams said. “Now we’ll have five guys in the program that are very good with the ball and very good off the bounce.”</p>\n<p>The rest of UCSB’s rotation will consist of rising junior forwards in Mitch Brewe and Sam Beeler, redshirt freshman forward Alex Hart and junior guard John Green. Brewe started much of the year at power forward for the Gauchos last season while Beeler provided solid backup minutes at both the four and five spots.</p>\n<p>Hart redshirted last season but brings a versatile ability to shoot the ball from outside in addition to his 6’10” frame. Green has lost most of his career to injury but has the potential to add another deadly scorer and physical presence to UCSB if he can stay healthy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 20, 2014’s print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55443\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55443\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-21/gauchos-add-depth-with-three-recruits/","id":527,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[526,525,524],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Staying Atop the Big West","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensSoccerPeterVandenbelt-e1411164336940.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MensSoccerPeterVandenbelt-e1411164336940.jpg?resize=600%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB Hopes to Win Conference For Second Straight Year by Bringing in a Crop of New Freshmen.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s soccer team finished this season with a loss to Penn State in the second round of the NCAA Tournament after capturing the regular season Big West Conference title.

Come see the MLS players today before they show up tomorrow, and you’re going to see a lot of that over the next couple of years,” Vom Steeg said. “Next year’s conference freshman of the year will come from this recruiting class.”</p>\n<p><strong>Forwards</strong></p>\n<p>Highlighting the forward class is Sacramento native Dalton Pando, who played club ball with the San Jose Earthquake Academy of the USSF. Pando was ranked No. 50 in Top Drawer Soccer’s top 150 academy players while also receiving the rank of No. 19 forward in the nation and No. 4 player from Northern California Region.</p>\n<p>Also coming from the San Jose Earthquake Academy is forward Alex Liua. The Los Altos native paired with Pando to form a dangerous attack for the Earthquake and will look to continue that next season for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the forwards is Denis Kalamar of Seattle. Kalamar played for the Seattle Sounders Academy for three years and received a Top Drawer Soccer No. 10 ranking in the Pacific Northwest Region for his play.</p>\n<p>“I think a player like Adonis, like Kalamar, Pando, those are attacking players that can go onto a field and change it,” Vom Steeg said. “Alex is another player who attacks. Any of the guys who attack will have an opportunity to play for us next year.”</p>\n<p><strong>Midfielders</strong></p>\n<p>Three players from the L.A. Galaxy Academy headline the midfield group of the Gauchos’ recruiting class. Adonis Amaya is the highest rated prospect coming in for the Gauchos as he received a No. 15 academy rating, No. 5 midfielder rating and a No. 4 rating in the Southern California Region. Amaya played defender for the U-17 U.S. National team and forward for the Galaxy.</p>\n<p>Fellow Galaxy Academy player Axel Mendez joins the Gauchos as the No. 32 ranked prospect out of the Southern California Region, according to Top Drawer Soccer. Mendez brings an attacking style of play to the midfield position for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“The first player that we got to commit from this whole group was actually Axel Mendez,” Vom Steeg said. “Axel is unique to us because we haven’t really had a playmaker out of midfield. He has a real opportunity to contribute right away because of the position he plays.”</p>\n<p>Ryo Fujii also comes from the Galaxy Academy ranking No. 147 in the nation from the USSF Academy system. Fujii, a native of Torrance also ranks No. 21 in Southern California and is the No. 51 midfielder in the nation.</p>\n<p>Ludwig Ahl is one of two international prospects in this season’s recruiting class hailing from Stockholm, Sweden. Ahl played for AIK Stockholm in Sweden’s top amateur league and was considered for the Swedish National Team.</p>\n<p>“In the past, you’d be lucky to find one freshman starting at UCSB,” Vom Steeg said. “Next year, there’s a chance that we can have eight or nine freshman or sophomores starting on the field. I would be really surprised if at least three freshman didn’t start for us next year.”</p>\n<p><strong>Defenders</strong></p>\n<p>The other international player is Julian Busch from Eichenau, Germany where he played for 1860 Munich. Busch played in the U-17 Bundesliga, the top amateur league in Germany against formidable competition from all over Europe.</p>\n<p>“We feel like the international players are a little more mature,” Vom Steeg said. “Those are players that you think can contribute right away because they’re 20 (years old) and once again they have played at a high level.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will add a bit of east coast flair in Dugan Zier of New York. Zier played for the New York Red Bulls Academy and is one of eight USSF Academy players in the Gauchos recruiting class.</p>\n<p>The fourth and final player hailing from the Galaxy Academy is Jeff Quezada. Quezada was team captain for the Galaxy Academy during his time there and played alongside the trio of midfielders in addition to current UCSB players Josh McNeely and Drew Murphy. All six players won a USSF National Title with the Galaxy Academy in 2011.</p>\n<p>“We’re really high on Jeff Quezada. He’s got the respect of his team, he’s the captain of one of the top teams in the country, but again, he plays a really difficult position,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s going to have a great career here at UCSB, but because of the position he plays, there’s a big, huge learning curve there.”</p>\n<p><strong>Goalkeeper</strong></p>\n<p>Brandon Berke of De Anza Force SC rounds out the Gauchos’ recruiting class. Berke will most likely play backup to McNeely this season but provides the Gauchos with solid depth at the goalkeeper position.</p>\n<p>With 11 new players joining an already talented and young squad, the Gauchos look to have a bright future atop the Big West Conference.</p>\n<p>“We’ve really recruited the right type of kids with the right attitudes. I can’t say enough about these players that had the opportunity to go elsewhere; not only other colleges but obviously [they] do what they really want to do at some point, which is be a pro player, but instead they chose to play here at UCSB,” Vom Steeg said. “That is the attitude that will take us really far because I think players will be really committed to the team and committed to having a successful season.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 15, 2014’s print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55294\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55294\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-14/staying-atop-the-big-west/","id":1575,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1574,1573,1572],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The NBA Hits a Home Run and Bans Donald Sterling","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Donald Sterling received a lifetime ban from the NBA for his racist comments caught on audio.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Donald Sterling saga has developed into one of the most stunning and baffling stories in the world of sports in the last several years.</p>\n<p>Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was caught on audio recording telling his girlfriend, Vanessa Stiviano, that he did not want her posting photos of black people on Instagram or bringing black people to Clipper games.

Essentially, Sterling is stripped of all power but remains owner, is responsible for signing checks and fronting money and is still able to make money off the Clippers.</p>\n<p>The next move for the NBA is to remove the title of ownership from Sterling, a move that is possible only if three-quarters or more of NBA owners approve the vote. There is no doubt that owners will approve this, as any vote to keep Sterling as an owner of the NBA will be a black eye for the NBA and the owner of whichever franchise votes to keep him.</p>\n<p>Silver and the league office hit a grand slam with the decision to ban Sterling for life given the circumstances of Sterling’s comments and his previous racist actions. Social media exploded following Tuesday morning’s announcement as journalists, owners and players, current and former alike, all praised Silver’s decision to hand out the maximum punishment allowed to Sterling.</p>\n<p>Sterling deserves all backlash and punishment that comes his way following these remarks. However, his previous actions also call into question why he was allowed to continue as owner of the Clippers.</p>\n<p>Previously, Sterling was accused of discriminating against families with children, and Black and Latino tenants in apartment buildings he owns. A settlement was agreed upon and Sterling never admitted to guilt, but there have been several instances where his racial viewpoints have been called into question.</p>\n<p>It was not until the NBA’s hand was pushed by the audio recording that the league chose to take action against Sterling. It is a shame that he was allowed to stay for so long in a league so renowned for its progressiveness in social matters such as this.</p>\n<p>One reason that Silver’s decision is so justified is it takes pressure off Clippers fans, players and personnel to abandon ship during an important playoff run. Many were calling for those associated with the organization to boycott, calling into question their morals for non-action.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think it is unfair for people to blame players for wanting to continue to play and asking them to forfeit an entire season of hard work in response to an owner’s actions. The players play for each other and the fans, not for the sake of the owner’s happiness. Likewise, fans no longer have to battle whether to continue supporting the team and attend games or boycott and leave the players with empty stands during this critical playoff series.</p>\n<p>This is certainly an important day for the NBA and especially for the Clippers organization. There is no room for this type of behavior or these thoughts in sports and the NBA made the right decision to get rid of Donald Sterling. Good riddance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears on page 10 of April 30, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55084\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55084\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-30/the-nba-hits-a-home-run-and-bans-donald-sterling/","id":535,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[534,533,532],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Solving L.A.’s Woes","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sports Editor Paul-Michael Ochoa examines the Lakers' choices in turning around the team's future","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This season has been hell for Los Angeles Lakers fans as the team is experiencing its worst season in franchise history.

The Lakers need a veteran coach who knows how to handle the personalities that make up an NBA roster. One name that comes to mind is Stan Van Gundy. Van Gundy helped to develop Dwayne Wade and Howard, taking the Heat and Magic to numerous postseason appearances in the process. He also has experience in dealing with divas such as Howard and deserves another shot in the NBA. I like a seasoned NBA coach over a college coach such as John Calipari.</p>\n<p><strong> Draft</strong></p>\n<p>The Lakers need to hit a home run in the upcoming draft. If they are lucky enough to win the lottery and draft Andrew Wiggins or Dante Exum, which would expedite the team’s road back to relevancy. As of now, the Lakers maintain the sixth worst record in the NBA and would set them up to draft someone along the lines of Julius Randle or Aaron Gordon. I think the Lakers would be best suited drafting either a small forward or center.</p>\n<p><strong> Free Agency</strong></p>\n<p>If I’m the Lakers general manager, I DO NOT sign Carmelo Anthony this off-season. If LeBron James opts out of his contract, you obviously take a run at him, although I cannot imagine the backlash if James left Miami where he won two championships to come be the face of the Lakers. Otherwise, this season I try and re-sign Pau Gasol for a cheap contract, let go of Nick Young who will probably command an expensive contract and re-sign a few of the players on the roster such as Jordan Farmar . Let Steve Nash finish out his contract and then sign one or two players. The Lakers should make a run at young players who could blossom into stars such as restricted free agents Eric Bledsoe or Greg Monroe.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The big move I foresee the Lakers making is signing Kevin Love in two years. Pairing Love with Bryant and whichever talent the Lakers draft in the first round will certainly set the team up nicely. Maybe even the next year the Lakers can sign Russell Westbrook and pair him back up with Love. By that time, Bryant will either be out of the league or used as a clutch veteran similar to how the Heat use Ray Allen.</p>\n<p>The Lakers need to make big moves over the next two seasons to return to their glory days. Bryant’s contract and personality make it hard to find a potential partner for him, but if the Lakers can return to respectability next season, they might be challenging for a championship two or three years down the line and be set for the next decade after Bryant retires.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of April 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54720\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/solving-l-a-s-woes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54720\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/solving-l-a-s-woes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/solving-l-a-s-woes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/solving-l-a-s-woes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-09/solving-l-a-s-woes/","id":318,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[317,316,315],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Top Teams at the Start of the 2014 MLB Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Cardinals, Tigers, Dodgers and Red Sox the Teams to Keep an Eye in a Competive League","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The sounds of fans roaring, kids laughing and bats cracking fill the air as the 2014 Major League Baseball (MLB) season is just a few days in.<br>\nWith the Boston Red Sox being the latest improbable team to ride a hot streak to a World Series victory last season, the MLB truly seems to be a league in which the team that is hot at the end of the year usually captures the championship.<br>\nParity certainly seems to be a strength of baseball as any number of teams could conceivably end the season as champions. Here are the top four teams in baseball at the start of the season.</p>\n<p><strong>St. Louis Cardinals</strong><br>\nAlthough the Cardinals fell in the World Series last season, they are back and hungry for another title with their always-consistent model of winning.<br>\nSt. Louis’ biggest strength is its starting rotation, beginning with veteran ace Adam Wainwright and followed by promising youngsters in Shelby Miller, Lance Lynn and Michael Wacha.<br>\nAs for the position players, the Cardinals possess arguably the best defensive catcher in the league with Yadier Molina.<br>\nDespite losing Carlos Beltran in free agency, St. Louis brings back a trio of Matts in Matt Holliday, Matt Adams and Matt Carpenter to provide a reliable and consistent batting order.<br>\nThe Cardinals are an organization that consistently wins due to managerial and front office stability and this season should be another successful one for the organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Detroit Tigers</strong><br>\nDetroit possesses the best hitter in baseball with two-time defending AL MVP Miguel Cabrera.<br>\nThe Tigers made some headlines this season, trading Prince Fielder for second baseman Ian Kinsler, who combined with Cabrera, Torii Hunter and Victor Martinez, forms a dangerous top of the lineup.<br>\nThe starting rotation is deadly with two Cy Young winners in Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer, while Rick Porcello and Anibal Sanchez are solid mid of the rotation guys.<br>\nThe bullpen is still an area of concern for the Tigers, but the team addressed that in the off-season and might be the top team in the American League.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}};

The bullpen is stacked with Kenley Jansen at closer and three former closers in Brian Wilson, J.P. Howell and Chris Perez.<br>\nThe big area of concern is injuries. Hanley Ramirez was the hottest player in baseball for a month last season and Yasiel Puig wasn’t far behind. Both have had issues with nagging injuries in the past. If both can stay healthy and Matt Kemp can come back to his All-Star form, the Dodgers could take home their first World Series trophy since 1988.</p>\n<p><strong>Boston Red Sox</strong><br>\nThe defending World Series champions were expected to be in rebuilding mode last season after a disastrous 2012, but instead gelled and became the best team in baseball.<br>\nBoston brings back the ageless David Ortiz along with Dustin Pedroia.<br>\nThe loss of Jacoby Ellsbury to the Yankees certainly hurts, but the Red Sox have a number of promising young position players in Xander Bogaerts and Will Middlebrooks to pick up the offensive production.<br>\nPitching is still an area of concern for the Red Sox but if John Lackey can continue to be consistent along with Jon Lester, Jake Peavy and Clay Buchholz, Boston has the arsenal of arms to win again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>a version of this article appeared on page 13 of April 2nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54539\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/top-teams-at-the-start-of-the-2014-mlb-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54539\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/top-teams-at-the-start-of-the-2014-mlb-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/top-teams-at-the-start-of-the-2014-mlb-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/top-teams-at-the-start-of-the-2014-mlb-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-02/top-teams-at-the-start-of-the-2014-mlb-season/","id":2063,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[2062,2061,2060],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student Arrested Following Confrontation With Hawaii Coach","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PART_1394243031794_IMG952090.jpg.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PART_1394243031794_IMG952090.jpg.jpeg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1","description":"UCSB is receiving negative attention following an incident at Thursday night's men's basketball game.

Instead of the Gauchos’ victory garnering attention, UCSB is receiving national coverage for an incident of a UCSB student running onto the court and confronting Hawaii head coach Gib Arnold.</p>\n<p>With UCSB leading 30-16 with 6:02 remaining in the first half, Hawaii senior guard Brandon Spearman was assessed a technical foul for complaining to officials. Arnold then rushed to half-court to argue with referees before being restrained by a Hawaii player, receiving a technical foul in the process.</p>\n<p>That is when the student rushed onto the court, angrily confronting Arnold and yelling in the coach’s face. Hawaii players Christian Standhardinger and Garrett Nevels quickly pushed the fan away before anything else happened.

Bob Brontsema, Assistant Athletics Director of Events, Facilities and Operations immediately followed the student into the stands, calmly escorting the student out of the Thunderdome without using force. The student complied, grabbing his jacket before receiving a few high-fives as he walked out of the arena.</p>\n<p>Following his ejection, the student was arrested by campus police and spent the night in a local police holding cell before friends picked him up Friday morning.

The Gauchos, however, dropped a game at UC Irvine last Thursday, a victory which propelled the Anteaters to first place in the conference.</p>\n<p>While UCSB clinched a position in the conference tournament long ago, the team’s seeding is still in question. Theoretically, the Gauchos could finish with anywhere from the No. 1 to No. 4 seed in the tournament.</p>\n<p>“We have to take care of business, we feel this week, because you never know. We think Irvine has a tough game with Fullerton on Thursday,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “You never know what can happen, and we do not want to live with the what-if scenario and we need to win a game this week to assure the No. 2 seed.”</p>\n<p>Leading the effort to regain momentum entering the tournament is junior center Alan ‘Big Al’ Williams. Big Al ranks eighth in the nation in scoring and is second in the country in rebounds per game. Against Hawaii, Big Al powered the Gauchos with game-highs of 20 points and 17 rebounds.</p>\n<p>Equally as impressive has been the play of junior point guard Zalmico Harmon, who ranks second in the nation in assist to turnover ratio as well as second in the conference in assists per game.</p>\n<p>Hawaii will certainly present a challenge to the Gauchos, both down low and on the perimeter. Senior forward Christian Standhardinger is one of the premier big men in the conference, ranking fifth in points and rebounds per game in the conference. Sophomore forward Isaac Fotu, last season’s Freshman of the Year, ranks 10th in the conference in points and rebounds, giving the Rainbow Warriors a talented low post combo.</p>\n<p>“We actually feel Fotu and Standhardinger are the best 5-4 combo in the league because they do everything,” Coach Williams said. “These two, they have to carry the heavy load scoring, they have to carry the heavy load rebounding and they defend the other team’s bigs, obviously. I think these two kids have as big an impact as any two kids on any team in the league.”</p>\n<p>As for the two Gaucho seniors who will be honored tonight, both have had important impacts on the team both on the court and off the court.</p>\n<p>“It means a lot, these guys have put in so much work into the program. It’s a huge thing for us to be able to get our seniors out of here on a good note,” Big Al said. “We definitely want a lot of fan support because we want to send our seniors out right. If we can get everybody to the game, it’d be really awesome. It’s a televised ESPNU game, big time game for us and we want everybody to be there to support us.”</p>\n<p>Boswell ranks third in UCSB history in three-pointers made, finishing last season as the Big West Sixth Man of the Year and All-Big West Honorable Mention. This past week, the mechanical engineering major was named as UCSB’s male Big West Scholar of the Year for the second consecutive time.</p>\n<p>“Kyle is one of the all-time three-point leaders in our school’s history,” Coach Williams said. “He’s a guy, in the last two years, has drawn an awful lot of attention from everybody we’ve played. People try to make sure that Bos doesn’t get an open look.”</p>\n<p>Moore began his career as a transfer walk-on player last season before earning a scholarship this past season. The forward certainly produced both on the court with his physical and smart play, and in the classroom as he will secure his degree this spring.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting because it’s nice to be honored and I get to do it with my best friend here, my roommate (Boswell),” Moore said. “But it’s a little sad, we’ve been here so long and spent so much time in this gym that it’s a little sad, it’s bittersweet. I think that we’re pretty focused to win. Last two games, senior night, it’s something that you have to win on.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Hawaii is scheduled for 6 p.m. at the Thunderdome. The game will be broadcasted on ESPNU.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54387\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54387\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/finishing-the-season-strong/","id":518,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[517,516,515],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Defeat UC Davis in Televised Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.22.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.v.CSU_.Fullerton-7VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.22.2014.UCSB_.Mens_.Basketball.v.CSU_.Fullerton-7VANDENBELT.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Michael Bryson carried the Gauchos to victory Saturday with 19 points and seven rebounds.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With leading scorer and rebounder Alan Williams limited to 16 minutes of playing time due to foul trouble, sophomore guard Michael Bryson picked up the slack, scoring 19 points in the Gauchos’ 67-54 victory over UC Davis on Saturday.</p>\n<p>In an ESPN-televised game, the UCSB men’s basketball team picked up an important road victory that kept the squad in second place in the conference standings and completed a season sweep of the Aggies.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara improved to 19-8 overall with a 10-4 record in the Big West, while Davis (9-20 overall, 4-10 Big West) now sits in a tie for last place in the conference standings.

Harmon ranks second in the nation in his assist to turnover ratio this season.</p>\n<p>Still, the star of the game was Bryson, with his 19 points and seven rebounds. He now ranks second on the team in scoring, right ahead of senior guard Kyle Boswell, who finished with six points on the night.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Corey Hawkins was the only Aggie to register double-digit scoring with 16 points. As a team, Davis shot 38.6 percent from the field compared to a 44.2 percent clip for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos now sit in second place in the conference, one game behind Irvine and a game ahead of Long Beach State. With only two games remaining in the regular season, Santa Barbara needs Irvine to drop a game to force a tie for first place in the conference.

In that victory, however, Irvine was without junior forward Will Davis II, last year’s Big West Defensive Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“He’s a key player for them, no doubt. He’s not one of the top three scorers, but what he is, is a really versatile four/five,” Coach Williams said. “Even though you don’t see him at the five much, I think you will see him at times at the five today. I think you’ll see them go to a small team, press us, play small with the five, and it gives them way more versatility than with their big guys they have.”</p>\n<p>Another player to watch for Irvine is freshman Mamadou Ndiaye. The 7’6” freshman is the tallest player in collegiate basketball and ranks 8th in the nation with 3.19 blocks to per game. Irvine features much depth along its starting line with freshman guard Luke Nelson and senior guard Chris McNealy each averaging over 11 points per game.</p>\n<p>Because of its depth, Irvine has played well of late, as the Anteaters were winners of five straight games before falling to Northridge.</p>\n<p>“We’re looking forward to the test against Irvine,” Coach Williams said. “We’re sure that they will play much better than when they played here against us, and I think we’re ready for the challenge.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game with plenty of momentum as well, winning six of its last seven games; the lone loss coming in overtime to the same Northridge team. Leading the Gauchos is junior center Alan Williams. Big Al leads the nation with 12.0 rebounds per game and ranks 8th in the country with 22.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“Part of [his rebounding ability is] he creates space, but the other part of it is he’s leaner, he’s moving really well, he’s got great instincts, he follows where the ball is going and he reads it really well,” Coach Williams said. “He’s just got great gifts, tremendous feet, tremendous hands, he’s a very good player.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos have come to expect greatness from Big Al, another player in junior point guard Zalmico Harmon has emerged as a game-changer for a UCSB team hitting its stride. Harmon ranks second in the nation with a 4.52 assist to turnover ratio and is second in the conference with over 5.2 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Even more impressive, Harmon has compiled 50 assists and only three turnovers in his last nine games. In addition to his superb ball handling, Harmon has also become an efficient scorer for the Gauchos, notching two 20-point games in the last three contests. In the team’s last game, Harmon racked up 20 points and 10 assists, the first Gaucho to accomplish the feat since 1989.</p>\n<p>“He continues to get better. He makes great decisions and takes great care of the ball, obviously,” Coach Williams said. “He’s shooting the ball with much more confidence now, he’s playing his best basketball of the year and we just kind of expect him to continue to grow.”</p>\n<p>No doubt that on Saturday the Gauchos will rely on what has been working for them all year — feeding Big Al down low and relying on its perimeter shooters to hit outside shots and drive to the rim for open looks.</p>\n<p>UCSB will need to play tremendous defense against an Irvine squad that ranks first in the conference in field goal percentage at 47.5 percent. Santa Barbara held the Anteaters to under 36 percent in the victory earlier this season.</p>\n<p>Irvine also ranks first in the conference in rebounding and will challenge Big Al, the nation’s top rebounder, down low. In the team’s previous matchup, Big Al managed to dominate as he has done all season with 26 points and 10 rebounds, with the Gauchos winning the battle on the glass by eight.</p>\n<p>“There’s high energy, a lot of emotion in this game because it is such a big game and the environment is going to be hostile and they always bring a good crowd,” Big Al said. “It’s definitely going to be a lot of fun to play there and go up against Irvine. We’re really excited. It’s a big game.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s clash between the first-place teams is scheduled to tip-off at 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center in Irvine.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54257\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54257\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-face-anteaters-in-battle-of-first-place-teams/","id":546,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[545,544,543],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts UC Riverside at the Thunderdome With Six Games Left in the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.15.2014-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-CSUN-8_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.15.2014-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-CSUN-8_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in second place in the Big West with six games remaining in the regular season.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With six games left on its schedule, the UCSB men’s basketball team enters the final stretch of the regular season in hopes of finishing atop the Big West Conference standings.

In that contest, UCSB took an 11-point lead and built it to an eventual 17-point advantage in the second half. The Gauchos struggled to close out the game, however, allowing Riverside to creep back and send the game to overtime before an eventual 68-65 victory avoided an epic collapse.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had several of these this year where we’ve had leads and we’ve let things slip away. We have to develop more of a killer instinct to finish games,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We have to get hungrier in terms of our approach to each game and how we play for 40 minutes in the game. All of a sudden we’re up and you see us relax a little bit and that’s a dangerous habit to be falling into.”</p>\n<p>Closing out games has become a major area of concern for Santa Barbara and hurt the team in last Saturday’s 80-78 overtime loss to Cal State Northridge despite holding a seven-point lead with just over a minute remaining in regulation.</p>\n<p>In Saturday’s loss, UCSB failed to score in the final two minutes of overtime and turned the ball over 18 times during the entire contest. Turnovers will certainly be a key to Thursday’s contest as Riverside ranks last in the Big West with over 13 turnovers committed per game, compared to second-best UCSB with 11.4 per game.</p>\n<p>“In that Northridge game, there were certain plays we didn’t run and we didn’t do all the tasks that we needed to do to win that game and it came back to bite us,” junior center Alan Williams said. “We’ve really got to focus up on that and be more mentally tough and I think we’ll be fine.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters the contest with an 8-17 overall record and 3-8 mark in conference play, which places the team last in the Big West standings. The Highlanders are currently on a three-game losing streak at the hands of three of the top teams in the conference in Long Beach, Hawaii and Irvine.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we just come out and we try to assert ourselves more consistently throughout a 40-minute game instead of the lapses that we’ve been having,” Coach Williams said. “Hopefully our familiarity is good with them, but I think they’re a better team. They’re a better team now than they were earlier this year.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Highlanders will be a pair of forwards in senior Chris Patton and sophomore Taylor Johns. Patton leads the team with 13.3 points per game, while Johns trails right behind at 13.1 per game. Johns also ranks third in the conference with 8.2 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game ranked No. 13 in College Insider’s Mid-Major poll, powered by the play of Big Al. Williams ranks ninth in the nation in scoring at 22.7 points per game and is second in the country with 11.5 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Playing well as of late for the Gauchos is point guard Zalmico Harmon who ranks third in the nation with a 4.07 assist to turnover ratio. Against Northridge, the junior scored a career-high 21 points, dished out eight assists and committed only one turnover.</p>\n<p>“If we play our game, we’re able to beat anybody in this league,” Bryson said. “When we get let down is when we start kind of being nonchalant with our actions and nonchalant with our execution, so I think if we really play 40 minutes of basketball … we’ll come out with a win.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Thursday’s contest at the Thunderdome is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of February 20, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54114\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54114\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-20/ucsb-hosts-uc-riverside-at-the-thunderdome-with-six-games-left-in-the-season/","id":539,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[538,537,536],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kyle Boswell: A True Student Athlete","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-Cal-12.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12.6.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs.-Cal-12.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Boswell Balances One of the Toughest Majors on Campus With His Critical Role For UCSB Basketball","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The technical terms ‘high-post screen’ and ‘thermodynamics’ are often discussed in different circles and rarely intermix in a conversation.

While at Edison, Boswell became the all-time leader in career points, averaging over 23 points per game as a senior behind a deadly perimeter shot. That outside shot garnered the attention of UCSB, a dream come true for Kyle, who was interested in more than just basketball.</p>\n<p>With a scholarship in hand, Boswell knew he wanted to become a Gaucho and major in mechanical engineering, but faced road blocks in achieving that goal from the time he stepped on campus.</p>\n<p>“Our engineering program is definitely at the top of the line. I didn’t get into the program because it was so competitive,” Boswell said. “I had to petition and take some courses and compete against some of the people for them to even consider me to get into the major. After about a year and a half, they told me my performance in the classroom was good enough to let me in. That in itself was a blessing.”</p>\n<p>His 3.8 GPA is evidence enough that he warranted a spot in an engineering program that often ranks in the top 25 in the nation.</p>\n<p>Moving onto campus, Boswell had the task of balancing more than your average Gaucho had to, adjusting to college life and taking engineering courses in addition to his duties as a basketball player. During his freshman year, Boswell played a reserve role for a team that advanced to the NCAA Tournament, starting six of the 21 contests he played in.</p>\n<p>During his sophomore season, Boswell truly became an outside weapon for Santa Barbara, leading the team in three-point field goal percentage while ranking in the top four in minutes played. This is when Boswell emerged as a sixth man for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“I absolutely love being the sixth man. I like to kind of sit back for a couple minutes in the game, see the landscape and how the flow’s going, how our team’s playing and what I need to do coming off the bench,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Since then, Boswell has volunteered to come off the bench, a role in which he has certainly found success. Last season, Boswell averaged 13 points per game on his way to the Sixth Man of the Year award and all-conference honorable mention. This year, he ranks second on the Gauchos in scoring with 11 points per game and currently ranks third in school history in three-pointers made.</p>\n<p>Aside from his success on the court, Boswell has received tremendous recognition for his ability to balance academics as well. This past fall Boswell was named one of 30 semi-finalists for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award, was named the Big West Scholar Athlete of the Year for men’s basketball and is also a two-time recipient of the Golden Eagle award for academic excellence.</p>\n<p>“In terms of being successful here as a student athlete, anyone can do it. I’m not like a freak of nature, who, like no other kid in the school, can do what I do,” Boswell said. “You’ve honestly got to love what you do and just put in the work. It’s the lifestyle; you’ve got to embrace the challenge and give it all you got.”</p>\n<p>While not unheard of, being a student-athlete in the engineering department is certainly rare, and something Boswell and his professors must talk over due to the demands of travel for competition.</p>\n<p>“Not many athletes come out of this department so it’s kind of new for [professors]. Kind of every quarter, I need to talk to teachers right away and let them know my situation,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>This upcoming summer, Boswell will intern with Chevron in Los Angeles in a major step towards achieving his eventual goal of working in an oil field.</p>\n<p>“I feel like it will be great for me because I love learning about the thermodynamics side of stuff and fluid mechanics, and you put that together and you get working in an oil field,” Boswell said.</p>\n<p>Boswell will exhaust his eligibility for basketball after this season, but will return to UCSB next year to complete his degree without the athlete title. Needless to say, academics should be a piece of cake for Boswell next year without the extra demand of collegiate athletics.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that I could have only dreamed about. You don’t get this many opportunities in life where you’re exposed to such a high caliber education and at the same time you’re playing at the highest collegiate level of basketball,” Boswell said. “UCSB is a paradise and I couldn’t ask for anything more out of the school.”</p>\n<p>Boswell and the rest of the UCSB men’s basketball team host UC Riverside tomorrow at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of Feb. 19th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54068\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54068\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-19/kyle-boswell-a-true-student-athlete/","id":538,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[537,536,535],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Go For Fourth Straight Victory at Long Beach State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Mens_.Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt-1.30.2014.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/UCSB.Mens_.Basketball-Peter-Vandenbelt-1.30.2014.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB has already defeated Long Beach State this season and will attempt to sweep the season series Thursday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Exactly at the halfway point of conference play, the UCSB men’s basketball team has often looked like the best team in the Big West.

If we stick to the game plan and listen to the coaches play … we’ll have a good chance.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>When the two teams previously met, Santa Barbara defeated Long Beach 64-51 at the Thunderdome behind a balanced offensive attack with no player scoring more than 13 points. Despite committing 19 turnovers (compared to the 49ers’ seven), the Gauchos managed to hold Long Beach to under 30 percent shooting on the night and an even worse 19 percent in three-pointers.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure it’s going to be a lot tougher to play there because I would bet money that they shoot a whole lot better [tonight] than they did at our place,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “They’ve won five of their last six in league and they’ve been a very formidable team.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach’s leading scorer and assist man in junior point guard Mike Caffey led the team with 21 points last time against UCSB, but was the only player to score in double figures. Junior guard Tyler Lamb, who averages over 15 points per game, was held to five points on a dreadful 1-13 shooting in the loss.</p>\n<p>“That’s what our goal is, to execute our defense the way we need to and make them take the shots we want them to take,” sophomore guard Michael Bryson said. “I doubt they’re going to shoot as poorly as they did at our house.”</p>\n<p>Bryson led the Gauchos with 13 points against Long Beach in January and has lifted UCSB in recent games, scoring 18 in last week’s victory over Hawaii. The athletic wing player ranks third on the team with just under 11 points per game.</p>\n<p>“He’s regained his shooting form and he’s playing very physical and rebounding and playing tough,” Coach Williams said. “He’s a key ingredient for us. He’s one of those versatile pieces that allows us to play several different sizes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game off three straight victories, the fourth such time this season. The Gauchos have yet to win four straight, however, and will look to do so against a Long Beach team that will have the crowd on its side.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really tough environment, it’s a great home crowd. They’ll have it sold out, it’ll be rocking,” Coach Williams said. “They’ve made basketball a real priority there and you can tell by their home attendance that it’s something that they’ve put a lot into as a whole school.”</p>\n<p>Leading the charge in the hostile environment will be Big Al who ranks eighth in the country in points per game and fourth in rebounds. Williams leads the Big West in points and rebounds, is second in blocks and ranks seventh in field goal percentage and steals.</p>\n<p>“Al has had a superior year, he’s been absolutely spectacular. He brings it night in and night out and I think he’s getting better,” Coach Williams said. “His conditioning looks better, his confidence in shooting the ball from the perimeter is getting better — he’s improving in every way.”</p>\n<p>While things are certainly looking good for the Gauchos as a program, the team received devastating news that sophomore guard John Green will miss the rest of the season with a fractured wrist. Green previously missed the past two seasons with foot injuries, and after finally playing in his first regular season game as a Gaucho this season, will miss a third consecutive year to injury.</p>\n<p>“It sucks. It’s a really sad and unfortunate and unlucky kind of situation. John is the strongest guy that I know and I know he’ll get through it,” Big Al said. “We’ll consistently pray for him and maintain our faith. He’s going through a lot right now but his spirits are up and this team is picking him up. I just can’t wait until he finally gets back out there on the court.”</p>\n<p>Now with even more motivation to play for their fallen teammate, the Gauchos will certainly be ready for the task against a Long Beach program that has consistently battled UCSB atop the Big West standings in recent years.</p>\n<p>“We think it’s going to be a pretty hostile place. It always is,” Big Al said. “It’s always a big game between us two and their fans really show up and make a lot of noise. They’re going to be out there hungry for a win so it should be a good environment.”</p>\n<p>UCSB faces Long Beach State at the Walter Pyramid tonight for a 7 p.m. start time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of February 13, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54014\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54014\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-13/gauchos-go-for-fourth-straight-victory-at-long-beach-state/","id":533,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[532,531,530],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Takes Down Hawaii in Honolulu","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos defeat Hawaii 75-64","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>On its longest road trip of the season, the UCSB men’s basketball team defeated Hawaii 75-64 in a come-from-behind fashion Thursday to remain near the top of the Big West standings.

Junior point guard Zalmico Harmon scored all 10 of his points in the second half on an efficient 4-5 shooting night.</p>\n<p>A pair of forwards in sophomore Isaac Fotu and senior Christian Standhardinger led Hawaii. Fotu finished the game with 17 points and eight rebounds, while Standhardinger totaled 15 points and nine boards.</p>\n<p>With the rebounding and turnover margins relatively similar, this game came down to the shooting of both teams. The Gauchos were 8-22 shooting from beyond the arc compared to just 3-19 for the Rainbow Warriors and made the same amount of field goals despite 11 fewer shot attempts.</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to Long Beach State on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53928\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53928\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-10/ucsb-takes-down-hawaii-in-honolulu/","id":561,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[560,559,558],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":14,"route":"/authors/72"}},"__N_SSG":true}
