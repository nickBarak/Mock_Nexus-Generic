To get a big fish out here at the Thunderdome, we’re just excited about it,” senior guard Kyle Boswell said. “It’s going to be a fun experience, hopefully a lot of people will come out to the game, and we’ll put on a good show and the result will show it.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Despite the 3-3 mark, the Gauchos have outperformed their record, narrowly dropping games against Utah State and Colorado without junior center Alan Williams. With Williams, Santa Barbara is 3-1, the lone loss coming to UCLA.</p>\n<p>“We’re encouraged by the fact that we can compete in a game like this in the future. We had a good shot at putting them away and getting the upset,” Boswell said. “We have to take out the positive things because we have a huge game on Friday against Cal coming to our place. We just know that we can play with anyone and we’ve proven that this year.”</p>\n<p>Against the Bruins, UCSB did not look like a team from a smaller conference facing a power conference team. Instead, Santa Barbara battled for the majority of the game, taking a 42-42 tie into the half at legendary Pauley Pavilion. UCSB even led in the second half before a run by the Bruins put the game out of reach. Big Al led the Gauchos with 23 points to go along with eight rebounds, but the outside shooting of UCSB was the real storyline in this game.</p>\n<p>Boswell finished with 18 points shooting 5-9 from behind the arc. Sophomore guard Michael Bryson added 15 points and 10 rebounds. Bryson and junior guard Zalmico Harmon each shot 3-5 from the three while sophomore forward Taran Brown was 2-6. Overall, UCSB shot 50 percent on threes, including an impressive 9-14 in the first half.</p>\n<p>“We have a lot of good shooters on the perimeter surrounding Al down low, so if we’re not hitting threes and having people close down on us hard, we’re going to go inside,” Boswell said. “If we go inside and they’re doubling Al, we’re going to kick it out. We have a lot of inside-outside game that we pride ourselves on, especially with two quick point guards that can get into the lane.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to another Pac-12 opponent, UCSB hosts a Golden Bears’ squad that defeated Big West team UC Irvine 73-56 on Monday. Senior guard Justin Cobbs leads Cal with 14 points and over six assists per game. Senior forward Richard Solomon will provide a formidable opponent down low against Big Al, as the senior averages a double-double with over 11 points and 10 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly has the weapons to challenge the Golden Bears, led by Big Al’s Big West leading numbers of 27.5 points, 10.8 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. Bryson ranks second on the team with 12.7 points per game, while Boswell is third at 11 points and Brown fourth at 10.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>Friday’s matchup against Cal looms as the Gauchos biggest nonconference home game of the season.</p>\n<p>“[A victory against Cal] would be huge. UCLA was a really big team and that just showed us just how dominant Big Al is,” Boswell said. “We nearly beat Utah State and Colorado even without Al, so the fact that he’s going to be a presence on Friday, they’re going to have to pick their spots. He’s going to cause a lot of problems for Cal so hopefully we’ll take advantage of that.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s tip-off against Cal is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of December 5, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53348\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53348\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-12-05/gauchos-host-cal-for-first-time-since-1979/","id":589,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[588,587,586],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ends Season With Loss to Penn State","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Soccer.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Soccer.jpg?resize=840%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Injuries and red cards plagued UCSB Sunday night.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a promising and historic year, the No. 10 UCSB men’s soccer team’s season came to an end Sunday night in a 1-0 loss to Penn State in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara finishes the season with a final overall record of 12-6-3 after a historic undefeated 7-0-3 mark in the Big West.

A red card to senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden in the sixth minute of the game did not help the shorthanded Gauchos as UCSB was forced to play a man down for basically the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>“Fifi was the only player on the field that has played in an NCAA playoff game,” Vom Steeg said. “Seven minutes in we went down to zero players that have played in a playoff game.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing a man down, UCSB controlled the ball for much of the first half and matched Penn State with three first half shots apiece. Both teams went into the half scoreless.</p>\n<p>The second half proved to be the difference for the Nittany Lions as freshman forward Connor Maloney gave Penn State a 1-0 lead with a strike from 18 yards out in the 78th minute. Penn State finished the night with 10 shots compared to just four for UCSB, including a four-to-one advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, [we’re] very disappointed to lose a goal. When we went down, it was just roll your sleeves up and fight and it’s what we’ve done all year,” senior defender Daniel Welsh said. “It’s a season to build on for next year for the guys who are coming back.

Junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez and freshman midfielder Drew Murphy both received red cards during last week’s loss to Northridge and will be forced to sit out of Sunday’s match.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Gauchos may be without a pair of seniors in forward Achille Campion and defender Peter Schmetz due to injury.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t really probably going to get an answer [on injuries] until closer to Saturday,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re pretty optimistic that Campion will be playing, at least try to play. Schmetz is probably a little bit of a longer shot. At the end of the day, it’ll be a game time decision really.”</p>\n<p>Penn State enters today’s contest as the host, finishing the regular season with an 11-5-2 overall and 5-1 mark in the Big Ten, good enough for a regular season conference title.</p>\n<p>“No matter who we play, it’s all going to come down to who has the energy and who’s ready to show up on Sunday,” Baiden said. “No matter who we play, we just need to make sure we come out with a ton of energy and make sure we get our goals to get the win.”</p>\n<p>St. Francis Brooklyn, meanwhile, finished the season 12-5-1 and 4-3 in conference, closing out the season with a three-game winning streak and a Northeast Conference Tournament title.</p>\n<p>“Our focus has really been on our own preparation. We do know a lot more about Penn State because they’re a little bit more out there, they’ve played some people we’re familiar with,” Vom Steeg said. “We literally know nothing about St. Francis. What we do know is someone is going to have to travel 3,000 miles to have to play us on Sunday.”</p>\n<p>Joining UCSB in the NCAA Tournament from the Big West include No. 15 Northridge and No. 13 UC Irvine. This is the first time in conference history three teams have qualified for the tournament, and even more impressively, the first time three teams have received a top 16 ranking and a first round bye.</p>\n<p>“It is historical. To have the three teams out of the Big West seeded that’s really remarkable and speaks a lot about the quality of the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “Realistically, think about how tough it was to go undefeated in conference play during a year when two other teams are seeded in the tournament.”</p>\n<p>This is the 11th time in the last 12 seasons the Gauchos have made a postseason appearance. UCSB is 11-1 all-time in NCAA Tournament matches played at home and can add to its already impressive postseason legacy on Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We’re just trying to find a way to win on Sunday and if we can do that I think we have a good chance to win the next game,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s hard enough to miss two all-league performers but now you add two other starters and it’s going to make it real tough.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Sunday’s NCAA Tournament second round match is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of November 21’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53139\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53139\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/the-quest-for-a-national-title-starts-at-harder/","id":1568,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1567,1566,1565],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Heads to Colorado to Face off Against Pac-12 Foe","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Vandenbelt_11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-17.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Vandenbelt_11.16.2013-UCSB-Mens-Basketball-vs-Utah-State-17.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos Play Colorado on the Road","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With an impressive road victory already on its resume this season, the UCSB men’s basketball team will have a chance to add another road win today when it faces Colorado in a game that will be aired on the Pac-12 Network.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the game with a 2-1 record, while Colorado, a NCAA Tournament team last year, comes into Thursday’s contest at 4-1 on the season.

The 6’10” Scott will certainly provide a formidable post presence against the Gauchos in what could be a marquee matchup should Big Al play Thursday.</p>\n<p>Just over a week ago, Santa Barbara demolished UNLV 86-65 on the road, showing this relatively young team can handle the pressures of the road. The Gauchos’ ability to handle hostile crowds will be significantly tested in Boulder where the Buffaloes have averaged over 8,500 fans in attendance during their first four home games.</p>\n<p>In the absence of Williams, sophomore forward Sam Beeler posted 14 points and five rebounds in a career-high 28 minutes played against Utah State.

One such example this season is quarterback Cam Newton and the emergence of the Carolina Panthers as a postseason contender. The Panthers currently own the third-best record in the National Football Conference (NFC) and sit only one game behind the New Orleans Saints in the NFC South. Carolina has won six straight games, the previous two over perennial Super Bowl contenders in the San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots and looks like a team with a legitimate chance to make a postseason run.</p>\n<p>Before delving into why the Panthers have been so successful this season, I will address the controversial victory over the Patriots on Monday Night Football. In the final play of the game, linebacker Luke Kuechly wrapped his arms around Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski as Patriots quarterback Tom Brady’s last-second heave was intercepted by Panthers safety Robert Lester. The back judge threw a flag for pass interference before conferencing with the other officials. The referees then proceeded to pick up the flag, say there was no foul on the play and run off the field. There was no explanation offered to the Patriots and the game simply ended in a controversial non-call.</p>\n<p>First off, the officials should have explained waving off the penalty. Analysts seem split on whether this play warranted a flag, and I’m on the side saying Brady deserved an opportunity to give the Patriots a win with one final play from the one-yard line. Sure, maybe Gronkowski wouldn’t have been able to get back to the ball in time to stop the interception. But the play was too close to call to avoid such a blatantly clear penalty. It’s not as if the ball was 15 feet above Gronkowski’s head or twenty yards short. Gronk was close enough to the play that if he wasn’t held, it is reasonable enough to imagine a player of his magnitude at least tipping the ball in the air and extending the play.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>I think it should have been a penalty giving the Patriots one final play to win the game, but that was not the sole determiner in the game. The Panthers played extremely well against a talented New England squad and asserted themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the NFL this season with back-to-back quality wins over probable postseason squads.</p>\n<p>Newton has improved his play this season tremendously, and while his passing yardage totals are down from his first two seasons, his accuracy and decision-making skills are way up. Newton ranks ninth in the NFL in quarterback rating at 91.8 and finished Monday’s game 19-28 with 209 yards passing and three touchdowns. Add in an additional 62 yards on the ground and Newton really displayed just how dangerous he can be to opposing defenses.</p>\n<p>The former Heisman winner displays the big-play ability, both with his arm and legs, to make Carolina just dangerous enough to scrape by offensively. Carolina’s key offensively is Newton and the Panthers live or die depending on how Cam performs week to week.</p>\n<p>Carolina’s offense may not be elite, but the Panthers possess some formidable weapons in deep-threat receiver Steve Smith, a tough pass catching tight end in Greg Olsen and a trio of diversely skilled running backs in DeAngelo Williams, Jonathan Stewart and Mike Tolbert. It’s certainly not the best or even one of the top ten offenses in the NFL, but with such a dominant defense, the Panthers don’t need their offense to carry them every game. Newton just has to limit mistakes and make enough big plays to ensure the Panthers put points on the board and keep it out of the other team’s hands.</p>\n<p>Where the Panthers’ true strength lies is in its defense. Carolina is allowing a mere 13.5 points per game through 10 games this season, a mark that if it holds up over the remainder of the season would rank as the lowest point per game total allowed by a defense in the NFL since the 2006 Baltimore Ravens. Pretty impressive for a Panthers squad that started the season 1-3 including losses in which they allowed over 20 points at the hands of Buffalo and Arizona.</p>\n<p>Kuechly and fellow linebacker Thomas Davis are racking up the tackles in the middle of the field, ranking ninth and 13th in the league in tackles, respectively. The duo has combined for a total of 170 tackles. On the defensive line, defensive end Charles Johnson ranks ninth in the NFL with 8.5 sacks this season, while defensive tackles Dwan Edwards and Star Lotulelei have helped the Panthers stuff the run. Carolina ranks third in the league allowing 84.5 rushing yards per game.</p>\n<p>The defensive secondary has been solid all season as well, aided by the frequent pressure the front seven puts on quarterbacks. Carolina ranks fifth in the league in passing yards allowed and is second in forced turnovers with 23 this season. The Panthers rank third in the league in turnover differential, a major component to the team’s success this season.</p>\n<p>With a roster consisting of many young and developing stars, the Panthers’ brightest days are certainly ahead of them. Already possessing a dominant defense and a still growing and versatile franchise quarterback, Carolina is in position to be a NFC South contender over the next several years. NFL teams should be afraid if the Panthers continue to perform as they have during this six-game winning streak, especially if they can continue defeating elite teams like the 49ers and Patriots.</p>\n<p>Carolina’s ceiling this season depends largely on the two remaining games against New Orleans in weeks 14 and 16. If the Panthers can manage to win one of these matchups, or even miraculously pull off a sweep, a NFC South title and possibly even a first-round bye would not be out of the question. Aside from these two games, the Panthers’ remaining schedule is less than daunting with matchups against the inconsistent Dolphins and Jets, and games against the lowly Buccaneers and Falcons. An 11-win campaign, as unlikely as it would have seemed at the beginning of the year, looks like a definite possibility for Carolina this season.</p>\n<p>Flaws remain for the Panthers however, specifically in the running game, where they have had only one 100-yard rusher in a game all season. As a young squad, it is still early to tell whether Carolina can maintain its current pace and make the postseason in a competitive NFC. This is after all a team that lost earlier in the season to a mediocre Buffalo team.</p>\n<p>Again, if Carolina continues its spectacular defensive play and Newton can avoid costly turnovers and make big drive-extending plays when necessary, Carolina could emerge as the surprise team of the season. If the next six weeks of the season are in any way like the previous six for the Panthers, the NFL better watch out for Carolina come the postseason.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 20, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Irene Kuo of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-19/carolina-panthers-cooking-up-something-special/","id":3244,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3243,3242,3241],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to Matadors in Big West Semifinals","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soccer.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/soccer.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB finds out its fate Monday morning for the NCAA Tournament selection show.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>It is always disappointing when an undefeated streak comes to an end, but that was certainly the case Friday night when the No. 8 UCSB men’s soccer team fell to No. 22 Cal State Northridge 3-2 in a dramatic Big West Semifinals match.

Senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko then gave the Gauchos the advantage with a beautiful free kick from 20 yards out in the 72nd minute.</p>\n<p>“We battled back and I thought we did what we did all year, which is compete,” Vom Steeg said. “I think if we stay right with 11 players, we win the game.”</p>\n<p>A second yellow card to junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez on a handball left UCSB shorthanded in the 73rd minute, opening the door for Northridge.</p>\n<p>Lev-Ari responded with a penalty kick goal in the 78th minute and another header in the 83rd to give the Matadors the victory.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will be without Garcia-Lopez as well as freshman midfielder Drew Murphy in its next match. Both players must sit out for receiving red cards during Friday night’s contest. Cazares was also injured during the game but is expected to return in time for the Gauchos’ first NCAA Tournament match.</p>\n<p>“It’s frustrating. It’s like watching a train wreck and you can’t stop it,” Vom Steeg said of the red cards and Northridge’s comeback.</p>\n<p>The top 16 teams in the tournament are given a first-round bye and host a second round match, meaning UCSB would receive more time off in an effort to rest injured players including senior forward Achille Campion and senior defender Peter Schmetz, both All Conference First Team Selections.</p>\n<p>“What’s critical is to not have to play on Thursday,” Vom Steeg said. “And that gives us until next Sunday to see about Campion and to see about Schmetz.”</p>\n<p>UCSB finds out its destiny Monday and is expected to play either Thursday or Sunday in the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53069\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53069\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/ucsb-falls-to-matadors-in-big-west-semifinals/","id":1569,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1568,1567,1566],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Utah State Defeats Shorthanded Gauchos","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/basketball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/basketball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB lost for the first time this season on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB men’s basketball team suffered its first loss of the season Saturday in a 71-64 loss to Utah State at the Thunderdome.

Coming off an impressive victory at UNLV, the confident Gauchos were dealt a serious blow without Williams to go along with the absence of sophomore guard John Green due to injury.</p>\n<p>Down by as much as 14 in the first half, UCSB struggled to shut down the shooters of Utah State for a majority of the game. The Aggies entered halftime with a 39-29 advantage thanks in large part to a pair of senior guards in Spencer Butterfield (16 points and seven rebounds) and Preston Medlin (18 points).</p>\n<p>“I thought the first half they were just nervous without Al and they tried to do too much and they were jittery,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “In the second half our quickness got them going. We went small and the quickness affected the game. We got some strips, we got out and ran, so it took them a while to adjust to our quickness.”</p>\n<p>Halftime adjustments led to an 11-0 UCSB run to open the second half as the Gauchos took a 40-39 lead. Both teams battled from then on with the Aggies holding a three-point lead with 30 seconds remaining in the game. Utah State made free throws down the stretch however to close the game and secure a victory.</p>\n<p>“Obviously we got out way more in transition than we have in the past. I think we’re a very good transition team,” sophomore forward Sam Beeler said. “The more we can get stops and do all that stuff and get out and run, the more chance we have to make open shots.”</p>\n<p>Bryson led UCSB with 15 points on the night, while Beeler registered 14 points and five rebounds in replacement of Big Al. Senior guard Kyle Boswell added 11 points but was unable to find many open looks from the three because of the absence of Big Al.</p>\n<p>“With Sam and Al in there they definitely have to help down. Al goes down there and he kills. Sam goes in there … and he is bigger and taller and able to go over the top and make shots,” Bryson said. “That presence wasn’t there offensively so we definitely had to try something different this game. We came back but it just wasn’t enough this time.”</p>\n<p>Point guard play was one area of strength for Santa Barbara Saturday as freshman Eric Childress and junior Zalmico Harmon combined for nine assists and only one turnover. Childress finished the game with seven points, five assists, four rebounds and two stills. Harmon added six points and four assists.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome, the Gauchos managed to find offensive production despite finding out they would be without their best player minutes before tip-off.</p>\n<p>“[Utah State] never doubled anybody and I thought their gameplan was right on. They adjusted very quickly to what we were doing,” Coach Williams said. “We were doing stuff that we were not prepared to do. We had to do stuff to try to compensate losing Al and losing John. “</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face Colorado on Thursday for a 5 p.m. game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53071\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53071\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/utah-state-defeats-shorthanded-gauchos/","id":613,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[612,611,610],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Try to Stay Perfect","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1172.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1172.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Men's basketball hosts Utah State Saturday","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Fresh off an impressive 86-65 thrashing of UNLV on the road Tuesday night, the UCSB men’s basketball team will face another difficult test, this time in the form of visiting Utah State on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara enters the game with a 2-0 record, while the Aggies come into their first road game of the season with a similar 2-0 mark on the year.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a great test for us. We have about six potential top-25 and tournament teams this year [on our schedule] and Utah State is definitely one of them,” sophomore forward Taran Brown said. “Coming off that big win, we’re going to have a lot of energy and be fired up and ready to go. I think we’ve just got to play the same way we did and it’s going to come out good for us.”</p>\n<p>Both of UCSB’s victories this season have come by more than 20-point margins as the Gauchos defeated Hawaii Pacific 76-50 in the first game of the year.</p>\n<p>Tuesday’s win featured a dominant offensive attack that featured a number of players sharing the wealth. Junior center Alan Williams led UCSB with 21 points and nine rebounds, while senior guard Kyle Boswell scored 19 points after finishing 5-7 from the three-point line.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely a great victory, especially to get a win on the road. For a lot of the new guys, it was obviously their first test on the road,” Boswell said. “We came together as a team and we moved the ball in such an unselfish manner that everybody was able to get involved pretty early in the game.”</p>\n<p>Williams leads UCSB this season averaging 24 points and 13 rebounds per game, marks that both rank first in the Big West. Boswell, meanwhile, has served as a strong second option averaging 14.5 points per game and is shooting just over 57 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>Aiding the duo for the Gauchos is a pair of sophomores in guard Michael Bryson and Taran Brown. Bryson ranks third on the team with 11 points per game. Brown has averaged eight points per game and is second on the squad with seven boards per contest.</p>\n<p>“Teams are scouting us and they know they have to double-team Al. If that’s the case, that’s one kick out … and we have open shots like nothing,” Brown said. “Once that double team is down there, the defense is out of position. Me, Michael and Bos, we’ve got to be ready to get good shots up because once that double team comes, one of us will be open.”</p>\n<p>Guiding the Gauchos from the point is a pair of newcomers to the team in junior Zalmico Harmon and freshman Eric Childress. Harmon has nine assists, averaging 5.5 per game, but has yet to commit a turnover on the season. Childress meanwhile showed flashes of brilliance on Tuesday finishing with nine points and six assists.</p>\n<p>One area of concern for UCSB, however, is the loss of sophomore guard John Green to a foot injury. Expected to be out anywhere from three to six weeks, Green scored eight points in the team’s first game this season before sitting out the UNLV game with injury. His versatility with the ability to shoot from the perimeter and back down smaller guards in the post will be missed by UCSB over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“The absence of John Green means we have to come together more as a team,” Boswell said. “We have so many weapons already on our squad that the key for us is moving the ball and getting everyone involved, which makes it hard for the other team to guard. Everyone on our team has to be ready to fill that role.”</p>\n<p>Utah State, meanwhile, has proven dangerous this season, defeating Pac-12 opponent USC 78-65 before demolishing Southern Utah by a score of 90-57. Senior center Jared Shaw leads the Aggies averaging 18 points and seven rebounds per game, and he will provide a formidable opponent for Big Al in the post.</p>\n<p>With expectations high for Santa Barbara this season, the Gauchos have looked like a strong unit, albeit in a small sample size. Saturday will be another litmus test as to just how good UCSB is this early in the season.</p>\n<p>“We’re coming together as a team really well. We have so much talent on this team that at any given point anyone can kind of take over the game,” Boswell said. “We’re looking for our mistakes and making corrections pretty quickly, which is what you want to be for a mature team to grow up and be able to make a deep run in the tournament later in the season.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off Saturday against Utah State is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52947\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52947\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/gauchos-try-to-stay-perfect/","id":609,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[608,607,606],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"It All Comes Down to This: Playoff Time","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.9.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-Cal-Poly-39.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.9.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-Cal-Poly-39.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on Northridge in the semifinals of the Big West Playoffs","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>A Big West Tournament Championship was one of the main goals for the UCSB men’s soccer team entering this season and that process begins tomorrow night when the No. 5 Gauchos host No. 22 Cal State Northridge in the Big West Semifinals.</p>\n<p>UCSB received a first round bye as Big West North Champs, finishing the regular season with a 12-4-3 overall record and 7-0-3 mark in conference play.

It’ll be a good game and we’re excited to play in big games.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Back in October, UCSB battled a one-loss Northridge team to a 2-1 victory in overtime on the road. Santa Barbara trailed late in the game, but forced overtime with a late goal and later prevailed on a penalty kick in overtime.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara last played Saturday in front of a record 12,805 fans in a thrilling 2-0 victory against rival Cal Poly. The victory extended the Gauchos’ undefeated streak to 11 matches, as they have not lost since late September.</p>\n<p>“We’re confident about Friday more because of how we played against Cal Poly than the fact that six weeks ago we beat Northridge,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re in a good position. I’m supremely confident we’re in the NCAA Tournament based on where things are right now. This is a great time to be playing and it’s a great time because you spend all year for the games like Friday night.”</p>\n<p>Intensity will certainly be ramped up Friday night as both teams are battling for a position in the NCAA Tournament. UCSB looks to have secured a berth in the tournament, but Northridge may still be on the bubble and a victory could go a long way towards a postseason appearance for the Matadors.</p>\n<p>Northridge possesses a potent offense, ranking second in the conference with 40 goals this season, compared to third ranked Santa Barbara, which finished the season with 29 goals.</p>\n<p>“They play more of a kind of simple way of soccer. They look to counterattack with their fast outside forwards who can handle the ball really well and I think that’s how they’ve scored a lot of their goals this season,” freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely said. “We’re going to do our best to watch film and study how they play so we can be as best prepared for the offense as possible.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara possesses the top defense in the conference, allowing a mere 16 goals this season, meaning Friday’s matchup will pit a dangerous offense against a stingy defense.</p>\n<p>“We’re actually really excited because this is the second time playing them and the last time played them we won on a last-minute PK goal, so it’ll be interesting to play them again,” sophomore defender Marshall Cazares said. “They’re a good team, they’re probably the best team in the conference after us, so it should be a good game. We’re pumped.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has performed well this season and will make the NCAA Tournament at the end of the year, but is currently on the borderline of receiving a national seed ensuring a first round bye in the NCAA Tournament. A victory Friday or an outright Big West Tournament Title will strongly increase those odds.</p>\n<p>“Winning on Friday and getting into the Big West Tournament Finals would give us a for sure seed in the NCAA tournament, which is what we’ve based our season off of,” McNeely said. “That would be huge for us and a really big accomplishment so we’re looking forward to trying to get the win on Friday.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff Friday night at Harder Stadium is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of November 14th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52951\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52951\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-14/it-all-comes-down-to-this-playoff-time/","id":1567,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1566,1565,1564],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Fifi Baiden: Ghana Born, Gaucho Bred","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.2.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-UCD-1.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.2.2013-UCSB-Mens-Soccer-vs-UCD-1.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Fifi Baiden has excelled at UCSB on the field and in the classroom.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Soccer for most is a hobby they pick up when young and drop by the time they hit high school.

Our parents wouldn’t be able to afford the education we needed,” Baiden said. “I got lucky to get selected to go to the academy at the age of 10. Right to Dream provided everything to help develop me as a player, and not just on the soccer field, but also a person through education.”</p>\n<p>After developing as a player and attending school, Baiden was presented with a remarkable chance to move to the United States through the academy.</p>\n<p>So, at the age of 15, Baiden left everything and everyone he knew and loved in Ghana for the opportunity to create a better life in America. The academy placed him at Dunn School, a private boarding school in Los Olivos, a mere 35 miles northwest of UCSB.</p>\n<p>During his time at Dunn, Baiden learned to value education and grew as a soccer player, earning team-MVP for three consecutive seasons while garnering interest from universities. Despite his immediate success, the transition from Ghana was not without its bumps.</p>\n<p>“When I got here it was hard for me to transition from Ghanaian culture to here. The accent was hard for me to adjust and my English wasn’t good,” Baiden said. “It was difficult but I had the support system around me when I got here to help me to learn and understand the culture.”</p>\n<p>In addition to playing for Dunn, Baiden also played for the Santa Barbara Soccer Club, leading to his discovery by UCSB.</p>\n<p>Once he stepped on campus at UCSB, Baiden immediately made his impact felt as a Gaucho, playing in 18 games as a true freshman and starting in seven. As a sophomore, Fifi increased his role even more, starting in all 23 games for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“He is responsible for directing our entire midfield, protecting our back four and at the same time linking up our midfield with the rest of our team,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “In my opinion, he plays the most important position on the field for us and does it at a very high level.”</p>\n<p>Baiden’s junior season really saw a takeoff in his game as he ended the season with All-Big West First Team honors along with a spot on the Big West Academic All-Conference Team. With a chance to go pro, Baiden decided to return to receive his degree and play his senior season, a campaign in which he was named All-Big West Second Team.</p>\n<p>“In terms of a teammate, he’s kind of evolved. He was very quiet his freshman and sophomore year,” Vom Steeg said. “Last year, by necessity, he became more of a vocal player and this year he’s the first one in the locker room to urge the guys and encourage them and get after guys. Players listen to him because we know what he’s meant for the program and what he’s done for the team.”</p>\n<p>With the soccer season approaching its end, Fifi is prepared to shift his focus from college to the professional leagues. Baiden will receive his Bachelor’s degree in Sociology in less than four years and begin the process to be drafted in the MLS this season after UCSB concludes its season.</p>\n<p>“He’s a player that in my opinion has the tools needed to play at the next level,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s going to get an opportunity to at least be on an MLS roster with a chance to make that team. Hopefully that happens, and I think it will. We’re pretty optimistic that he’ll get that chance.”</p>\n<p>Now with his status as a budding professional player, Baiden has also shifted his focus to helping the people in his native country. This past summer, Baiden returned to Ghana and saw his family for the first time since he was 15.</p>\n<p>“It was a really fun experience for me to go back to see my family and also to work at this orphanage to teach the kids and help them to value education and also run some drills to help them improve their soccer skills,” Baiden said. “My long-term goal is to actually be a humanitarian and travel around the world, going to impoverished communities trying to help in any way possible I can.”</p>\n<p>Due to the absence of modern technology in Ghana, Baiden was unable to communicate with his family frequently until they were finally able to afford a cell phone.</p>\n<p>As UCSB challenges for the Big West title and an NCAA postseason appearance this season, no player has been as vital to the team’s success than Baiden.</p>\n<p>“You look at two or three things that had to go well for us to be successful and having a healthy Fifi play all season and become a leader on this team through his play is certainly one of the key, if not the most important components of our success,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>It is not every day an individual has the courage to move across the world alone at the age of 15, possess the work ethic and determination to succeed on the field and in the classroom, and possess the humbleness to continue working towards aiding his native people through humanitarian efforts.</p>\n<p>Baiden’s journey to the United States pales in remarkability to all he has managed to and will continue to accomplish. And to think it all started with the kick of a soccer ball.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of November 14, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52921\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52921\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-13/fifi-baiden-ghana-born-gaucho-bred/","id":1566,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1565,1564,1563],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Rival Cal Poly in TV Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensSoccervsSLO_EricSwenson_11-2895818496-O.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MensSoccervsSLO_EricSwenson_11-2895818496-O.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB defeats Cal Poly 2-0 in the final regular season match of the year","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In front of the 12,805 fans in attendance and thousands more on television, the No. 8 UCSB men’s soccer team defeated rival Cal Poly 2-0 at Harder Stadium Saturday on Senior Night.</p>\n<p>With the victory, UCSB improved to 12-4-3 overall and 7-0-3 in conference play, becoming only the second team in history to finish the Big West season undefeated.

On top of it all, UCSB concluded a spectacular undefeated regular season, making this the game of the year for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We made history, so we’re very happy about it,” senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko said. “We also knew our goal was to win conference, and we wanted to win it undefeated and we did. Now I hope we can go and, as a team, get our next goal and win the Big West tournament.”</p>\n<p>After a scoreless first half, the Gauchos came out firing in the second half and controlled much of the match. Boyoko gave the raucous crowd reason to celebrate in the 61st minute when he sent freshman midfielder Drew Murphy’s corner kick into the back of the net with a beautiful header in traffic to give UCSB a 1-0 lead.</p>\n<p>Boyoko was not done however, as he helped UCSB gain a 2-0 advantage in the 86th minute to ice the game. Junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez sent a through ball to Boyoko who then crossed it to Charlie Miller as the sophomore forward sent a shot past a diving Cal Poly goalkeeper to ensure UCSB would come away victorious on such a special night.</p>\n<p>“The fans did a great job coming out, and so we came prepared to make sure we got a win and to enjoy the moment,” senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “It’s not every time that you get that kind of atmosphere. We really appreciate the opportunity and we felt this was a moment we had to get the win to enjoy with our fans.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly lost its second consecutive match and finished in third place in the Big West North. The Mustangs will play at Cal State Northridge Tuesday in the Big West Conference Quarterfinals.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara receives a first-round bye as North Division Champions and will host the winner of Cal Poly and Northridge on Friday in the Big West Semifinals.</p>\n<p>In what has already been an incredible and historic season for UCSB, the Gauchos have a chance to further assert their dominance in the conference in the tournament. Saturday night was a time of celebration for Santa Barbara, and now they must prepare to further extend its 11-game undefeated streak.</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts a Big West semifinal match on Friday at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 12th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Eric Swenson of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52903\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52903\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/ucsb-defeats-rival-cal-poly-in-tv-game/","id":1565,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1564,1563,1562],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Blue-Green Rivalry Part Two","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-29.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-29.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB faces rival Cal Poly in a televised match.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><em></em>Anytime UCSB and Cal Poly meet up on the pitch, excitement and madness are guaranteed to ensue.

With that many fans in attendance, Blue-Green rivalry games are always noted for the booming crowds and hectic cheers aimed at the rival team.</p>\n<p>“It’s very important [to win] because we know we are a better team than them and we have to show that on Saturday,” Jome said. “A win against them, in hopefully a packed Harder Stadium, is the perfect way to end our regular season heading into the Big West Tournament.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also has an opportunity to become the second team in history to finish a Big West season undefeated in conference play if they can win or tie against Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We’re obviously undefeated so we want to go into that game and make sure we take care of business, get the three points and then we’ll move on from there,” senior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “So far it’s good, we’re still undefeated nine games in now.”</p>\n<p>With a victory or tie on Saturday, UCSB would also have home field advantage throughout the Big West Conference Tournament, clinching the top record in the entire conference.</p>\n<p>By clinching the Big West North, Santa Barbara has already secured a first round bye in the Big West tournament as well as home field advantage through the semifinals.</p>\n<p>Despite a scoreless draw against Sacramento State on Wednesday, the third-straight tie for UCSB, the Gauchos are primed to enter the NCAA postseason once again this year, regardless of the results of the conference tournament.</p>\n<p>“It was tough. We wanted to go out there and beat Sac State to get our RPI high and everything,” Baiden said. “We didn’t lose but at the same time we wanted a win against Sac State.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s match features some high scoring offenses as Cal Poly leads the entire nation in goals scored and features a deadly weapon in senior forward Mackenzie Pridham who ranks second in the nation with 14 goals this season.</p>\n<p>When UCSB faced Cal Poly earlier this season, the Gauchos’ defense held Pridham scoreless in an impressive defensive effort by freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the ball, UCSB ranks third in the Big West in goals scored, but is well suited to slow down Cal Poly as the top ranked defense in the league, allowing only 16 goals this season. The Mustangs, however, rank last in the conference with 28 goals allowed.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be an important game for both teams,” Baiden said. “We lost against them last year so we’re going to make sure we don’t repeat that. We’re going for the win and trying to finish the season strong, going undefeated and winning against Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s Blue-Green Rivalry at Harder Stadium is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. and will be televised on Fox Sports West.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 6 of November 7, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52850\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52850\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-07/blue-green-rivalry-part-two/","id":1594,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1593,1592,1591],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tries for Eighth Straight vs. Sac St.","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-31.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/UCSB-Mens-Soccer-9.29.2013-Peter-Vandenbelt-31.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB travels North to take on Sac State","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 5 UCSB men’s soccer team travels to face Sacramento State today with a chance to clinch the Big West outright with a victory.

The Hornets have given up the most goals in the conference with 27 allowed this season; a recipe for disaster when considering UCSB ranks third in the Big West with 27 goals scored this season.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is coming off a 1-1 draw against UC Davis, a result that extended the Gauchos unbeaten streak to nine games and kept their conference recorded undefeated.</p>\n<p>Sac State has dropped seven of its last eight matches, accumulating only one victory in conference play. Last time out, Sac State was trounced 4-2 by Cal Poly, and although the Hornets lost, it was the first time all season they scored more than one goal in a match. The Hornets rank last in the Big West with 11 goals scored in 16 games this season.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we can get on top of them early and stay on top of them,” Vom Steeg said. “What we’re looking for is a really solid game on Wednesday where we put our defense and offense together, play a complete game and come out with a win.”</p>\n<p>With one of the highest RPI rankings in the country, the Gauchos case for postseason play beyond the conference tournament looks strong. Another victory Wednesday will only solidify UCSB’s place in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>UCSB will however enter the game shorthanded. Freshman midfielder Paul Ehmann must sit out the contest due to accumulating five yellow cards this season. Injuries have also taken a toll on the Gauchos as senior defender Peter Schmetz is out for the near future and senior forward and leading goal scorer Achille Campion is questionable for the game.</p>\n<p>“I think every Big West game is a challenge. Out of the eight Big West games that we’ve played, I think we’ve been behind in six of them,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s not what we want to do, but we are just having to battle our way all the way until the end of the season. I just wouldn’t be surprised if Wednesday isn’t any different; we’re going to have to battle our way through Wednesday’s game, and once again, like we’ve been doing, find a way to win.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff Wednesday is scheduled for 2 p.m. at Hornet Soccer Field.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52829\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52829\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/ucsb-tries-for-eighth-straight-vs-sac-st/","id":1590,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1589,1588,1587],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Despite Offensive Struggles, Patriots Showed Potential vs. Steelers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Patriots-sports.jpeg?resize=329%2C153&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Patriots-sports.jpeg?resize=329%2C153&ssl=1","description":"NFL column","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>When examining the New England Patriots’ 7-2 record, most would assume they have been the same old offensive juggernauts they have always been.</p>\n<p>However, before this week’s 55-31 trouncing of the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England’s offense, and Tom Brady specifically, struggled to put points on the board.

Brady topped 300 yards once in the first eight games and never threw more than two touchdown passes in any one game.</p>\n<p>With Gronk and Amendola fully healthy, Brady no longer had to rely on the likes of Julian Edelman, undrafted rookie Kenbrell Thompkins and Aaron Dobson to be the primary pass catchers. Dobson has proven to be a valuable rookie receiver and will blossom now that defenders’ focus will shift to Amendola and Gronkowski.</p>\n<p>Amendola is one of the top slot receivers in the game and his shiftiness and ability to create space gives Brady plenty of options in the middle of the field. Gronkowski is as deadly of a weapon deep and in the middle as anyone in the game and Dobson has showed signs as a dangerous deep threat with breakaway speed.</p>\n<p>Add in a versatile Edelman and a balanced running attack with weapons such as Stevan Ridley and the injured, but expected to return soon, Shane Vereen, and the Patriots maintain a balanced and dangerous offensive attack. Defenses will certainly have trouble slowing down the many options Brady has at his disposal.</p>\n<p>Some may question how much merit can be put into New England’s offensive performance against a lowly Steelers squad that has struggled mightily this season. Sure, New England’s 610-yard performance (the third-most in franchise history) may have been aided by Pittsburgh’s defensive ineptitude. But give credit where it is due: The Patriots were absolutely dominant on Sunday, and any offense that features Tom Brady throwing to such formidable targets as Gronkowski and Amendola can’t be as bad as what the Patriots put on the field early this season.</p>\n<p>Despite their offensive struggles, New England has still found a way to win, entering the halfway point of the season atop the AFC East standings and holding the fourth-best record in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Barring further injury to offensive personnel, the Patriots are once again positioned for a run at Super Bowl title. Other teams such as Kansas City and Denver may have performed better up to this point in the season, but New England presents as dangerous an option as any to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl. The Patriots are on a short list of teams that can realistically challenge the Broncos as the expected AFC Super Bowl representative.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52805\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52805\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-05/despite-offensive-struggles-patriots-showed-potential-vs-steelers/","id":3232,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3231,3230,3229],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fight to Draw Against UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mens-soccer-v-UCD_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mens-soccer-v-UCD_Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB extended its unbeaten streak to nine games with the draw.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After not registering a draw in its first 15 matches of the season, the No. 7 UCSB men’s soccer team concluded Saturday night’s game at Harder Stadium with its second consecutive draw in a 1-1 decision against UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Saturday’s draw brings Santa Barbara’s record to 11-4-2 on the season with an undefeated 6-0-2 conference mark.

Senior defender Peter Schmetz and senior forward Achille Campion both missed the contest due to injury, while freshman midfielder Drew Murphy had to sit out because of the five yellow cards he has totaled this season.</p>\n<p>Shorthanded, the Gauchos had to rely on its depth to provide a difference maker in this match, something that never came for UCSB as both teams entered the half scoreless.</p>\n<p>“I think it was pretty evident we just didn’t have the same push as we normally would. I also thought the team, after a kind of lackluster first half, we actually played pretty well in the second half and I thought we had good energy. We wore them down.”</p>\n<p>Davis struck first in a more exciting second half with a 71st minute goal from junior forward Matt Sheldon.</p>\n<p>UCSB quickly responded, however, as sophomore Charlie Miller’s 82nd minute header kept the Gauchos undefeated streak in tact. It was Miller’s third goal of the season, which is tied for third on the team. Junior defender Kevin Garcia-Lopez and senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko each assisted on the play.</p>\n<p>Neither team could convert in the two overtime periods, as UCSB had to settle for its second straight draw. When UCSB faced Davis earlier in the season, the Gauchos emerged with a 2-1 victory in double overtime playing up North.</p>\n<p>Overall, UCSB outshot Davis 14-11 but the Aggies maintained a 5-4 advantage in shots on goal. Freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely made four saves for the Gauchos, while Miller led UCSB with four shots and three on goal coming off the bench.</p>\n<p>With the Big West North Division title already locked up, the Gauchos are battling to secure the top spot in the entire conference and position themselves to secure a NCAA postseason bid regardless of the Big West Tournament results.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t lose, we haven’t lost in the month of October, so we just have to take the positives out of it,” Vom Steeg said. “We have to kind of regroup a little bit and again find a way to win the next game.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to Sacramento State on Wednesday for a 2 p.m. match.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 4, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52757\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52757\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-04/gauchos-fight-to-draw-against-uc-davis/","id":1591,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1590,1589,1588],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":14,"route":"/authors/72"}},"__N_SSG":true}
