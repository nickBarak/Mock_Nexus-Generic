The Gauchos dropped back-to-back matches in overtime against New Mexico and Stanford before shutting out LMU, ensuring they enter conference play in a winning fashion with a 5-4 overall record.</p>\n<p>Fullerton, meanwhile, enters Friday’s game as the Big West team with the most losses this season with a 3-5 record. The Titans, however, have won their previous two games, outscoring their opponents by a margin of 6-2.</p>\n<p>“I think they have good attacking players, and you know, Big West Conference means that you can kind of throw out preseason; it just starts again,” Vom Steeg said. “We have to build on what we’ve done the last week and a half. For us, and for everybody, it all starts on Friday. And whether it’s Northridge or Fullerton, we have to play well to win games.”</p>\n<p>Likely to lead the Gauchos’ offensive attack this weekend will be a pair of seniors from France, in midfielder Goffin Boyoko and forward Achille Campion. Boyoko ranks first on the team and fifth in the conference with four goals scored this season, while Campion recorded three goals. Assisting the two will be freshman forward Ismaila Jome, who leads UCSB in assists with four, a mark tied for third in the conference.</p>\n<p>While goals have been hard to come by for the Gauchos in nonconference, UCSB cannot afford to play at the same level in the Big West, which features No. 6 Northridge and No. 25 Irvine.</p>\n<p>“We have some players who are going to have to step up for us on Friday if we’re going to have a successful run at the conference,” Vom Steeg said. “In general, I think we need every player to play well. I think the league is good enough, and I don’t think anyone is that talented where a team can have two or three players take a night off and still win the game.”</p>\n<p>After the Gauchos face Fullerton on Friday, they must immediately prep for UC Riverside on Sunday night, a squad that has given Santa Barbara fits in the past.</p>\n<p>“Each time we’ve played them, it seems like we have something missing. They’re a team that has been tough to play against because of the style of play,” Vom Steeg said. “They’re a team in the 4-5-1; they defend, they breakout and for some reason we just have not been able to stamp the game and put them away. Every year that we’ve kept them around, they’ve come back to hurt us.”</p>\n<p>Riverside enters Big West play with a 5-2-2 record, yet has lost its last two games by a combined 5-0 margin. The Highlanders will play at Cal Poly Friday night in their Big West opener before traveling to Santa Barbara for Sunday’s match.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited by the fact that we’re playing Riverside at our place,” Vom Steeg said. “I think Riverside is probably the toughest place to play in the conference. So the fact that we only play them once and we play that game at UCSB is very good.”</p>\n<p>In order for the Gauchos to accomplish their goal of winning the Big West North, they will undoubtedly have to open conference play with a victory, especially considering there are only 10 conference games, with each team splitting the games between home and away.</p>\n<p>“The good news is that if you do reach that goal, it means you’re going to have a real good chance to reach the postseason. It’s going to be very, very competitive,” Vom Steeg said. “Whichever team is the most consistent, whichever team is able to come away with some tough wins or at least get a tough win on the road is going to be the team that comes out on top.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff for Friday night’s game against Fullerton is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at Harder Stadium, while Sunday against Riverside is set for a 5 p.m. start time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of Oct. 3r’d print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52316\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52316\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-03/now-is-when-it-counts/","id":1603,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1602,1601,1600],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sacramento Kings Build Momentum at UCSB","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Sacramento Kings opened training camp at UCSB Tuesday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_52281\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52281\" data-attachment-id=\"52281\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-build-momentum-at-ucsb/attachment/127/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?fit=3888%2C2592&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3888,2592\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1380630707\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"17\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0166666666667\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"127\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127.jpg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-52281\" alt=\"127\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/127-1024x682.jpg?resize=610%2C406\" width=\"610\" height=\"406\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-52281\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Sacramento Kings started their 2013-2014 season at UCSB yesterday.

Hopefully this is an opportunity for us to bond, unite and build the chemistry and trust you need. This is a great facility at UCSB, a great city and I think all of our guys are pretty happy to be here.”</p>\n<p>According to Director of Public Relations Chris Clark , the location for the Kings training camp was between Santa Barbara and one other location. However, when Kings Staff checked the site in August, they decided UCSB was the perfect place.</p>\n<p>“You’re always looking for somewhere that can relax your guys,” Clark said. “It’s a long season, 82 games. Santa Barbara gives us the chance to come to a beautiful locale, good weather and good facilities. When you combine all those things, it was an easy decision.”</p>\n<p>Sacramento will be conducting training camp at UCSB until Sunday, Oct. 6 at which point they will travel to face Golden State in their first preseason game of the season Oct. 7.</p>\n<p>Golden State may be a familiar opponent to many members of the Kings, as Malone was an assistant with the Warriors during last season’s impressive campaign.</p>\n<p>Other members of the Kings’ front office that hold ties to the Warriors community include advisor Chris Mullin (Warriors’ Hall of Famer and former GM), owner Vivek Ranadive (former part-owner of Warriors) and General Manager Pete D’Alessandro (former Warriors’ assistant GM).</p>\n<p>“Obviously I was a part of [the Warriors] the last two years,” Malone said. “We wish them well, but we’re doing our own thing. This is about the Sacramento Kings. It’s just a new day for Sacramento and the fact that a lot of people came up from the bay is just a coincidence.”</p>\n<p>After undergoing much turmoil in the form of ownership issues and a possible relocation to Seattle in previous seasons, the Kings can finally get away from all the off-court drama associated with the franchise and focus back on the court.</p>\n<p>“Not having you guys have to ask me if we’re going to be staying this year is definitely good and it’s great for the fans too,” forward Jason Thompson said. “On the court, the mindset has changed too. We’re going to be a defensive team that can get out and score. We’ll be a fun team to watch.”</p>\n<p>With a new era under Malone comes a new style of play, which looks to dramatically improve on the defensive end for a team that ranked last in points allowed per game last season by a large margin.</p>\n<p>“I want to defend and from the defense, everything else will come,” Malone said. “We still want to run, but we want to run with discipline. None of that will happen if we don’t commit to defending and rebounding at a high level.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, the new regime wants a more unselfish style of play, as evidenced by the team’s move to send Tyreke Evans to New Orleans in exchange for point guard Greivis Vasquez, who ranked third in the NBA last season with 9.0 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Combined with fellow point guard Isaiah Thomas, the Kings look set at a position that was so often reliant on the shoot-first Evans.</p>\n<p>“What I loved today was that [we had] two highly competitive players fighting for a starting job pushing each other,” Malone said. “We have two very talented point guards that will hopefully lead us to a lot of wins this year.”</p>\n<p>Headlining the Kings is center DeMarcus Cousins, who was recently signed to a four-year $62 million deal that clearly shows the team’s trust in Cousins to become the franchise player that will once again lead them to the postseason.</p>\n<p>Other notable players in attendance include John Salmons, Thomas, Marcus Thornton, Ben McLemore and Jason Thompson.</p>\n<p>Now that a new season has arrived for a franchise with a much changed makeup, the Kings will try and improve upon last season’s 28-54 record and possibly contend for a playoff spot in the ultra-competitive Western Conference.</p>\n<p>“Obviously the goal is to make the playoffs,” Guard Jimmer Fredette said. “We want to move forward as an organization and as a team and get better each and every day.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara certainly seems like the perfect place for a franchise searching for a fresh start and if the vibe from the Kings training camp is any indication, a little bit of Santa Barbara may be just what the Kings needed to start off the season on a high note.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 3 of October 2, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kristen Henneman of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Usual playoff contenders such as the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers are winless, while some usual cellar dwellers such as the Miami Dolphins are finding ways to win. Perhaps the most surprising start this season has been the resurgence of the Kansas City Chiefs under new Head Coach Andy Reid. Sparked by a stellar defense, the Chiefs look like they may be in contention for a playoff spot in the AFC.</p>\n<p>While it would take a miracle for the Chiefs to surpass the high-powered Denver Broncos, Kansas City certainly looks capable of securing a wild card spot, especially with a 4-0 record already on the season. When examining the schedule, naysayers may note that the Chiefs have yet to beat any team of merit this season, but at times, the Chiefs look straight up dominant.</p>\n<p>For Kansas City, it all starts on the defensive end. The Chiefs lead the NFL in points allowed, surrendering just over 10 points per game. To put that in perspective, if the Chiefs were to maintain that average the entire season, they would narrowly edge out the 2000 Ravens for fewest points allowed in a 16-game season. While that mark is almost undoubtedly sure to rise for KC, there is still no denying the fact that its defense has been a revelation this season.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Third-year outside linebacker Justin Houston started the year on fire, registering an NFL high 7.5 sacks this season and almost equaling his career-high 10-sack mark he set during last season’s Pro Bowl campaign. Houston may not be able to keep up the same sack pace this season, but he certainly looks like he is capable of registering 15-plus sacks on the season for the Chiefs’ solid front seven, which leads the NFL with 18 sacks this season.</p>\n<p>The strength of the Chiefs’ defense certainly seems to be its linebacking corps. Houston and veterans Tamba Hali and Derrick Johnson form an intimidating trio to go along with a solid fourth linebacker in Akeem Jordan, who is usually pulled when the team switches from its base 3-4 defense to a nickel to defend the pass.</p>\n<p>Hali and Houston provide tremendous quarterback pressure from the edges while Johnson is a more do-it-all type of linebacker, as evidenced by his three-straight 100-plus tackle seasons. The defensive line may not add a whole lot, aside from nose tackle Dontari Poe, who has 3.5 sacks this season, but the Chiefs’ front seven has the looks of a young but promising defense.</p>\n<p>Kansas City’s secondary, meanwhile, has put up extremely strong numbers to start the season, allowing fewer than 190 passing yards per game this season. Much of that success can be attributed to the pressure the front seven has managed to place on opposing quarterbacks, but the secondary deserves similar credit as well. Headlined by safety Eric Berry, this young and aggressive secondary has proven capable of shutting down high-powered passing attacks such as the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles.</p>\n<p>With the eldest starting defensive back (Brandon Flowers) at 27 years old, this Chiefs’ secondary certainly has shown it is willing to grow together and become one of the more consistent and dangerous units in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Andy Reid has revitalized this Chiefs franchise into a legitimate playoff contender in just one year and deserves much of the credit due to his leadership style. Sure, the Chiefs could flame out similar to last season’s Arizona Cardinals, but this Kansas City team has the looks of a playoff team with a strong defense to go along with a veteran quarterback who has many dangerous offensive weapons at his disposal.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing the Chiefs have on the offensive side of the ball, it is speed. Running back Jamaal Charles is arguably the fastest back in the NFL, and he has proven dangerous in both the running and passing game throughout his career. Wide receivers Donnie Avery and Dexter McCluster also possess that breakaway speed that allows the Chiefs to stretch the field, while Dwayne Bowe is the big target over the middle for Alex Smith.</p>\n<p>Smith may not have felt the love in San Francisco, but he is doing a fine job finding his weapons in the open field and staying efficient in the process. His 7:2 touchdown-to-interception ratio is amongst the best in the league, and Smith has continually proven dangerous with his arm and legs, tools that constantly allow him to avoid pressure from opposing defenses. Smith may not be a quarterback that can lead the Chiefs to the Super Bowl, but he is a veteran and is off to a great start this season.</p>\n<p>Look for the Chiefs to continue winning games this season and to at least challenge Denver’s clinching of the AFC West by Week 12 of the season. I’m predicting an 11-win season for a Chiefs team that finished last season with the worst record in the NFL.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fantasy Football</p>\n<p>I’ll be honest, it has been a tough start in fantasy football for me this season. Some of the guys I thought were going to have really big years (C.J. Spiller in particular) have gotten off to slow starts. Nonetheless, my team is surviving through injuries to Danny Amendola, Rob Gronkowski and Roddy White, so I’m still holding out hope.</p>\n<p>However, along with the struggling veterans come exciting breakout players that have been fantasy all-starts throughout the first four weeks. Here are my fantasy breakout stars of the first quarter of the NFL season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Quarterback: Philip Rivers, San Diego Chargers</p>\n<p>As weird as it is to say, Rivers has been one of the better quarterbacks to start this 2013 season. Only Peyton Manning tops his 11:2 touchdown to interception ratio, and Rivers ranks second in the league behind only Manning in quarterback rating as well. Rivers is finding ways to put the ball in the end zone and avoid the costly turnovers fans have come to expect from him. He is a solid starting quarterback option any time he takes the field, and with matchups against Oakland and Jacksonville looming in weeks five and seven, there is no better time to ride the hot hand with Rivers than now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Running Back: Reggie Bush, Detroit Lions</p>\n<p>Bush is finally showing why he was so highly prized coming out of USC eight years ago. While he was reliable the last two seasons while in Miami, Bush has proven deadly thus far in Detroit. Matthew Stafford gets him the ball regularly out of the backfield, and Bush is perhaps the biggest dual-threat back this season in terms of both rushing and receiving. If he can stay healthy, Bush will continue to be a focal point of the Lions’ offensive attack and rack up a monster fantasy season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Wide Receiver: Pierre Garçon, Washington Redskins</p>\n<p>There may have been better breakout options than Garçon at the wideout position, but you can’t argue the type of year he is having. Garçon has recorded at least six receptions in all four games this season and looks like the most dangerous weapon that Robert Griffin III has at his disposal. If the Redskins can get back to any of the same offensive production they had last season, Garçon will continue to build upon his already promising year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tight End: Jordan Cameron, Cleveland Browns</p>\n<p>Anyone who drafted and started Cameron this season knows they potentially picked up the biggest steal of the season. While he has cracked 100 receiving yards only once this season, Cameron already has five touchdown receptions and has scored 15 or more points in three of four weeks. Despite the Browns’ quarterback deficiencies, Cameron will remain a threat in the red zone, thus racking up touchdowns for the rest of the year. He has been a stud at the tight end position this season, rivaled only by Jimmy Graham in terms of consistency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Defense: Kansas City Chiefs</p>\n<p>The Chiefs have posted 20-point fantasy performances three times this season and look like a top-tier option and must-add for any owner. Add their league-leading 18 sacks to five interceptions and seven fumble recoveries and it is no wonder the Chiefs’ defense is lighting it up on a weekly basis. Keep in mind they also get to play the Raiders twice this season, so expect them to continue to put up great numbers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Emily Zhang of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52248\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52248\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-01/kansas-city-chiefs-contender-or-pretender/","id":3226,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[3225,3224,3223],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Split Pair of Weekend Matches","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_Soccer_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M_Soccer_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Playing its first two games at home since the beginning of classes, the UCSB men’s soccer team split a pair of matches over the weekend.

The Gauchos dropped a 2-1 heartbreaker to Stanford in overtime on Friday before rebounding with a 1-0 victory over Loyola Marymount on Sunday night to improve to 5-4 this year.</p>\n<p>“[The victory] was much needed, especially the way we got it, because there were some heartbreaks the last two games,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I think it was important for us morale wise and psyche wise. Obviously we’re very encouraged by today’s result.”</p>\n<p>Sunday night’s victory over LMU (4-2-1) featured an aggressive Gauchos’ offensive attack that outshot the Lions 17-11 with a 9-4 advantage in shots on goal. UCSB was unable to translate all the scoring opportunities into goals and went into halftime scoreless.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Senior midfielder Goffin Boyoko changed that in the 50th minute when he sent a ball to the far post past the outstretching arm of the goalkeeper for his fourth goal of the season. Sophomore defender Marshall Cazares and freshman forward Ismaila Jome each received assists on the play, Jome’s team leading fourth this season.</p>\n<p>Senior forward Achille Campion led UCSB with three shots on goal while Jome contributed two. Jome is quickly becoming a dangerous weapon for the Gauchos and is one of five freshmen starting for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“[Jome] just gets on everything. The thing about him is he competes, he’s fearless,” Vom Steeg said. “You look at a player like that and there’s no reason he shouldn’t potentially be the freshman of the year in the conference.”</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Paul Ehmann received a red card in the 89th minute, forcing the Gauchos to play a man down for the remaining minute plus. Luckily, a Lions’ comeback never materialized. Freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely posted his second career shutout Sunday.</p>\n<p>“We had 17 shots and we were dangerous. It was the first time we scored where we actually passed four times next to each other,” Vom Steeg said. “I thought all that was promising. At the end of the day we got the result we needed tonight. It was an important win going into league.”</p>\n<p>Friday’s highly anticipated match against Stanford (5-1-1) proved to be entertaining for the 7,750 fans in attendance. Tied at one apiece and in overtime, Stanford used the second goal of the day from freshman forward Jordan Morris in the 95th minute to clinch the victory.</p>\n<p>Morris scored in the 31st minute to give Stanford a 1-0 lead before senior defender Peter Schmetz scored his first goal of the season in the 53rd minute to tie the game and ultimately send it to overtime. Ehmann and sophomore forward Charlie Miller were credited with assists on the goal by Schmetz.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s offense struggled to convert opportunities into goals, a clear theme thus far in the season. The Gauchos outshot Stanford 12-8 with a 6-4 advantage in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>“I was a little bit frustrated after the Stanford game because I had a chance after four minutes and I missed it,” Boyoko said. “We have the chances, we just need to shoot on target and make the keeper make the save.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos open conference play on Friday when they host Cal State Fullerton. Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of September 30, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52223\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52223\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-30/gauchos-split-pair-of-weekend-matches/","id":1599,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1598,1597,1596],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Friday Night: It’s Going to Be Loco","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M-Soccer-by-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/M-Soccer-by-Cedar-Lay.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Don't miss the Gauchos take on Stanford this Friday night in the first home game of the year.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB is an exciting place to go to school, but there are few events every year that really get the students going, more so than usual. Friday night is going to be one of those eventful nights as the UCSB men’s soccer team is set to face Stanford at Harder Stadium where record crowds are expected.<br>\nTraditionally, the first soccer home game after students move in is always a must-go event. This year is no exception as the Gauchos take on a prominent opponent in the Cardinal, and all of campus is abuzz in anticipation of Friday night’s match.<br>\n“Everyone is fired up for this game,” senior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “Anytime we have a game at Harder Stadium it’s like we have this switch on. We receive most of our energy from the crowd.”<br>\nEntering the contest with a 4-3 record, UCSB must face a tough Stanford squad (4-1-1 on the season) that is set to spoil what looks to be one of the marquee matchups for the Gauchos this season.<br>\nThe last time UCSB faced such a well-known team on the first game following student move in was back in 2010 when the Gauchos set an NCAA on-campus record with 15,896 fans in attendance in a 2-0 victory against UCLA. Record crowds make sense when factoring in that UCSB has led the nation in attendance for six consecutive seasons.<br>\n“Friday is a huge game for us, and it’s one of the games that we need to have to keep our season going forward,” Baiden said. “Looking back on the UCLA game, it was really, really great to play under that crowd and it gives us that extra edge to go extra hard and play well. It’s going to be good for us in terms of energy, in terms of confidence, in terms of giving it all on the field.”                                                  Despite falling to New Mexico 1-0 and allowing a goal with 12 seconds left to play in overtime, the Gauchos are playing well and that all starts on the defensive side of the ball. Baiden stars alongside a trio of senior defenders in Peter Schmetz, Daniel Welsh and Matt Glodack to form a stingy backline that has allowed seven goals in seven games this season.<br>\nWith freshman goalkeeper Josh McNeely in between the posts, UCSB’s defense has allowed one goal each of the last four games, with McNeely allowing a mere four goals in five starts.<br>\nWhile defense has been key for the Gauchos, the offensive production has seen rocky moments at times this season. Despite the efforts of a pair of seniors in forward Achille Campion and Goffin Boyoko, the Gaucho offense has failed to score in three separate occasions, the team’s only losses of the year. Campion and Boyoko are tied for the team lead in goals with three apiece.<br>\n“We have five freshmen who have been starting. We lost a lot of the goals that were scored last year, those players graduated or became professional players,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “We’re having to find a different way of scoring this year and it has just taken some time. The younger players have gotten better every single game and we’re hoping that our seniors start to become consistently dangerous in front of the net.”<br>\nStanford, meanwhile, has won four straight, allowing one goal during that span. The Cardinal are led by senior goalkeeper Drew Hutchins who has allowed six goals in six starts, and are paced on the offensive end by junior forward Zach Batteer, as he has scored an impressive four of Stanford’s nine goals.<br>\nEven when considering Stanford’s talent on both sides of the ball, UCSB seems less dependent on talent and more so on energy that will fuel the team’s confidence entering Friday night.<br>\n“There’s just very few events that happen at UCSB where everyone can show up to one place,” Vom Steeg said. “It’s the one event where everyone at UCSB can come out and throw on a yellow shirt and cheer on our team. I think that makes the event special, it’s what makes UCSB special.”<br>\nOne thing is clear about the UCSB men’s soccer team entering Friday night. They want every single member of the UCSB community in attendance when they take the field against Stanford. It is, after all, another chance to make history.<br>\n“This is one of those moments where everyone can come together and cheer for our school and cheer for us to win the game. I would basically tell everyone don’t miss it,” Vom Steeg said. “Anyone who was at the UCLA game three years ago probably wishes there were more events like that because obviously that was a real special night. You want to be a part of that.”<br>\nFriday’s epic match is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at Harder.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on pages 1 and 8 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cedar Lay of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52051\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52051\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/friday-night-its-going-to-be-loco/","id":1623,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1622,1621,1620],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sports Editors’ Welcome: Paul-Michael Ochoa","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Editors-Welcome-Art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Editors-Welcome-Art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sports Editor Paul-Michael Ochoa shares what he loves most about UCSB (including our institutionalized hatred of Cal Poly).

Partying isn’t for everyone, but who needs partying when you have beautiful people, beaches and mountains surrounding you everywhere you look.</p>\n<p>During my three years as a Gaucho thus far, I can say I have changed tremendously as a person. College is the time when you are supposed to have fun and make some mistakes, it is just a matter of keeping those mistakes to a minimum and making sure they never get in the way of your future endeavors.</p>\n<p>Through experiences with the <em>Nexus</em> (which you should read everyday) and my business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi (which you should all rush this fall), I’ve learned hard work pays off in big ways. Join clubs, experience new things and enjoy the shit out of life in college.</p>\n<p>Go to UCSB athletic events and cheer on the Gauchos because it is truly something special to call yourself one. And I better see all of you on Friday at Harder Stadium! The first soccer game of the year is always fun and whether you decide to go sober or drunk out of your mind, make sure you cheer for our team.</p>\n<p>The Thunderdome can truly be thunderous when students pack the stands, but it is up to us as Gauchos to bring the party wherever we go. Hold that fun, yet driven atmosphere through all phases of life and never forget the way you felt as Gauchos during college.</p>\n<p>And learn how to hate Cal Poly. We are superior in pretty much any way you can think of. Better looking students? Check. Better athletic teams and academics? Check. Better party scene and surrounding nature? Without a question.</p>\n<p>All I can say entering my senior year is, enjoy your time in the most beautiful place to attend college because before you know it, it will be gone. Be proud to be a Gaucho. Enjoy this year and I’ll catch all you beautiful people on Del Playa.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Here’s to a rowdy year,</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Paul-Michael</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of </em>the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52055\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52055\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome-paul-michael-ochoa/","id":2095,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[2094,2093,2092],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Ready to Reclaim Big West Crown","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/JakeCollins_MSoccer_100512_302.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/JakeCollins_MSoccer_100512_302.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After missing the postseason for the first time in six seasons after injuries rattled the squad, the UCSB men’s soccer team looks to once again return to its place atop the Big West Conference this ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After missing the postseason for the first time in six seasons after injuries rattled the squad, the UCSB men’s soccer team looks to once again return to its place atop the Big West Conference this season. Picked to finish first in the Big West North Division by the media, the Gauchos enter this season with one goal in mind: Improvement.<br>\n“We have high expectations, but I feel like the expectations are based off of getting the players back who were hurt and the addition of some very, very good young players who I think are going to help us right away,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “I think those two ingredients are going to help us do very well this year.”<br>\nHeadlining the returning Gauchos is senior defensive midfielder Fifi Baiden who garnered All-Big West First Team honors last season. Once again picked by the media as All-Big West in the preseason, Baiden will anchor a defensive backline that will be the strength of the Gauchos this season.<br>\n“Our back line is our strength. We have experience and we’ve played in so many games together,” Baiden said. “It’s actually really good for the team in terms of communicating and helping the new players to settle in with the team. It’s going to be the key for us this year.”<br>\nAlso named as the No. 38 player in the entire country by TopDrawerSoccer.com, Baiden will look to lead the Gauchos this season with his usual defensive oriented play.<br>\n“It’s fun to be recognized and it shows that you’re doing something good,” Baiden said. “My philosophy, personally, I see myself as a team guy. I don’t want to force myself to do anything to hurt the team. Being recognized nationally also gives me the hope that I am not doing a bad job.”<br>\nJoining Baiden on the preseason list for top players nationwide includes senior forward Achille Campion at No. 100. Campion missed much of last year due to injury but will be the focus of the offensive attack this season for Santa Barbara.<br>\n“Our leading goal scorer literally would have been Campion, and of course, he got hurt some games in the season,” Vom Steeg said. “We anticipate him having a real big season for us. [Senior midfielder] Goffin Boyoko is another player who played hurt all last year. He’s another player who will give us goals.”<br>\nWhile defense certainly seems to be the strength for the Gauchos, it will be up to the pair of seniors in Boyoko and Campion, along with a talented group of newcomers to give the offensive attack some new life that was missing last season.<br>\nIncluded in the list of newcomers expected to contribute immediately are junior forward Reed McKenna, a transfer from UCLA, and a pair of freshman in midfielder Paul Ehmann and forward Ismaila Jome.<br>\n“We’re a bigger team (than last season),” Vom Steeg said. “We have a couple of players who can serve the ball very well and I think when you put that mix together, we’re going to be able to get some goals off of set pieces.”<br>\nUCSB plays its first regular season game against No. 19 Northwestern University on Friday in Evanston, Illinois. Kickoff is scheduled for 5 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Jake Collins of</em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51812\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51812\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-08-28/ucsb-ready-to-reclaim-big-west-crown/","id":1626,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[1625,1624,1623],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Alumnus Brian Shaw To Coach Denver Nuggets","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Former UCSB basketball legend Brian Shaw was officially named head coach of the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, his first opportunity to lead a team of his own after coaching in the NBA since 2005.

Shaw has experienced tremendous success as both a player and a coach throughout his career and will now take over a promising young Nuggets’ squad that finished third in the Western Conference last season with 57 wins.</p>\n<p>A native of Oakland, CA, Shaw transferred to UCSB after two seasons at Saint Mary’s College and immediately established himself as one of the best ever to don a Gaucho uniform. Shaw played two seasons at UCSB from 1986-1988 garnering All-Big West honors both seasons. In his senior season, Shaw was named Big West Player of the Year and was also an All-American en route to leading UCSB to its first ever NCAA tournament in 1988.</p>\n<p>Shaw impressed scouts during his time at UCSB and was the Boston Celtics first round draft pick (24th overall) in the 1988 NBA Draft. During his 14-year playing career in the NBA, Shaw played both point and shooting guard for seven different teams. His best statistical season came in his second year in the NBA, when Shaw averaged 13.8 points, 7.6 assists and 4.7 rebounds in 79 starts for the Celtics.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Perhaps Shaw’s most memorable moments in the NBA came during his final four seasons in the league, which he spent with the Los Angeles Lakers. Shaw helped the Lakers win three consecutive NBA titles from 2000-2002, playing alongside greats such as Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.</p>\n<p>Aside from his professional career in the NBA, Shaw also won a gold medal at the 1986 FIBA World Championships playing for the US national team.</p>\n<p>Following his retirement from the NBA in 2003, Shaw immediately began to work towards a career as a coach, scouting for the Lakers for a season before becoming an assistant coach for the Lakers from 2005-2011. Shaw won two additional championships as an assistant coach for the Lakers from 2009-2010, bringing his NBA title count to five.</p>\n<p>Before accepting the head coaching job with the Nuggets, Shaw spent the previous two seasons as the associate head coach for the Indiana Pacers and helped develop young players such as Roy Hibbert and Paul George. This past season, Shaw tutored fellow Gaucho Orlando Johnson during Johnson’s rookie season in the NBA in which the Pacers fell to the eventual champion Miami Heat in a seven-game Eastern Conference Finals showdown.</p>\n<p>After 14 seasons as a player and eight seasons as an assistant coach, Shaw will finally get to show the NBA why he has been such a commodity on the coaching market the previous four seasons. Shaw replaces the reigning NBA Coach of the Year in George Karl and inherits a young and talented Nuggets’ roster highlighted by players including Ty Lawson, Kenneth Faried and Andre Iguodala.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best player in UCSB history, Shaw continues to sculpt his basketball legacy and will look to have the same success as a head coach that he has had at every stop throughout his impressive career.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"51736\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-06-26/ucsb-professors-elected-to-join-ecological-society-of-america/shaw-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?fit=520%2C282&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,282\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Shaw 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?fit=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?fit=520%2C282&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-51736\" alt=\"Shaw 2\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?resize=312%2C169\" width=\"312\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Shaw-2-1.jpg?resize=250%2C136&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of the June 26th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Taylor as the primary option in the backcourt to go along with rising sophomore Duke DaRe, who received a large amount of playing time at the end of last season.</p>\n<p>Headlining the three new recruits is Zalmico Harmon, a 6’0” point guard coming from Ventura College, where he led the Pirates to the postseason and received First Team All-State honors.</p>\n<p>“His maturity, physically and mentally, is definitely something we need on our team,” Stock said. “That gives him a great chance to make an impact.”</p>\n<p>Along with Harmon, UCSB’s recruiting class includes another point guard in Eric Childress from Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, CA. Childress was named First Team All-CIF as well as Bay League Player of the Year.</p>\n<p>“Eric is a true point guard where he’s a pass-first point guard,” Stock said. “He has great poise and maturity for his age. He’s definitely a guy that will be a huge asset.”</p>\n<p>Rounding out the recruiting class for the Gauchos is 6’10” forward Alex Hart from Kelowna, British Columbia in Canada. Hart averaged over 35 points per game in his senior season for Immaculata Catholic Regional High School and was a member of British Columbia’s U-17 team.</p>\n<p>“The unique thing about Alex is the fact that he can stretch the floor with his shooting ability,” Stock said. “He can stretch the defense and give Al the chance to pound it inside.”</p>\n<p>These three recruits will join a talented roster that includes First Team All-Big West selection in rising junior center Alan Williams, along with the Big West Best Sixth Player of the Year in rising senior guard Kyle Boswell. Rising sophomores in guards John Green and Michael Bryson, as well as forward Taran Brown, are also expected to contribute heavily for another youthful UCSB squad next season.</p>\n<p>“I think all three of [the recruits] have a chance to have an impact,” Stock said. “They all bring such different things to the table and definitely address different needs we have on our team.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of May 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mark Brocher of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51516\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51516\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-22/gauchos-sign-three-standouts-for-2013-14/","id":630,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[629,628,627],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Wide  Open Western Conference: San Antonio is Healthy and Ready to Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kevin-Durant-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kevin-Durant-art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering the NBA postseason it was apparent the Miami Heat was once again the clear favorite to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals.

Last season, five rookie quarterbacks started in the first week of the season. This year, however, there is a lack of elite quarterback prospects, with the majority of the top players in this year’s draft sitting on the defensive side of the ball. Linemen on both sides of the ball will be the story of the 2013 NFL draft. Here is a look at the biggest needs for each of the first 10 teams selecting along with a projected selection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kansas City Chiefs: Luke Joeckel, OT, Texas A&amp;M</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although Kansas City has needs along the defensive line as well, I don’t see the Chiefs passing up a franchise left tackle in Joeckel who currently ranks as the top overall player on most experts’ draft boards. With this pick, Kansas City can solidify the important left tackle position to protect their recent investment in former 49ers quarterback Alex Smith. Joeckel gives the Chiefs a dominant and well-balanced blocker who can give the quarterback time and open up lanes for running back Jamaal Charles.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jacksonville Jaguars: Dion Jordan, DE/OLB, Oregon</p>\n<p>Jacksonville could go a number of ways here but, as has been the sentiment for what seems like the past decade, the Jaguars need help in the pass rush. Jordan is one of the best athletes in this year’s draft and is a proven commodity with his level of production for a successful Oregon program. He can definitely help to improve Jacksonville’s pass rush and switch between defensive end and outside linebacker.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Oakland Raiders: Sharrif Floyd, DT, Florida</p>\n<p>After a few mediocre seasons in which they showed signs of life, Oakland returned to the bottom tier of the NFL once again after a disappointing season. The Raiders have a number of needs and could look at Geno Smith here, but that pick would be a reach so I have them taking Floyd, a dominant run stopping defensive tackle who can help the Raiders bulk up along the defensive line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Philadelphia Eagles: Eric Fisher, OT, Central Michigan</p>\n<p>So much for new head coach Chip Kelly making a giant splash with his first pick in the draft. Pressure is on the Eagles to find a new franchise quarterback in Geno Smith, but Smith would once again be a reach here. Fisher would provide the Eagles with a solid tackle that can play on either the right or the left side and help protect whoever Philadelphia decides to run out at quarterback. Maybe Philly makes a move later in the draft to get Geno.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Detroit Lions: Dee Milliner, CB, Alabama</p>\n<p>Cornerback isn’t the most pressing need for the Lions, but it certainly couldn’t hurt to have a defensive stopper like Milliner, especially in a division where the Lions must face the Packers and Aaron Rodgers twice a season. If Fisher is available here, I think the Lions’ priority is finding pass protectors to keep Matthew Stafford upright and healthy, but, in this case, Milliner is the choice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cleveland Browns: Ezekiel Ansah, DE, BYU</p>\n<p>Ansah is a raw prospect with as much potential as anyone in this year’s draft, but he is somewhat unproven. Cleveland needs help with the pass rush and Ansah seems like the player with the highest potential reward. He is a freak of an athlete that can really help provide the Browns with a defensive presence to create havoc for opposing quarterbacks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Arizona Cardinals: Lane Johnson, OT, Oklahoma</p>\n<p>This draft is full of impressive linemen on both sides of the ball and it shows with the third offensive linemen taken already. Arizona doesn’t need a quarterback now that they have Carson Palmer, so the Cardinals should focus on improving the offensive line. Johnson is the best available prospect in terms of value and need. He may not be as talented as Joeckel or Fisher, but Johnson presents a solid prospect that can help to solidify a weak Arizona line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Buffalo Bills: Chance Warmack, OG, Alabama</p>\n<p>Warmack is one of the most impressive offensive guard prospects in the last several years and will help Buffalo to establish a pretty good offensive line. The Bills could reach for a quarterback here so Ryan Nassib makes sense for Buffalo, but not this early in the draft. Look for Buffalo to address the quarterback situation in the second round or trade up into the later parts of the second round.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New York Jets: Barkevious Mingo, DE/OLB, LSU</p>\n<p>The Jets sucked last year and that mainly falls on the lack of quality quarterback play. Unless the Jets find a match with either one of their two first round picks, they may stick with Mark Sanchez for another season and help to reload what used to be a scary defense. Mingo adds versatility to a Jets defense that is in need of an intimidating pass-rusher, especially when facing Tom Brady twice a season. Without Darrelle Revis, the Jets need to refocus on bringing back that defensive mindset that helped them advance to the AFC Championship two years in a row.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Tennessee Titans: Jonathan Cooper, OG, North Carolina</p>\n<p>Cooper is a more athletic guard than Warmack and can provide the Titans with a solid player to help create room for Chris Johnson. Cooper’s athleticism will prove valuable when he is pulling downfield and setting up blocks for Johnson. Tennessee needs pass rushing help and could look at Star Lotulelei, but the defensive tackle is more of a run-stopping specialist.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overall, I’m projecting five offensive linemen and four defensive linemen to go in the top 10 with the only non-linemen being Dee Milliner. This draft class is obviously rich with linemen on both sides of the ball. I feel that no teams will choose a quarterback in the early parts of the first round and will instead wait to either trade up into the first round or wait until the second round to find their man.</p>\n<p>Quarterback is the most important position in the game, but there is no sense in forcing a pick when there are talented linemen galore available. However the draft shakes out on Thursday, be sure there will be surprises aplenty.

Bryson finished with 14 points and five rebounds while Brown tallied 11 points and eight boards.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s encouraging that [Taran] got some boards,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I think it’s encouraging that he got to the rim and got two dunks. It’s a step up for him.”</p>\n<p>The Titans were unable to slow down UCSB’s inside game as they were outscored 40-14 in the paint. Fullerton sported a four or five guard lineup for the entirety of the game, with its lone forward being 6’7” junior James ‘Deuce’ Douglas.</p>\n<p>Without senior guard D.J. Seeley and senior forward Sammy Yeager, Fullerton’s second and third leading scorers, the Titans looked nothing like the team that entered last night’s game as the eighth team in the nation in points scored per game with 78.4. The Titans’ 50 points is a season low, the previous season low in scoring being 55, which came in a loss to Pacific last weekend.</p>\n<p>“It was different than the first time we played them when they were just running and gunning,” Big Al said. “I think they wanted to save their legs because they didn’t have all their guys; they’re pretty banged up like we are. We played solid, we held them to one shot most of the time and we were able to get out in the break for our advantage.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton featured a usual offense for a high-scoring team, holding the ball at the top of the key, often waiting to attack until only 10 to 15 seconds remained on the shot clock. The Titans ranked either first or second in the conference in the three major shooting percentages entering the contest, but finished with an unusually low .200 three-point shooting percentage, .591 free throw percentage and .354 field goal percentage.</p>\n<p>“When we were disciplined and moved the ball and got great shots … we were pretty effective,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “I had no idea they would come in, hold the ball and go delay. They played fast, but only in the last 15 seconds of the shot clock.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton featured an effective one-man full court press on UCSB’s point guard for the majority of the game, causing nine of the Gauchos’ 14 turnovers in the first half.</p>\n<p>Up 23-22 at the half, UCSB came out aggressive to open the second half, going on a 14-4 run and never trailing in the second half. UCSB outperformed Fullerton on the boards as well, outrebounding the Titans 42-25.</p>\n<p>Senior guard Nate Garth returned to action for UCSB after an eight game absence due to a left hamstring injury, but was limited in action, receiving only one minute of play. He will be the lone senior honored on Saturday for senior night.</p>\n<p>“He just brings a presence that you want to play harder,” Bryson said. “He’s a very smart basketball player, so it makes you want to play harder for him and play smarter. If he’s just with us, we’re going to be a better team.”</p>\n<p>Riverside previously defeated UCSB 54-45 at home, so the Gauchos will look for revenge against the Highlanders with a chance to officially lock up the seventh seed for next week’s Big West Conference Tournament in Anaheim.</p>\n<p>“It’s a new season now,” Big Al said. “We’re going to be happy for about five more minutes and get ready for Riverside on Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Tipoff for Saturday’s contest against Riverside is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1447241361\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50577\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50571\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-08/local-organization-opposes-beach-revamp-asks-county-to-reevalute/mensbasketball_markbrocher_03-07-2013_dsc_1214/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1362687406\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"140\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?fit=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50571\" alt=\"MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214-250x144.jpg?resize=250%2C144\" width=\"250\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?resize=250%2C144&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MensBasketball_MarkBrocher_03.07.2013_DSC_1214.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6>MARK BROCHER/ DAILY NEXUS</h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of March 8th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

With senior night looming, UCSB has a chance to end the regular season with a winning streak before March Madness commences.</p>\n<p>“It’s important for us to build momentum going into the Big West Tournament,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “That’s what this weekend really provides, is an opportunity to hopefully get Nate back on the floor for senior night, to hopefully win two games and build momentum and have a three-game winning streak.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos must first face a dangerous Fullerton squad that has certainly given UCSB fits in the past. The Titans previously defeated UCSB 86-79 on their home floor to open conference play on Dec. 29 and were led by senior forward Sammy Yeager’s 30 points on 8-11 shooting from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“They have some big time scorers on their team,” Boswell said. “We know that their strength is to score the basketball, so … we’ve got to contest shots on the defensive end and we’ll have a good shot at winning.”</p>\n<p>Fullerton currently ranks first in the conference and eighth in the nation, averaging 78.4 points per game. Fullerton is capable of lighting up the scoreboard any night and features the second, third and eighth leading scorers in the conference in senior guards D.J. Seeley and Kwame Vaughn to compliment Yeager.</p>\n<p>“They’re one of the top teams in the nation in terms of scoring the basketball,” Boswell said. “If we can limit their shot attempts and good shots that they get, we’ll be in good shape.”</p>\n<p>UCSB has struggled with injuries for much of the season but is finally looking healthier with Boswell, sophomore center Alan Williams and junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle all returning from injury in the last few weeks. Guard Nate Garth, the team’s lone senior, returned to practice Tuesday and may return to the lineup in time for senior night Saturday.</p>\n<p>Big Al will be the focus for the Gauchos’ offense tonight as Fullerton possesses a lineup full of capable scoring guards but lacks depth in the frontcourt.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to hurt them on the glass, hurt them inside, we need to make them pay for being undersized,” Coach Williams said. “We need to play to our advantage, which should be our strength and our size and how physical we should be inside.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1384689356\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"50535\"><img data-attachment-id=\"50541\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-07/gauchos-battle-for-position-host-titans/magaligauthier_mbasketball_11112-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=300%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"300,520\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.6\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T2i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1351806281\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"135\",\"iso\":\"6400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.001\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=144%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?fit=300%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-50541\" alt=\"MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112 (1)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11-144x250.jpg?resize=144%2C250\" width=\"144\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?resize=144%2C250&amp;ssl=1 144w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-11.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<h6><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em;\">MAGALI GAUTHIER / DAILY NEXUS</span></h6>\n<h6>Senior guard Nate Garth missed eight games with a hamstring injury but returned to practice this week.

While playing time was slow for Johnson in the beginning of the season, he improved his game by playing for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA D-League.</p>\n<p>Soon after he received a shot at playing time, Johnson earned a spot in the rotation thanks to his excellent three-point shooting. Johnson currently leads the Pacers from behind the arc, shooting .500 on the season, a team high.</p>\n<p>“He’s a very good three-point shooter, but he also was swarmed all the time, double-teamed and guarded and he was the focus every game we went into,” Williams said. “Now he’s getting to play on a team that has all-stars on it and a lot of other really good players and he’s a role player that gets to come in. He’s always had great range on his shot.”</p>\n<p>Johnson left UCSB as the school’s all-time leading scorer in just three seasons of play, so it comes as no surprise to Gauchos to see Johnson score. He emerged in Indiana’s rotation in large part to an injury to Danny Granger, eclipsing veterans Gerald Green and Sam Young for time.</p>\n<p>The fact that he is also contributing on a team that is in playoff contention only makes Johnson’s emergence in the NBA that much more impressive. Indiana currently holds a 38-22 record, second best in the Eastern Conference behind only defending champion Miami.</p>\n<p>During the month of February, Johnson averaged 4.6 points and 2.2 rebounds per game while shooting .531 from behind the arc. On Feb. 22, he registered a career-high 14 points and 23 minutes of playing time in a 114-82 victory over the Pistons. Johnson was a perfect 5-5 from the field, including 3-3 from three-point range.</p>\n<p>“Nobody will work harder at their game; nobody will work harder at the trade than Orlando,” Williams said. “He’s not physically going to get a lot better; he’s a big strong man already. Where he’s going to get a lot better is the concepts of the NBA game, how they play it. If that happens, he’s going to get a lot more valuable. I think he’ll always be a role player in the NBA. That’s really valuable and that’s really good if you can be an NBA role player.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 6th, 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50517\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50517\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-06/johnson-making-impact-with-indiana/","id":647,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[646,645,644],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Earns Big West Tournament Berth","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball-file-photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Basketball-file-photo.jpg?resize=400%2C305&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team proved Saturday they could win the pivotal games that can make or break a season.

Northridge, meanwhile, drops to 13-17 overall and 4-13 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[The victory] was pivotal.

Big Al scored 24 in the second half alone and finished 11-20 from the field and 10-13 from the free throw line on the night.</p>\n<p>“It feels good to get in the rhythm of things and to get a little bit of my swagger back,” Big Al said. “It was really fun to be out there; the energy was great from the team.”</p>\n<p>In his first game back from injury, junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle scored a season-high 10 points off the bench with eight coming in the second half. Junior guard Kyle Boswell also scored 18 for the Gauchos, a game after scoring a career-high 27 in Thursday’s loss at Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“The first half, we just missed a lot of layups and open shots; we just couldn’t quite get it in sync,” Coach Williams said. “In the second half, Al, Boswell and Keegan Hornbuckle—the three of them really just took the game over.”</p>\n<p>UCSB used the trio to overpower the Matadors, scoring 54 points in the second half alone. Freshman guard Michael Bryson added 14 points on the night, but kept the Gauchos in the game early with 13 of those points coming in the first half.</p>\n<p>“I feel like we knew we were in control of the game,” Big Al said. “There were just a couple of plays in the first half that could have had us with a lead at halftime. We were just focused in the locker room knowing that we could go out and win this game, all we had to do was execute a little better and we did that as a team.”</p>\n<p>The performances from Boswell and Hornbuckle were especially significant for UCSB as both players are coming back from injuries that left the Gauchos with a depleted squad of only eight eligible players.</p>\n<p>Overall, Santa Barbara looked strong in its victory, outrebounding the Matadors 34-33, committing fewer turnovers (14-13) and shooting a higher percentage from the field (50.8-42.6 percent).</p>\n<p>“Getting back healthy at this time of the year is really important for us,” Big Al said. “Once we get back to full strength, we’ll be a really tough team to beat. We’re looking forward to carrying on this momentum we have right now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home to face Cal State Fullerton on Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><em> A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 4st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50449\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50449\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-03-04/ucsb-earns-big-west-tournament-berth/","id":651,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[650,649,648],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":5,"highestPage":14,"route":"/authors/72"}},"__N_SSG":true}
