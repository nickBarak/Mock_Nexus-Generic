Facing such adversity, the UCSB men’s basketball team will have a chance to make a statement and end a three-game losing skid tonight when they face Hawaii on the road.</p>\n<p>With possibly only eight players eligible to play due to injury, the third youngest team in the nation has struggled in rebounding from injuries to several critical players. UCSB enters tonight’s matchup with an 8-18 overall record and 4-10 mark in conference, while Hawaii is 16-11 on the season and 9-6 in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“[Injuries are] definitely tough in general for any team, but especially for us,” freshman forward Taran Brown said. “We’re such a young team and we haven’t had a lot of chances to handle that kind of adversity. We’ve just got to come together in times like this and push it the rest of the season.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>UCSB previously dropped a 51-50 decision to Sacramento State in the BracketBusters game and must now return to conference play against the third place Warriors. Santa Barbara sits in eighth place in the conference standings, a mere half game ahead of Cal State Northridge for the final slot in the postseason tournament.</p>\n<p>Hawaii, meanwhile, is coming off an 84-50 victory over Northern Arizona that snapped a two-game skid. The last time these two teams met in Santa Barbara, junior forward Christian Standhardinger went off for career-highs with 31 points and 16 rebounds in a 78-73 Hawaii victory.</p>\n<p>“We definitely can’t let him get off,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “We’ve got to do a better job on all their guys inside. We got our rear ends handed to us inside on the glass and we have to fight harder, block out better, and be more physical in keeping them off the glass.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will potentially be without one of its top scorers in junior guard Kyle Boswell, who is sitting out with an injured shoulder. Sophomore center Alan Williams, the team’s leading scorer, rebounder and shot blocker has also only played in two games since returning from a sprained ankle.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have to see how we come out and play and practice,” Coach Williams said. “It was actually kind of impressive after a nine hour travel day they came out and practiced really well. Practice was good, they were feisty, they were competitive; things we want to see.”</p>\n<p>Practice may have been a little too feisty though, as Brown cracked his nose during Tuesday’s practice in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>“I’m definitely in some pain right now,” Brown said. “I’m going to have to wear a mask tomorrow in the game, but I can’t let it hold me back, I’ve got to keep going. At this point we don’t think I broke my nose.”</p>\n<p>As Santa Barbara struggles to rebound from a slow season and tries to clinch a spot in the postseason tournament, maybe a trip to Hawaii is exactly what the Gauchos needed to get them back on track.</p>\n<p>“I like the idea of coming out to Hawaii, getting a smile on our faces and just getting some positive energy,” Brown said. “I think that’s a big thing we need right now with this type of season.”</p>\n<p>Tonight’s tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 28th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50404\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50404\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-28/ucsb-travels-to-hawaii-looking-to-end-skid/","id":650,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[649,648,647],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Hosts Sacramento State in BracketBusters","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Losers of two straight and seven of the last eight games, the UCSB men’s basketball team could not have asked for a nonconference game at a better time.

The Hornets, meanwhile, are also losers of two straight games entering Saturday’s contest at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to use this as an opportunity as a prep game just for the next games coming up, and obviously we’re going to try to get the win too,” freshman forward Taran Brown said. “We all need to get together at a time like this, get our heads right and just keep grinding through it.”</p>\n<p>In order for UCSB to win, they will have to improve upon its recent shooting performances as the Gauchos shot under 26 percent from the field against Riverside. Big Al led UCSB with 15 points and 12 rebounds but was only 4-18 from the field.</p>\n<p>“It all comes down to poor shooting,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “During the game, you shoot the ball at [26] percent, you’re going to have a hard time beating anybody. If you throw on top of that turning the ball over … it still makes it difficult when you do those things.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward John Dickson leads Sac. State with 13.3 points per game and is second on the team with 5.8 rebounds per game. A key to the game will be how the depleted Gauchos slow down Dickson in the paint.</p>\n<p>With only eight players available to play during their last two games, the Gauchos have struggled with injuries all season. There is an outside chance that junior guard Kyle Boswell, the team’s best shooter, could return by Saturday from a shoulder injury, but the odds are still unlikely.</p>\n<p>“Is our confidence shaken at this time? Sure, we’re not playing very well,” Coach Williams said. “I think it’s a residue of how beat up we’ve been and that we’ve really been holding it together with different pieces every game and different guys. It’s a house of cards and it can tumble, and unfortunately [Wednesday] night, offensively, it just tumbled.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s BracketBusters game against Sacramento State is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of February 22nd 2013′s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-22/ucsb-hosts-sacramento-state-in-bracketbusters/","id":640,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[639,638,637],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"More Than Just a Small-Town Boy","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-4.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagaliGauthier_MBasketball_11112-4.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Some of the biggest stars have humble, small-town roots.

Needless to say, growing up in such a small and isolated place certainly helped to shape Brown into the man and player he is today.</p>\n<p>“Everyone kind of knows everyone and that’s kind of how it is in Wyoming,” Brown said. “If you’re a pretty well-known athlete, you kind of just know everyone because it is a small place. There’s not a lot of violence there, so it’s a great place to grow up. I really love Wyoming, especially my hometown.”</p>\n<p>Making it as a basketball player was not always the only dream for Brown. He played football and participated in several track events including hurdles, high jump, long jump and the triple jump up until his sophomore year in high school. Had he continued playing either sport, Brown has no doubt he could have played either at the college level.</p>\n<p>“I quit just to focus on basketball,” Brown said. “I was actually pretty good in both of those and went to state in both of those. It would have been fun to be a college wide receiver, but I think my passion is definitely basketball.”</p>\n<p>While his 6’8” frame would have certainly proven deadly as a wide receiver, where Brown truly excels is in his athletic ability. His ability to shoot and run the floor like a guard with the build of a forward helped him to establish a future beyond playing high school ball at Campbell County High School.</p>\n<p>“It was tough, especially since the population is not too high in Wyoming. There is under a million people, so it’s hard to get recognized for basketball,” Brown said. “We didn’t have [Amateur Athletic Union], so my traveling coaches when I grew up, we all went to tournaments all over just to get my name out there.”</p>\n<p>During high school, Brown stood out on a national stage despite playing in the least populated state in the country. Taran was named a McDonald’s All-American as well as the Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Wyoming. He was also a two-time All-State selection and led Campbell County to a state title during his senior year.</p>\n<p>“[Assistant] Coach [Matt] Stock (a Wyoming native) really deserves credit on [bringing Taran to UCSB] because of the Wyoming connection,” Head Coach Bob Williams said. “He had heard a ton about him and been in touch with him and had been mailing him stuff. I watched him play in Vegas, and from that, that’s when we really started recruiting him. Once he got out here and saw Santa Barbara and all that compared to where he grew up, it was a really nice opportunity for him.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the charm of Santa Barbara lured Brown, a sociology major, away from competing schools such as Colorado State and Wyoming. Last season, Brown, along with Coach Williams, decided to redshirt in order to save a year of eligibility. That decision allowed him to focus on transitioning from Wyoming life to the faster California lifestyle he wasn’t used to.</p>\n<p>“To see his transition was funny. When he first got here he didn’t know a lot of things, didn’t know a lot of California terms, didn’t know a lot of places to go eat and never heard of a lot of things,” sophomore guard T.J. Taylor said. “It was very fun to see him transition from a little Wyoming kid to now, almost a superstar.”</p>\n<p>This season, Brown has shown just how dangerous of a player he can be. With six games left in the regular season, he has already broken the school’s single-season record for three-pointers made in a season by a freshman with 52. That number ranks seventh in the entire Big West Conference. His 11.7 points per game rank third this season for UCSB and are first amongst freshmen in the conference.</p>\n<p>Brown has also shown to be versatile aside from scoring, ranking second on the team in rebounds (5.7), steals (0.9) and blocks (1.0), third in assists (2.2) and first in minutes per game (31.1). He has eclipsed the 20-point mark three times this season and registered a career-high 22 points in only his second game as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“His potential is to the sky, it’s just on him to have the mentality to come into the gym everyday, really working to get better and really believing in himself as well,” Taylor said. “I think he will, with the push from the coaches and his teammates. He can be a superstar. I’m excited to see him grow and become a better player.”</p>\n<p>With his future looking bright at UCSB, Brown’s dreams of playing basketball as a profession are slowly taking shape. Who would have thought that a small-town kid from snowy northeastern Wyoming would one day become the big man on campus at sunny Santa Barbara?</p>\n<p>“Ever since I was five years old, I just started with a ball and had travel leagues from first grade all the way until now. It’s always been my thing and I just really love to play,” Brown said. “When I’m on the court, it just feels like I’m in the right place. I’m going to bring basketball as far as I can. I know I have a ways to go, but anything can happen, so I’m going to keep pushing.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next plays at UC Riverside tonight at 7 p.m.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 13 of February 20th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<h6><em>Photo by Magali Gauthier/Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50244\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50244\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-20/more-than-just-a-small-town-boy/","id":638,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[637,636,635],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Running This Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As the youngest team in the Big West, the UCSB men’s basketball team has shown it can compete with the top teams in the conference.

Earlier in the season, UCSB defeated Cal Poly in an 83-81 double-overtime thriller. Emotions can certainly be expected to be running high when these two teams face off again on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We got some good practices this week, and even though we have a lot of injuries, I feel like a lot of guys are going to be healthy and ready to go by this weekend,” junior guard Kyle Boswell said. “Coming off a big win against Pacific, I feel like we’ve got some momentum rolling and a lot of us are starting to understand what it’s going to take to get some more wins and go on a winning streak in the next few games.”</p>\n<p>Last time out against the Mustangs, Boswell hit what would become a game-winning three-point play with 12 seconds left and scored the Gauchos final six points. Boswell is currently second on the team, averaging 13 points per game, and has switched roles much of the season between a starter and the sixth man.</p>\n<p>“We know playing them the first time that Cal Poly is a scrappy team and they’re talented,” Boswell said. “We’re going to have to bring a high energy level and execute at a high level in order to beat them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB may be without its star player in sophomore center Alan Williams who sprained his right ankle in the first half of the Pacific game. Williams has missed three games this season due to an injury to his hamstring, an injury that first occurred in that double-overtime victory against Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>“He’s moving around a lot better than he did when he got hurt last weekend,” Boswell said. “I can tell things are getting better, so it’d be great if he’s available for this Saturday, but if not, we’ll be ready regardless and we’ll have a chance to win whatever his status is.”</p>\n<p>With the possibility UCSB will be without its star player, the Gauchos might have to rely on freshman forward Sam Beeler to fill in for Big Al. Beeler has come on strong as of late, playing a career-high 23 minutes against Pacific in which he scored six points and grabbed four boards. Another player UCSB will rely on is junior forward Shawn Moore, a walk-on in his first season as a Gaucho.</p>\n<p>“That’s going to be huge because we’re going to need depth,” Boswell said. “We’ll be ready to go. Cal Poly is a good team and if we don’t all come together and basically contribute individually in order to make our team better, we’re not going to get this win this weekend.”</p>\n<p>Cal Poly is coming off two straight victories over Pacific and UC Davis, and will end a three-game homestand Saturday. Overall, UCSB has won 11 of the last 12 meetings against Cal Poly and owns the all-time series record 69-31.</p>\n<p>The Mustangs are led by junior forward Chris Eversley, who is first on the team in scoring with 15.4 points per game and the only player to average double figures for Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in forward Taran Brown and guard Michael Bryson will also be pivotal in Saturday’s matchup, as each has shown flashes of brilliance this season for the Gauchos. Brown is third on the team averaging 12.1 points and Bryson is fourth at 6.9 points per game. In his last three games, however, Bryson is averaging 12.7 points and six rebounds per contest.</p>\n<p>“Everybody needs to step up,” Coach Williams said. “Injuries are not an excuse, it’s just what happens and it creates opportunities for other guys.”</p>\n<p>Saturday’s Blue-Green rivalry game is scheduled to tip-off at 7 p.m. at Cal Poly’s Mott Athletics Center.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 1 of February 15th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50208\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50208\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-15/ucsb-running-this-rivalry/","id":677,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[676,675,674],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Snap Skid, Overpower Pacific","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With their backs against the wall, the UCSB men’s basketball team came out Saturday night with a clear sense of urgency.

Taylor hit his first two three-pointers and sophomore center Alan Williams added six quick points to give UCSB a 12-0 lead to start the game. That run was put in danger, however, when Williams sprained his right ankle midway through the first half.</p>\n<p>“We stick in there with each other,” Taylor said. “We were going to get that win no matter what tonight. We had to stick together and stay strong and compete, and we did.”</p>\n<p>UCSB responded without its best player, turning a four-point advantage at the point of Big Al’s departure into a 37-29 halftime lead.</p>\n<p>Big Al recorded 10 points and seven rebounds in a mere eight minutes on the night, providing UCSB with solid play in the first half. Williams missed three games due to a hamstring injury and was playing in only his third game back on Saturday before suffering another injury.</p>\n<p>“I thought we started this game with pretty good fight,” Coach Williams said. “I’m disappointed to see [Big Al] go out. I think he was going to have a big game, he looked very active.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing without Big Al, Santa Barbara continued to show its resilient energy in the second half. The Gauchos are down to eight players now without Williams and an assortment of other injured Gauchos.</p>\n<p>A pair of freshmen in forward Taran Brown and guard Michael Bryson led the Gauchos in scoring with 13 points apiece. Brown pulled down a team-high eight rebounds, while Bryson grabbed six boards on the night.</p>\n<p>“We played more as a team tonight,” Brown said. “We got some good vibes going and some positive energy and that’s really what we need right now. We just started off hot right away. It was a good feeling. We just kept pushing the whole night.”</p>\n<p>The story of the night for the Gauchos was their hot shooting, as they shot 50 percent on both field goals and three-pointers. Junior guard Kyle Boswell scored nine points on the night while finishing 3-3 from beyond the arc.</p>\n<p>“We hit some shots, we played with a great sense of urgency, we had some good energy; I thought they pulled for each other pretty hard tonight,” Coach Williams said. “That’s something as a young group, sometimes you just start playing instead of playing with a purpose. I thought we had a little better purpose [tonight].”</p>\n<p>Taylor provided the Gauchos with solid play at the point on the night, registering a career-high tying 11 points along with eight assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>Junior forward Ross Rivera led Pacific with 15 points on the night and was one of only two Tigers to register double-digit scoring along with senior guard Lorenzo McCloud who had 10 points.</p>\n<p>“It’s big, we needed a win. It’s been awhile obviously since we got a win,” Brown said. “We needed to get back on track so it was a good game for us and we’ve just got to keep pushing it and go get Cal Poly now.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face rival Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50134\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50134\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-11/gauchos-snap-skid-overpower-pacific/","id":673,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[672,671,670],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Cold Gauchos Fall to Sharpshooting Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The shots weren’t falling for the UCSB men’s basketball team last night as the Gauchos dropped a 64-56 game to UC Davis that extended Santa Barbara’s season long losing streak to five games.

Overall, UCSB shot 34.9 percent from the field last night.</p>\n<p>“We got good shots up there, they just weren’t falling tonight,” freshman guard Michael Bryson said. “There were times when people were right open and not able to knock it down. We’re going to have bad shooting nights, but we can’t blame the game on just the shooting. [Davis] shot lights out and we can’t let that happen.”</p>\n<p>While Santa Barbara came out cold, Davis was on fire from the start, shooting nearly 49 percent from the field on the night. In the first half, the Aggies were shooting above 50 percent from both the field and behind the three.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Corey Hawkins, the Big West leading scorer, led all players with 20 points on the night while registering a team high nine rebounds. Junior guard Ryan Sypkens added 15 points while sophomore forward J.T. Adenrele scored 10 for Davis.</p>\n<p>“We’re not playing together as a group, as a team right now,” sophomore center Alan Williams said. “It wasn’t close by any stretch of the imagination tonight. They completely dominated us.”</p>\n<p>Big Al, who was playing in only his second game since returning from injury, registered team highs with 15 points and 13 rebounds for his 10th double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>Bryson scored 13 points for UCSB but was 1-8 on three-point shots. He, along with freshman forward Taran Brown, pulled down eight rebounds for a Gauchos squad that fell behind 34-22 at the half.</p>\n<p>“I’m surprised we were so bad offensively that first half,” Coach Williams said. “We got frustrated, rattled by the physicalness of the game, rattled by just how they came at us. I don’t think we ever played offensively very well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will now shift their focus to Saturday night’s game against Pacific, which fell 67-62 against Cal Poly last night. Despite the loss, the Tigers sit in second place in the Big West with a 13-9 overall record and 7-3 mark in conference play.</p>\n<p>“I can’t see this basketball team beating Pacific without hitting threes,” Coach Williams said. “We’re going to have to just keep grinding and shoot the ball better.”</p>\n<p>With 10 teams in the Big West this season, only the top eight will advance to the conference tournament. Now with only seven conference games remaining, UCSB must win immediately if it wants to play well into March.</p>\n<p>“We’ve just got to come together and figure it out and win some games,” Big Al said. “It’s not about X’s and O’s or anything like that, it’s about our heart and our determination and our pride in going out there and representing UCSB basketball in the best way we can, and right now, we’re not doing that.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off for Saturday night’s game is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p>\n<h6><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the February 8th 2013’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50163\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50163\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-08/cold-gauchos-fall-to-sharpshooting-davis/","id":670,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[669,668,667],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Seeks to Break Four-Game Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB men’s basketball team will attempt to break its season high four-game losing streak tonight when they host UC Davis at the Thunderdome.

If UCSB hopes to outpace a dangerous Davis offense this time around, they might need another solid night from Williams.</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard Corey Hawkins leads Davis and the Big West in scoring with 19.4 points per game. Last time out against Santa Barbara, Hawkins scored 23 points on an efficient 7-11 from the field. Earlier this season against Hawaii, Hawkins led the Aggies to a 93-82 victory by registering a career-high and school record 40 points.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to keep him under control,” Coach Williams said. “We can’t let him go off like he did at Hawaii. We have to be aware of where he is and not let him have easy looks.”</p>\n<p>During the four-game losing streak, UCSB had a chance to win every game but came up short in each. The four losses came by a combined total of 15 points, the last two each by a two-point margin.</p>\n<p>“It’s a big weekend for us right now,” Big Al said. “We’ve got to go out there and string some wins together [and] try to get some momentum for the end of the season.”</p>\n<p>When UCSB previously faced Davis, sophomore guard T.J. Taylor was the only other Gaucho to score in double figures aside from Williams with 10 points. Santa Barbara will need to see plenty of scoring from junior guard Kyle Boswell and freshman forward Taran Brown this time around if it wants to beat Davis.</p>\n<p>One of the major emphases for UCSB entering tonight’s game will be slowing down Davis’ outside game, as the Aggies are one of the top shooting teams in the conference. Davis ranks second in the Big West in free throw percentage, field-goal percentage and three-point percentage, highlighting the Aggies as a dangerous and efficient team from anywhere on the floor.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of February 7th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50064\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50064\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-07/ucsb-seeks-to-break-four-game-skid/","id":668,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[667,666,665],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gaucho Comeback Falls Short in Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Santa Barbara fell behind early in the first half against UC Irvine, and despite a furious second-half comeback, the Gauchos dropped a 62-60 decision off a game-winning three-pointer from Irvine.

Down by as much as 20, the Gauchos rallied behind strong play from Big Al who led all players with 22 points, eight rebounds and three steals.</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Taran Brown sank a jumper with 21 seconds remaining to give UCSB a one-point lead, but Irvine forward Michael Wilder responded with a three-pointer with 10 seconds remaining to give the Anteaters the lead once more. Junior guard Kyle Boswell missed a three at the buzzer securing Irvine’s second consecutive victory.</p>\n<p>“I liked that we played well together, we fought and there was a lot more fight in us in the second half,” Coach Williams said. “[Irvine] got 10 offensive rebounds in the first half, they got none in the second half. [We] became a much more cohesive unit in that second half and played much better together.”</p>\n<p>Boswell scored 15 off the bench while freshman guard Michael Bryson added 12 points for the Gauchos. UCSB also played without freshman forward Mitch Brewe who was injured and ruled out for the year.</p>\n<p>While UCSB is disappointed by the loss, it has to feel encouraged by Big Al’s return to the lineup and his impressive performance in his first game back.</p>\n<p>“I thought he had a lot of rust on him, especially in the first half and was maybe a little tentative and got frustrated with himself a little bit in the first half,” Coach Williams said. “But I thought in the second half he was sensational.”</p>\n<p>Close contests have been unkind to the Gauchos recently as their four straight losses have been by a combined 15 points.

Despite injuries and a young squad, the Gauchos have shown toughness in sticking with opponents, but have not been able to get over a hump with a win.</p>\n<p>“The thing I liked the best about what we did at Long Beach was I thought we played really hard and that was a real positive sign,” Coach Williams said. “We were scrappy, tough minded and played hard.”</p>\n<p>Irvine is coming off a 52-45 victory against Cal Poly at home to bring its conference home record to 4-0. The Anteaters also feature six players who average 7.7 points or more per game, and are led by senior guard Daman Starring, who averages a team-best 13.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“They are a very deep team and it’s not a matter of any one guy; it’s a different guy for every game,” Coach Williams said. “Starring is a very good player, good shooter and versatile. [Senior center Adam] Folker I think the world of and [senior forward Michael] Wilder is very tough and competitive.”</p>\n<p>When the two teams previously played on Jan. 3, UCSB pulled out a 74-71 victory at the Thunderdome, but things may be different this time around at Irvine.</p>\n<p>“[Sophomore forward] Will Davis didn’t play against us last time, so that’s a different weapon for them,” Coach Williams said. “There are just a lot of different pieces to their puzzle that make them very difficult to play.”</p>\n<p>Big Al’s status for Saturday’s game is in question after missing the previous three games with a strained left hamstring tendon. Williams leads the team in points, rebounds and blocks, and is among the top three in the conference for each category as well.</p>\n<p>“He has not practiced at all,” Coach Williams said. “He is doing separate workouts, he’s back running, he’s back doing some lateral work and doing some one-on-one stuff. We’ll see; he’s making progress.”</p>\n<p>Junior forward Kyle Boswell has been the Gauchos’ leader since Big Al’s injury and is second on the team in scoring with 13 points per game. Freshman forward Taran Brown is right behind Boswell averaging 12.7 points per game. Brown also ranks second on the team in rebounds and blocks with averages of 5.8 boards and one block per game.</p>\n<p>In order to beat Irvine, the Gauchos will need to both provide a scoring boost and limit the Anteaters’ many weapons.</p>\n<p>“We have to make more shots and we have to find a way to keep people off the foul line,” Coach Williams said. “The number one thing that has been the consistency in all three games [during the losing streak] is that we’ve got our rear ends kicked from the foul line.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Irvine Saturday is scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 4 of February 1st, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49964\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49964\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-02-01/ucsb-looks-to-break-three-game-losing-skid/","id":660,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[659,658,657],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls in Televised Game to Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Injuries have begun to take their toll on the UCSB men’s basketball team as the Gauchos dropped their second consecutive game in a 78-73 loss to Hawaii Saturday at the Thunderdome.

Even more impressive, Standhardinger only had four points at the break, exploding for 27 in the second half.</p>\n<p>“He’s a really good player,” Coach Williams said. “He’s what this league doesn’t have a lot of, a 6’8” wing-type player that’s got a body on him. In this league he can play anywhere from the two to the five. He hurts you in a lot of ways.”</p>\n<p>Clearly overmatched down low due to the absence of Williams, UCSB opted to try its luck from long range, attempting 28 three-pointers, compared to 10 for Hawaii. The Gauchos converted nine of those opportunities, but its top two three-point shooters in freshman forward Taran Brown and junior guard Kyle Boswell were a combined 1-15 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Taran didn’t do much for his percentage tonight,” Coach Williams said. “It’s a bad shooting night out of those two. You have to give people some credit, they’re doing some good things on Bos.”</p>\n<p>Brown led UCSB with 15 points and six rebounds, but shot 7-23 on the night including a dismal 1-12 from behind the arc. Boswell was second on the team with 12 points, but was 0-3 on three-pointers. Sophomore guard T.J. Taylor notched 11 points and four assists on the night, while senior guard Nate Garth had eight points and eight assists.</p>\n<p>Out with injury for much of the season, junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle provided UCSB with solid play with eight points, two assists and two steals in 21 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>“The guy that I actually thought had a pretty decent game again was Keegan Hornbuckle in terms of doing what he is capable of doing and having to play more minutes than he is capable of right now,” Coach Williams said.</p>\n<p>Fouls plagued UCSB for much of the night as Hawaii shot 39 free throws.

Northridge switched to a full court press, however, leading to 13 straight points and a 65-59 lead that Santa Barbara was unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>A pair of sophomore forwards in Stephan Hicks and Stephen Maxwell fueled Northridge to victory. Maxwell led the Matadors with an impressive 27-point, 12-rebound night, while Hicks scored 24 points and recorded four steals. Northridge out-rebounded UCSB 43-31 and committed only 11 turnovers compared to the Gauchos’ 15.</p>\n<p>“I thought [Northridge’s players] were warriors out there, coming back when they went down seven,” Coach Williams said. “When you’re 0-7 and you go down seven in that second half, you could implode a little bit. And they didn’t, they kept fighting and they kept in there.”</p>\n<p>Without its leading scorer and rebounder in Big Al, UCSB relied on the play of freshman forwards Sam Beeler and Mitch Brewe to replace the production down low. While Brewe scored two points and grabbed four boards, Beeler had a breakout game with 13 points, six rebounds and three blocks.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re getting what we can get out of them,” Coach Williams said. “They’re playing hard, they’re raw, they’re going to have positives, they’re going to have negatives; that’s part of growing up. Sam obviously put up some good numbers and shows he has good promise.”</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Taran Brown led UCSB with 18 points on 4-9 shooting from behind the arc, becoming the school leader in single season three-pointers made by a freshman in the process. Junior guard Kyle Boswell had 15 points for the Gauchos and junior forward Keegan Hornbuckle registered a season-high nine points after missing most of the season due to injury.</p>\n<p>“They out-rebounded us a little bit there. It was just a very physical game overall, I would say,” Beeler said. “When we had turnovers, we kind of got out of our groove I think, and that was hard to come back from and obviously that was very frustrating.”</p>\n<p>Now the Gauchos must look to Saturday’s game when they will host new Big West member Hawaii. The Warriors fell 88-59 at Cal Poly last night and enter with a 10-9 record (4-4 Big West).</p>\n<p>“We just know that they’re a big team,” Hornbuckle said. “Our big men are going to have to come out and play hard and keep playing hard like they’re doing.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii started its tenure in the Big West on fire with three straight conference victories but have since dropped three of four.

Davis battled back, bringing the game as close as three points, but Santa Barbara proved clutch in the final moments.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Kyle Boswell converted a rare four-point play to give the Gauchos a 59-51 lead with just over two minutes to play. After five straight points by the Aggies, senior guard Nate Garth responded, draining a three-pointer and advancing UCSB’s lead to 62-56. Santa Barbara was able to close out the game from there, clinching its first conference road victory of the season with a 66-59 win.</p>\n<p>“That shot [Garth] hit was probably the biggest shot of the game in terms of holding them off when they’re making a run at us,” Coach Williams said. “It didn’t ice the game, but it put a lot of pressure on them to get back into it.”</p>\n<p>Big Al fueled UCSB on Saturday, posting an impressive 28 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots.</p>\n<p>“He had two double-doubles on the road trip. It’s a phenomenal effort,” Coach Williams said. “He was very efficient from the floor offensively, kept a lot of balls alive, blocked shots; he pretty much did it all.”</p>\n<p>Davis was nearly propelled to victory by the play of sophomore guard Corey Hawkins who led the team in multiple categories with 23 points and four assists on the night. Hawkins averages 18 points per game, just behind Williams 18.1 per game, and ranks fourth in the conference this season. With the loss, the Aggies fell to 5-10 overall (1-3 Big West).</p>\n<p>Sophomore guard T.J. Taylor provided a spark for Santa Barbara, scoring 10 points and adding a team-high six assists. In Big West play, Taylor leads the conference in assists with 7.4 per game; nearly three more than any other player in conference play this season.</p>\n<p>“T.J. bounced back really well from maybe his worst performance of the year at UOP to playing a very solid, heady, floor-game for us where he made good decisions,” Coach Williams said. “The fact that he bounced back, took care of the ball and only had one turnover was huge for us.”</p>\n<p>Thursday’s performance at Pacific was much less inspiring for the Gauchos as UCSB trailed 38-25 entering the second half. Big Al was impressive with 22 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks, but Santa Barbara was outrebounded by five and committed eight more turnovers than the Tigers.</p>\n<p>Pacific was led by junior forward Tony Gill’s 17 points off the bench as 54 of the Tigers’ 80 points came from non-starters. The Tigers improved to 9-7 overall, and their 3-1 mark in the Big West place them in a tie for second in the conference standings.</p>\n<p>“We went in the Pacific game down 13 at halftime, come out and score the first five and just never mount a comeback after that,” Coach Williams said. “We couldn’t make shots, couldn’t get stops, couldn’t get matched up. Just a bad outing.”</p>\n<p>Boswell shot 4-8 from the field on the way to 15 points for UCSB. Taylor scored six points and added nine assists, but committed six of the Gauchos’ 13 turnovers in the process.</p>\n<p>UCSB returns home to play rival Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 14th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49349\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-splits-weekend-series-cal/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49349\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-splits-weekend-series-cal/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-splits-weekend-series-cal/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-splits-weekend-series-cal/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-splits-weekend-series-cal/","id":683,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[682,681,680],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Men’s Basketball: Long Beach State 49ers","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The defending Big West Champion, Long Beach State men’s basketball team graduated four of its five players from last year’s starting lineup, but the 49ers were once again picked as preseason favor...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The defending Big West Champion, Long Beach State men’s basketball team graduated four of its five players from last year’s starting lineup, but the 49ers were once again picked as preseason favorites to repeat as conference champs.

Three juniors in guard Keala King and forwards Dan Jennings and Tony Freeland have all cracked Long Beach’s starting lineup alongside Caffey and Ennis.</p>\n<p>Of the three transfers, Jennings is the only one who has been eligible the entire season. Jennings is fourth in scoring for the 49ers averaging over 10 points per game. He is also second on the 49ers and 11th in the conference with 6.3 rebounds per contest.</p>\n<p>In only three games this season, Freeland has made an impact for the 49ers averaging 12 points and 6.3 rebounds, marks that would rank second on the team if sustained since the beginning of the season.</p>\n<p>King, meanwhile, has only made one start for Long Beach in its most recent game against UCSB, but has had an important impact averaging 8.3 points and six rebounds.</p>\n<p>A relatively young team, the 49ers only other senior on the roster aside from Ennis is guard Peter Pappageorge. Pappageorge averages 6.9 points per game and has started in 11 of the team’s 14 games this season.</p>\n<p>Despite sporting a lineup that is still new to playing with each other, Long Beach looks to be a dangerous team in the Big West and one that will certainly be in the hunt for the conference title in March.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of January 9th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49723\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/long-beach-state-49ers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49723\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/long-beach-state-49ers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/long-beach-state-49ers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/long-beach-state-49ers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-09/long-beach-state-49ers/","id":710,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[709,708,707],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Downed by Long Beach at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Facing defending Big West Champion Long Beach State, the UCSB men’s basketball team fell 77-70 on Saturday at the Thunderdome after a comeback attempt fell short.

Long Beach improved to 6-8 overall (2-1 Big West) with the victory.</p>\n<p>“We guarded the perimeter pretty well, and then they go to the high post and there was miscommunication,” junior guard Kyle Boswell said. “We’ve got to work on that because that’s unacceptable.”</p>\n<p>Long Beach was led by sophomore guard Michael Caffey, who hit a buzzer beating three-pointer to give the 49ers a 41-31 halftime lead. Caffey led all players with 19 points and nine rebounds while also recording a team-high five assists.</p>\n<p>Boswell helped the Gauchos by adding 14 points and a game-high three steals off the bench while shooting 3-6 on three-pointers. UCSB shot 13-23 from the free throw and 9-21 on threes.</p>\n<p>“We couldn’t get over the hump; we couldn’t get them behind us,” Coach Williams said. “That’s the next step for us, obviously, is to be able to put them behind us once we crawl back into the game and take advantage of that.”</p>\n<p>As the third-youngest team in the nation, UCSB received promising performances from many players, battling two close losses against Fullerton and Long Beach. The Gauchos have been unable to capitalize on some of the strong performances they have received, such as sophomore guard T.J. Taylor’s eight point, nine assist game on Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We’re competing a lot better. When they made a run we kind of responded and that’s what you look for in a tough team,” Boswell said. “It’s a sign that we are getting better. We’re losing some hard games, and it’s tough when you know that we’re good enough to beat theses teams, but we’re going to keep improving and we’re going to get there.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next travels to face University of the Pacific on Thursday. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 7th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49202\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/ucsb-downed-long-beach-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49202\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/ucsb-downed-long-beach-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/ucsb-downed-long-beach-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/ucsb-downed-long-beach-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/ucsb-downed-long-beach-home/","id":708,"author":{"id":72,"name":"Paul-Michael Ochoa"},"related":[707,706,705],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":6,"highestPage":14,"route":"/authors/72"}},"__N_SSG":true}
