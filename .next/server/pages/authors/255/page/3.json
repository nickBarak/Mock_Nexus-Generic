The defensive tone for the match was set by the senior libero Emilia Petrachi as she totaled a game-high 29 digs that proved to be massively important in such a tight match.</p>\n<p>Hawaii was able to match the defensive output of UCSB with the help of Tita Akiu’s 26 digs and McKenna Granato’s 16 kills and 14 digs. Those two senior leaders for Hawai’i made the most noise on the floor for the Rainbow Wahine as their efforts were barely enough to scrape by the pesky Gauchos in five sets.</p>\n<p>The game got off to a rough start for both squads as there were 22 combined errors in the first set, and the teams jostled for the lead throughout the game until UCSB managed to pull away late to take the first victory by a score of 25-19.</p>\n<p>The second set was not as tightly contested as Hawai’i got off to an early lead and held on to win 25-14 and even the series to one game apiece.</p>\n<p>The third set was controlled early by the Gauchos as they held as much as a six point lead and were looking to pull away from Hawaii. But then a trio of service and attack errors by UCSB let visiting Hawai’i get right back into the game. The third set was tightly contested as each team alternated leads until the Rainbow Wahine scored the final five points of the set to give themselves a 2-1 lead in the series.</p>\n<p>After a devastating loss in the third set the Gauchos could have laid down and accepted defeat from a superior team, but they instead bounced back in the fourth set and handily defeated Hawaii 25-19. This win ensured a decisive fifth set to 15 points to determine who would leave victorious.</p>\n<p>The experienced Rainbow Wahine proved too much in the deciding set, however, as they jumped out to an early 8-2 lead and never looked back, finishing off the Gauchos 15-10 in the fifth set.</p>\n<p>Every loss hurts but many positives can be taken from this match moving forward and coach Lantagne Welch’s squad definitely proved that they can compete with the top dogs in the Big West.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-84243\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-06/ucsb-loses-war-of-attrition-to-rainbow-wahine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-84243\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-06/ucsb-loses-war-of-attrition-to-rainbow-wahine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-06/ucsb-loses-war-of-attrition-to-rainbow-wahine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-06/ucsb-loses-war-of-attrition-to-rainbow-wahine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-06/ucsb-loses-war-of-attrition-to-rainbow-wahine/","id":5571,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[5570,5569,5568],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Get Back on Track with win over CSUN, prepare for Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Volleyball","publish_date":"2018-10-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-04-print-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WVball_vsCalPoly-171014-DustinHarris-04-print-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB women's volleyball team is currently 4-1 in Big West play as it gets set to host Hawai'i this weekend.

The two squads then alternated leads for the rest of the set, until a late run by the Gauchos set up a 25-20 first-set victory.</p>\n<p>In the second set, Santa Barbara started out hot, growing its lead by as much as eight points at several different junctures in the match.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos held a comfortable 19-11 lead after a kill by Charlie Robinson, and it seemed as if they were about to pull away until a plethora of serve errors and attack errors by UCSB sparked a 9-0 run by the Matadors, which allowed them to retake the lead 20-19.</p>\n<p>From that point on, the two teams alternated points until two clutch aces by Lindsey Ruddins put the set away with a score of 27-25.</p>\n<p>The third set did not contain nearly as much drama as the second. In this set, the Gauchos jumped out to an early lead and refused to relinquish their power, extending the lead to double digits early on and finishing off Northridge with a score of 25-12.</p>\n<p>This win improved the UCSB women’s record to 12-6 overall, improving their conference record to a solid 4-2, an instrumental win in climbing the ranks to third place in the Big West.</p>\n<p>One of the teams that the Gauchos trail behind in the Big West standings is their next opponent, the 8-5 Hawaii Rainbow Warriors, who currently sport an excellent 4-0 conference record. This match carries significant importance for the Gauchos because, if they are able to pull off the win at home this Friday versus Hawaii, it will show the rest of the Big West players that they belong at the top of the conference among the other elite teams.</p>\n<p>If UCSB wants a chance to beat Hawaii, it is going to have to slow down talented libero “Tita” Akiu — who leads her team with 4.79 digs/set — as well as the scoring trio McKenna Granato, Norene Iosia and Casey Castillo, all of whom average over 2.3 kills/set.</p>\n<p>Aside from the usual contributors (Ruddins and Petrachi), other players (like middle blocker Charlie Robinson and setter Olivia Lovenberg) have caught fire at a great time in the season and have contributed greatly to UCSB’s success so far. These outside contributors must continue their stellar play as the Gauchos embark on a difficult stretch of games in the thick of conference play.</p>\n<p>UCSB is 6-38 all-time against the Rainbow Wahine, with a current streak of nine straight losses to Hawaii. This next home match would be a perfect time to break that losing streak and show the rest of the Big West that the Gauchos are the real deal.</p>\n<p>The match versus Hawaii will take place at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 5, in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara women’s volleyball team took a trip out east to the University of Denver where they played a set of three games in two days against stout competition in the Denver Classic. Coming into the weekend the UCSB women’s squad sported a 2-1 record and had won their last two matches coming into Friday’s game. The Gauchos ended</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">up dropping their first two games of the weekend against Denver and Sacramento State before ultimately prevailing in their final match versus McNeese State.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> UCSB dropped its opener to the Denver Pioneers in a thriller of a back-and-forth game that came down to the fifth set to determine a winner. The Gauchos were lead by Redshirt Junior Lindsey Ruddins who put up a monster statistical night with 27 kills, 12 digs, and a .386 kill percentage. She also found some support in teammates Olivia Lovenberg and Emilia Petrachi, who tallied 55 assists and 20 digs, respectively. This was a competitive match that saw each team alternate winning sets and Denver barely eked it out at the end, winning the fifth and final set 25-23.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s slate of games for the Gauchos featured matches against McNeese State and Sacramento State, in a difficult doubleheader following Friday night’s grueling five-set match. The day began with an exciting match against the Sacramento State Hornets, and even though the Gauchos suffered a three sets to none loss, each set was decided by two points as the two squads battled back and forth for the entire game. Lindsey Ruddins again lead the way with 15 kills and 14 digs, Olivia Lovenberg added 40 assists, and Charlie Robinson also added 11 kills to help the Gauchos keep it competitive. The three sets played in this match all featured come-from-behind efforts by both teams, however Sac State managed to pull out the win in all three sets in order to complete the sweep.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second match of the Saturday doubleheader featured the Gauchos going up against the McNeese State Cowgirls. After dropping the previous two matches in the Denver Classic, the Gauchos came out against McNeese State and earned a decisive win hinging on a great team defensive performance. UCSB won the first two sets by scores of 25-19 and 25-14, dropped the third set narrowly by a 25-22 margin, but recovered to clinch the win in the fourth set with a score of 25-17. Ruddins again lead the way for the Gauchos with 18 kills and 9 digs, but big games from several other Gauchos were what provided the spark in this one. Three other Gauchos in addition to Ruddins accrued double digit kills in this one, including Megan Lewis with 10, Nicole Omwanghe with 11, and Torre Glasker with 12. Freshman Olivia Lovenberg also had another great outing as she came up one assist shy of her season high with 54 assists. A win such as this one is important to get some confidence back for the team after two tough losses and it could prove to push the team in the right direction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next time the Gauchos will take the floor will be back in the friendly confines of the Thunderdome against Texas Tech on Friday, September 7th at 6pm.

UCSB’s five leaders in kills from last season were all underclassmen, and thus they are all returning as veterans in 2018.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of these five is star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, who led the NCAA with 5.84 kills per set in 2017 and plans on returning to form again this year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Also returning are the Gauchos’ leaders in assists from last year, senior setters Annie Hasselmann and Lexi Rottman, who will benefit from another year of growth with a similar team. For a team that struggled at times last season to put everything together and compete, the return of most of the main contributors is important to having a comeback season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While many key players will be returning to the floor again in 2018, Head Coach Lantagne Welch has also added more depth to the Gaucho roster by way of six freshman recruits and one transfer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">These Gaucho newcomers will certainly benefit from playing alongside the experience of the eight upperclassmen on the team, but they will also be asked to contribute a significant amount in their first year due to the upside and talent of these accomplished freshmen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">One of the Gauchos’ weaknesses in years past has been their overall depth, and opposing teams were able to exploit that over the course of a match. However, with so many experienced veterans and new pieces, the previous lack of depth should no longer be a weakness, but rather a strength that will benefit Lantagne Welch’s squad this season.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Last season was difficult for the Gauchos, as they got off to a rough start and were only able to win one non-conference game in the early stages of the season. They managed to pick things up during conference play and put together a solid 7-9 record against Big West opponents.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The team will certainly expect more consistent play throughout the season with a more experienced and talented team this time around.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There is a lot of optimism going into this season with many interesting new pieces and returning stars; however, this does mean that expectations will be higher for the Gauchos and Coach Lantagne Welch.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB women’s volleyball has not had a winning record in the Big West since the 2013 season, during which they went 13-3, won a share of the conference title and secured an NCAA tournament berth.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While the expectations might not be that high for this year, improvement is expected, and the team knows this, so they will definitely come out of the gate motivated to show that this year is different.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Gauchos begin their season on Friday, Aug. 24, with a match against the Cincinnati Bearcats, during which they hope to get their season started off on the right note.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83890\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83890\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/","id":5559,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[5558,5557,5556],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"NBA Draft Superlatives","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nba-rooks-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nba-rooks-2.jpg?resize=980%2C570&ssl=1","description":"The NBA's newest class of rookies is examined by staff writer Jake Ciccone, as he makes his early predictions for some of the most rewarding picks of this year's draft.

Soon enough next season will be here, and a new class of rookies will be eager to take the league by storm. This draft class has been labeled as loaded from the lottery to the second round and it will be fascinating to see if it lives up to the hype. Here are my thoughts on some of the draft’s important selections and storylines.</p>\n<p><strong>Rookie of the Year:</strong> Marvin Bagley</p>\n<p>Even with the number two pick in the draft this year, the Kings will still probably find themselves near the bottom of the western conference standings again while they continue to develop their young talent. With that being said, Marvin Bagley will surely be looked to as the Kings go-to scorer and he’ll have many opportunities to put up big numbers. The Kings will be facing no pressure to win games this season which will allow Bagley to play freely and take his lumps while adjusting to the NBA game. With a brand new focal point of their offense, the Kings will hopefully begin to develop some sort of identity moving forward with their collection of promising young players. If Bagley took home Rookie of the Year honors that would be a step in the right direction for their franchise.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Luka Doncic</p>\n<p>Doncic’s stats will most likely be less impressive than Bagley’s, but if he and the Mavs are able to improve enough to squeak into the playoffs, his efforts just might be rewarded handsomely.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Value Pick: </strong>Robert Williams</p>\n<p>Robert Williams, out of Texas A&amp;M, was projected by some to go as high as the late lottery due to his size and athleticism but concerns about his work ethic and off-court problems caused him to fall into the late first round on draft night. So, when the Celtics swiped him up at 27 it was considered a steal and a low-risk pick for that late in the round. Williams is potentially a great fit for Boston, a team that has proven to be great defensively and could easily insert him into a backup center role behind Al Horford. They have enough offensive tools that he will only have to worry about playing defense, running the floor, and catching lobs, all of which he currently excels at. Coach Brad Stevens has been noted for his ability to work with headcases and turn them into productive players, and he will more than likely turn the physical tools of Williams into production for Boston.</p>\n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Michael Porter Jr.</p>\n<p>His injuries are a massive question mark, but if Porter can live up to his potential, he could prove to be the piece that launches Denver from fringe-playoff team to contender.</p>\n<p><strong>Riskiest Pick: </strong>Trae Young</p>\n<p>Trae Young undoubtedly put up a historic season last year at Oklahoma, leading the county in both points and assists as a freshman. This being said, he did struggle in the latter half of the season when teams game-planned for him and took him out of his rhythm. Young is small in stature and it is possible that he struggles initially with the physicality of the NBA. Also, the fact that the Hawks had Luka Doncic and swapped him for Young on draft night puts some added pressure on him. Hawks fans better hope that Young lives up to expectations because if Doncic shines and Young disappoints, that draft night trade will haunt their franchise forever.</p>\n<p><em>Runner up:</em> Mo Bamba</p>\n<p>Orlando currently lacks any promising playmakers on offense so adding another defensive big with players like Collin Sexton and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander left on the board could prove costly going into the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Second Round Pick: </strong>Keita Bates Diop</p>\n<p>Bates-Diop was projected to go as high as mid-first round in many mock drafts, so it was very surprising when Minnesota was able to scoop him up with the 48th pick. KBD has all of the tools to be an effective NBA player such as defensive length, shooting ability, and experience from four years of college ball. This is an extremely low-risk pick for the T Wolves this late in the draft because he has the ability to come in and contribute right away for a team looking to return to the playoffs. Bates-Diop could also serve as a possible Andrew Wiggins replacement if the Wolves go in and seek out a deal to unload the massive contract of Wiggins, who many say does not have a good relationship with the Minnesota front office.</p>\n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Jevon Carter</p>\n<p>The Grizzlies roster last year was a nightly who’s-who of former G-League and overseas players, so Carter is likely to get a decent number of minutes backing up Mike Conley.  Plus, I could not think of a better player to fit in with Memphis’s “Grit and Grind” style of play than the defensive-minded Carter.</p>\n<p><strong>Best under the radar pick: </strong>Omari Spellman</p>\n<p>Omari Spellman is probably not a well-known name to casual basketball fans because he was overshadowed by his great teammates at Villanova last year. Recognition aside, Spellman is built out of a Draymond Green-type mold and could find success early on in his career because of this. He is a proven rebounder and defender with the skill to knock down the three-ball at an efficient clip (43% in college). He does the little things on both ends by hustling and making the high-IQ plays to put his team in the best position to win. There is a place on every roster for a guy who can shoot and defend, and Spellman is in a great position to contribute for Atlanta.</p>\n<p><em>Runner Up:</em> Lonnie Walker</p>\n<p>Walker is a versatile guard who shows promise as a scorer and defender and should pair well with future backcourt mate Dejounte Murray in San Antonio.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83625\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83625\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/","id":996,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[995,994,993],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Warriors Vs.

\r\n</script> \n<p><strong>ANDRE IGUODALA: </strong></p>\n<p>Conversations about the Warriors are always dominated by talk of their four All-Stars, but their fifth man and final piece to their death lineup has been invaluable to their success as a team this year and in years past. Iguodala provides defensive versatility to the Warriors starting five, which allows them to throw different looks at LeBron James throughout the series, which could give him problems. However, Iguodala’s veteran leadership might be the most important thing he adds to Golden State.</p>\n<p>He acts like a second coach on the floor by instructing players on where to go and calming everyone down when they start getting too loose with the ball. The versatility he provides is also apparent on offense, where he can play a point-forward role with the second unit or the starters, allowing the numerous great shooters on their squad to run off screens and find their shot. Iguodala has been ruled out for Game 1 and he will be reevaluated before Game 2, so the Warriors will have to make it work with Kevon Looney or Jordan Bell in his place for now. But if he is able to get back on the floor, even if he isn’t fully healthy, his effect on his team cannot be understated.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>KEVIN LOVE: </strong></p>\n<p>It’s weird to say that an All-Star can be considered an X-Factor to his team, but Kevin Love has been up-and-down throughout the playoffs and he was injured for basically each of the last two games the Cavs played against Boston. Love is still in concussion protocol and his status for Game 1 is uncertain, but if he can get back on the floor and contribute, that opens up a lot of opportunities for his team.</p>\n<p>His best performances in the playoffs came against the Raptors, where he averaged 20.5 points for the series and was clearly playing his most confident basketball. More importantly, when Love was an offensive threat that commanded attention, the other role players on Cleveland were able to find their groove and start producing. If Love can channel his play from the Raptors series and stay healthy, he will take some of the load off of LeBron, and the Cavs might just be able to catch the Warriors off guard and give them a challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Sizing Up Each Squad’s Starting Line-Up</em></p>\n<p>Andrew Bishop</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors feature impressive depth amongst their bench players, this upcoming NBA Finals matchup will be centered around both teams’ formidable starting lineups. Of the 10 players who will be on the court when the Finals kicks off this Wednesday, six made appearances in this year’s all-star game, with the Cavaliers’ LeBron James and the Warriors’ Stephen Curry serving as captains of the East and West all-star teams respectively. While this will be the fourth consecutive finals meeting for the Warriors and the Cavs, the position matchups have changed significantly since last season. Let’s break down each of the starting lineups and who they will be facing this year.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>POINT GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Filling out the point guard position for the Cavs will be seasoned veteran George Hill, who is renowned for his three-point shooting abilities. Hill’s shot has fallen off slightly since the start of the postseason, and he will likely have a tough time competing with the Warriors’ Stephen Curry, one of the league’s most heralded point guards and three-point shooters. Curry’s ability to quickly come off screens and drain deep shots will likely put Hill in a tough spot throughout the series, and his PPG average throughout the postseason (24.8) dwarfs Hill’s (9.7).</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>SHOOTING GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The two guard position will likely favor the Warriors as well, with all-star Klay Thompson facing the Cavs’ veteran J.R. Smith. Like Hill, Smith makes his living behind the arc, leaving more room for LeBron James to do his thing. Smith has shot 36.8 percent on three point attempts this season, and he is known to catch fire when it counts, hitting multiple shots that helped the Cavs capture a Finals victory in 2016. However, Smith will be forced to contend with Klay Thompson, who has been hot this postseason, notching 20.5 PPG and shooting 42.6 percent from three. Thompson is one of the purest shooters in the league, and the Warriors’ offensive system will likely get him multiple open looks, regardless of how hard J.R. plays up on him. While Thompson has a tendency to fall off in big games, if he’s left open, he’s practically automatic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>SMALL FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The small forward matchup will be the one to watch throughout the series. The Warriors will ante up with their star player, Kevin Durant, who has dominated the playoffs with his precise shooting, notching 29.0 [[ok]] PPG. Durant has proved to be a challenge to opponents on both sides of the ball, but he is slightly outmatched by his counterpart on the Cavaliers. LeBron James is arguably the best player of all time, and while Kevin Durant can sometimes hang with him, there is no way to completely shut him down. LeBron almost single-handedly carried the Cavs throughout the postseason, averaging an astonishing 34.0 PPG, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.8 assists. LeBron does it all, and if teams attempt to double him, he has other shooters on the perimeter to back him up. He is a force to be reckoned with, and he certainly has the upper hand in this matchup.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>POWER FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both teams feature small forwards at the four position, with the Warriors starting Kevon Looney, and the Cavs starting Jeff Green in place of the injured Kevin Love. Looney has not done a whole lot during the playoffs, with about 4.5 PPG and 4.9 rebounds, and is mostly just filling in due to injuries. He will likely be outmatched by Green, whose point production helped LeBron get an edge over the Boston Celtics in the last two games of the Eastern Conference Finals. Green has averaged only about 8.3 PPG this postseason, but if he can turn it up during the Finals, he could prove to be even more of an asset to Cleveland.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CENTER: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Golden State and Cleveland fill their five spots with power forwards, operating under more of a “small ball” system. Cleveland’s Tristan Thompson has not lived up to his extensive salary, especially during the playoffs, with a quiet 6.1 PPG and 6.1 rebounds. He will face off against the Warriors’ all-star, Draymond Green, who has been nothing short of studly when it comes to crashing boards, notching 11.6 rebounds per game. Green averages about 11.1 PPG, and while his three point shot has fallen off since the Warriors’ last finals appearance, he is still deadly from just about anywhere on the court.</p>\n<p><em>A version of these stories appeared on p. 7 of the May 31</em><em>, 2018, edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83429\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83429\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/","id":979,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[978,977,976],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Breaking Down the Fan-Favorite Players of the NBA Playoffs","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2018-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/scary-terry-e1526522650167.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/scary-terry-e1526522650167.jpg?resize=534%2C401&ssl=1","description":"With the playoffs in full swing, staff writer Jake Ciccone breaks down some of the most entertaining and at times kooky players in the NBA postseason.

Every playoff team has a star that knows how to get it done, but it often takes the elevated play of an unsuspecting player or two in order to push them to the next level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These players often attain nationwide admiration for clutch play, team leadership, and even relevance in popular meme culture. These qualities mix with the high-intensity of playoff basketball to create a lovable underdog in the eyes of fans.

When that guy looks like everyone’s “cool” high school english teacher and he gets buckets in the playoffs, he reaches another level of admiration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe “Jumping Joe” Ingles has solidified his role as a key player for the Utah Jazz as they surged to end the regular season and kept their momentum moving into the playoffs, where they took down the Thunder in the first round. Ingles lit up OKC for 20+ points two separate times in the six-game series, but it is easy to argue that his most important contribution was getting in Paul George’s head and significantly affecting his play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all culminated in an atrocious 2-16 shooting performance by George in game 6, proving once and for all that Australian trash-talk is one of the most detrimental forms of trash-talk that exists today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ingles cooled off slightly as the Jazz fell to the top-seeded Rockets in round two, but he did drop a signature 27-point performance in Utah’s lone win in that series. Joe Ingles has clearly found himself a place on an up-and-coming Utah team that should be a major threat in the upcoming years. </span></p>\n<p><b>Rajon Rondo</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"779091223\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83057\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83060\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/activate-playoff-rondo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?fit=756%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"756,414\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"activate-playoff-rondo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?fit=250%2C137&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?fit=756%2C414&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83060\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?resize=888%2C486\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"486\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?w=756&amp;ssl=1 756w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/activate-playoff-rondo.jpg?resize=250%2C137&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resurgence of “Playoff Rondo” became a major storyline in the playoffs that coincided with the surprise run to the second round by the New Orleans Pelicans. Rondo looked like a lifeless corpse on the basketball court in his seasons without playoff basketball since he left the Celtics in 2014, and we have all been waiting to see what he was capable of with a solid team around him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The opportunity finally presented itself alongside All-Stars Demarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis in New Orleans, where he finally seemed focused on both ends of the floor and put up some impressive numbers in the team’s two playoff series (10.3 points, 7.6 rebounds, 12.2 assists). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rondo had several monster statistical games including a 10 rebound, 21 assist game in a home win over the Warriors, but maybe the most impressive part of “Playoff Rondo” has been the leadership that he showed as one of the few veterans with championship experience on the roster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was often seen calling out plays and defensive adjustments from the bench as well as standing up for his teammates and not backing down to players like Draymond Green. Rajon Rondo is one of the most unique players in the NBA today and it is clear that he still has some good basketball left in the tank, so hopefully we will see more stellar play from him in the future.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>Terry Rozier</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1233720072\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"83057\"><img data-attachment-id=\"83061\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/terry-rozier/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?fit=2048%2C1185&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1185\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Terry Rozier\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?fit=888%2C514&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83061\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117-1024x593.jpg?resize=888%2C514\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?resize=1024%2C593&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/celtics_terry_rozier_012117.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Scary Terry” sounds like the title of a low-budget 80’s horror movie rather than an NBA player’s nickname.

He followed that up by going up another level to slow down the red-hot Sixers and beat them in 5 games. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scary Terry is averaging an astounding 18.2 points, 5.8 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game throughout the first two rounds, a substantial increase from his regular season averages of 11.3, 2.9, and 4.7.  Part of Rozier’s likeability comes from his exciting, fast-paced style of play, lights-out shooting (39.6% from three on 8 attempts per game), and his numerous highlight-reel finishes over helpless defenders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His attempts to embrace the outpour of admiration have only increased the magnitude of his legend among fans and if he ends up leading the Celtics to a possible NBA finals birth, “Scary Terry” might be a name that is forever inscribed into Celtics lore.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83057\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83057\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/","id":970,"author":{"id":255,"name":"Jake Ciccone"},"related":[969,968,967],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":3,"route":"/authors/255"}},"__N_SSG":true}
