Daily Nexus File Photo.</p></div>\n<p>He has advised the Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, NASA and the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>This past year, he finished his term as an elected chairman of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, which includes 45 of the top research universities across four continents surrounding and within the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>Since 2007, he has been the chairman of the Thirty Meter Telescope project, a partnership between the University of California, Caltech and institutions across the globe working to build a telescope 30 meters in diameter in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. He has also guided nine UCSB Ph.D. candidates with research grants from the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>Since 2008, he has served on the President’s Committee for the National Medal of Science, a U.S. presidential appointment that recommends winners from a pool of nominees to the President of the United States. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Society for Engineering Education and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.</p>\n<p>And for the last 20 years, he has served as chancellor of UCSB.</p>\n<p>Henry T. Yang was invited to become UCSB’s fifth chancellor in 1994 after leaving his position as dean of the Schools of Engineering at Purdue University.</p>\n<p>“I was honored and pleased to be invited to UC Santa Barbara as … chancellor,” Yang said in an email. “To build a pre-eminent world-class research university with excellence and diversity and with the fulfillment of its responsibilities of teaching, research, and service is a mission that will never end.”</p>\n<p>Yang received his bachelor’s degree from National Taiwan University and his Ph.D. from Cornell. According to the Office of the Chancellor, he specializes in aerospace structures, structural dynamics, composite materials, finite elements, transonic aeroelasticity, wind and earthquake structural engineering and intelligent manufacturing systems.</p>\n<p>Yang said he took the job with aspirations of continuing and strengthening the university’s tradition of academic excellence and called the job “exciting and rewarding.”</p>\n<p>According to Yang, the number of freshman applications has quadrupled from 17,000 in 1994 to 66,800 this year, while the GPA of the entering class has risen from 3.47 to 3.98 in that same period. Earlier this month, U.S. News and World Report ranked UCSB as one of the nation’s top ten public universities.</p>\n<p>Former Associated Students President Jonathan Abboud said Yang has played a vital role in intensifying the university’s prestige.</p>\n<p>“Because of him we went from being a backwater UC in 1994 to being one of the top research universities in the world,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, one of the reasons he has remained with UCSB include the university’s election to the Association of American Universities, with five UCSB faculty members and one alumnus winning Nobel Prizes. With characteristic humility, he credits everyone who attends, works at or otherwise contributes to UCSB as grounds for its success.</p>\n<p>“With the vision and hard work of our faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, and supporters, I have had the tremendous honor and joy of witnessing the exciting growth of UC Santa Barbara,” Yang said in an email.</p>\n<p>Abboud, who worked closely with Yang during his time as A.S. president, said although he and the chancellor did not “agree 100 percent on everything,” both shared a mutual respect, especially after dealing with the tumultuous events of last Spring.</p>\n<p>“Well I don’t have experience with any other chancellor, but I do know that he has students at the top of his list of priorities,” Abboud said. “If people had a sit-in in his office, instead of run away like other administrators at other campuses do, he would talk to students and try to solve the issue.”</p>\n<p>Aside from his administrative responsibilities, Yang also teaches a structural engineering once a year to 50 undergraduates in the College of Engineering. Though Yang holds many accolades under his belt, he said his distinguished teaching award from the UCSB Academic Senate is the award he holds most dear.</p>\n<p>“I see him involved a lot,” third-year biology and communication double major Caitlin Weis said. “It seems like he’s more involved with the community than most chancellors.”</p>\n<p>Chair of the Mechanical Engineering Department Francesco Bullo said Yang “has a ton of experience, infinite wisdom and positive energy” and for this reason is happy to have him in the department.<br>\n“I believe our students love working with him and learning from him,” Bullo said in an email. “He’s always ready with a word of advice and encouragement, and he’s so organized and knowledgeable.”<br>\nIndeed, Yang said he is happy to be chancellor.</p>\n<p>“I am so honored and pleased to serve UC Santa Barbara, and to witness it growing steadily and exponentially in excellence, diversity, and world-class stature,” he said. “I look forward to many years of working with our faculty, students, staff, and alumni, and to continuing our exciting journey together.”</p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 4 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <i>Daily Nexus.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56226\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56226\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-25/twenty-years-of-yang/","id":3475,"author":{"id":191,"name":"Hannah Nelson"},"related":[3474,3473,3472],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Curiouser and Curiouser: Last Lecturer Shares His Story","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Last night, linguistics professor Robert Kennedy lectured as if it were his last chance to do so, speaking on linguistics and his own personal experiences in the field, as part of the UCSB “Last Lec...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Prof. Robert Kennedy Gives UCSB’s Third ‘Last Lecture,’ Imparts Wisdom on Life, Love and Finding a Career</h3>\n<p>Last night, linguistics professor Robert Kennedy lectured as if it were his last chance to do so, speaking on linguistics and his own personal experiences in the field, as part of the UCSB “Last Lecture” series.</p>\n<p>As the third installment of the UCSB “Last Lecture” series — which is sponsored by Associated Students and the Academic Affairs Board — Kennedy’s lecture gave insight into everything from his boyhood love of scrutinizing maps to his high school fascination with Latin. His talk drew focus to the idea of curiosity and how his own love of facts and trivia led him to where he is today. The event is part of the “Last Lecture” series, which is inspired by the lecture Carnegie Mellon computer science professor Randy Pausch gave in 2007 before passing away from pancreatic cancer. Kennedy, like all other UCSB last lecturers, was nominated and chosen to speak by UCSB’s undergraduate population, and he was required to present a lecture as if it is the last one in his lifetime.</p>\n<p>According to Kennedy, his curiosity has made him happy and now he seeks to share that curiosity with the students he engages. In discussing his love of linguistics, Kennedy said he chose it as a major, instead of Latin, because he felt there was more to learn and explore. By talking about his own personal and professional endeavors, Kennedy said he is hoping to inspire students to fulfill their own passion and goals as well as possibly take another look into the field of linguistics.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping to … encourage the audience to be okay immersing themselves in the details of what they love to learn about, to be open to a different perspective on language usage,” Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>To do so, Kennedy delved into a number of personal anecdotes, including the story of his time on the popular television trivia game show, “Jeopardy!” Getting on the show was a struggle enough, Kennedy said, requiring three auditions and a skipped visit to his in-laws before he was finally selected to be one of the contestants. However, once on “Jeopardy!” Kennedy won two shows in a row and, at one point mid-competition, made a notable comeback by rising from $600 to $4,400 in one go.</p>\n<p>Edrick Sarkissian, a UCSB alum who graduated last year with a degree in linguistics, said he previously took a few of Kennedy’s classes and thought of the professor as skilled in delivering relatable and engaging lectures. In this light, Sarkissian said the last lecture was a special treat, as he got to know more about the professor’s experiences through his own words.</p>\n<p>“It was neat because he’s someone I’ve always looked up to as a professor, and it was cool to get this insider view of his life,” Sarkissian said. “I know he talked a lot about ‘Jeopardy!’ but that is something that comes up in class a lot, so it was really neat to actually get the whole ‘Jeopardy!’ story first-hand from Kennedy, rather than from teaching assistants.”</p>\n<p>Of course, Kennedy took a few moments to teach the audience a bit about linguistics, diving into what he called the “fake rules” of grammar, such as not ending a sentence with a preposition and referring to one person as “they” or using “literally” to mean “figuratively.” Kennedy also brought up how certain people have a tendency to make judgments about those who make the aforementioned grammatical errors.</p>\n<p>As for other topics discussed within the lecture, Kennedy talked about how language can sometimes be used to justify injustice, how misogyny is often masked as linguistic critique of women’s high pitch and why there is a tendency for people to say the filler word “like” so often. He also touched on the negative stereotypes mapped onto people who speak “African American English” and differences between English and languages rarely spoken today, such as Chumash — which uses a base-four counting system —and Guugu Yimithirr, which incorporates cardinal directions into everyday speech.</p>\n<p>Sarah Luchetta, a first-year English and linguistics double major who took Linguistics 20 with Kennedy last quarter, said she thinks Kennedy is “a really cool dude” who sent a “really good message” about following one’s dreams, especially in light of the current job market for college graduates.</p>\n<p>“I feel like a lot of people are so worried they have to be a part of a STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] major or econ, or something they will for sure get a job in,” Luchetta said. “Your chances are a lot better off if you’re doing something that you really care about, because then you’ll work that much harder to get a job in that field.”</p>\n<p>Olivia Nemec, a first-year undeclared major, said the lecture felt very relevant to her as a student who has yet to pick out a focused field of study.</p>\n<p>“It was really funny; it was really engaging,” Nemec said. “I really think it was inspiring because it was for people who don’t know what they want to do, kind of like me … it felt really motivational.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54246\" style=\"width: 620px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54246\" data-attachment-id=\"54246\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/curiouser-and-curiouser-last-lecturer-shares-his-story/mylastlecture_vandenbelt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MyLastLecture_Vandenbelt.jpeg?fit=1498%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1498,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Peter Vandenbelt VBDphotos.com\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1393445111\",\"copyright\":\"Peter R.

Unlike many other students, however, he designed his own general chemistry experiments last year and is currently taking honors organic chemistry. Then he goes to his part-time job, making cutting-edge breakthroughs in biology professor David Low’s lab. Finally, he arrives home late at night after a long, exhausting day. To some, such a schedule sounds miserable. To Tobolowsky, it sounds like fun.</p>\n<p>“It’s essentially a 15-hour day of straight-up work, and I love it,” he said.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Tobolowsky is a pre-medical student who, along with thousands of other students across the country, has a passion for the health sciences.</p>\n<p>Every year, medical schools receive massive numbers of applications. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, last year almost 8,000 people applied to the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine, 7,000 applied to UC San Francisco, 6,000 to UC San Diego and a little over 5,000 to UC Irvine and UC Davis. Nearly 5,000 applied to Yale while over 6,000 students applied to Harvard and Stanford Universities.</p>\n<p>Now, medical schools are accepting a rising number of students, as the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine reports enrollment at osteopathic medical schools has steadily increased in recent years. The 2011-2012 academic year saw about 5,600 new students enrolled in osteopathic medical schools, reflecting a seven percent rise in first-year enrollment from the previous year.</p>\n<p>Numbers are on the rise, but UCSB Pre-Health Advisor Scott Kassner warns there are several considerations that should go into a student’s decision to enter medical field. For one, he said students should take a hard look at how well they do in hard science courses, sometimes known as “weeder” classes.</p>\n<p>“The first thing is you have to be honest about your academic abilities and your academic interests,” Kassner said. “There are lots of students who are interested in health as a profession because they want to help people, but that doesn’t always mean they’re going to be successful in chemistry or biology — the courses you really have to succeed in to have any chance in medical school.”</p>\n<p>Tobolowsky, too, underlined the necessity of understanding one’s own strengths, even if that means not doing a certain area of medicine or avoiding the field altogether.</p>\n<p>“A physician once told me, ‘You don’t necessarily have to do what you love. Do what you’re good at,’” Tobolowsky said. “If you suck at performing surgery, people are dying left and right. You have to be good at what you’re doing.”</p>\n<p>But students can end up setting standards that are nearly impossible to meet, with the pursuit of high grades putting a great deal of pressure on pre-med students. Kassner, for example, said although stress is often inevitable, he has seen students fret excessively over a single grade: “You have a student who is getting a B in Writing 2 and thinks that they have to drop the class because that B will keep them out of medical school,” Kassner said. “While you do have to be concerned how well you’re doing academically … it’s also not the case that one course keeps you out of medical school.” With such a high standard to reach, students may even be prone to disregarding their own well-being. In this case, Kassner advises students to ask themselves — is medical school really the right path? “Miserable people don’t become doctors,” Kassner said. “Very rarely will they be able to succeed in the application process.”</p>\n<p>But even if a student has been accepted to the school of his or her dreams, actually getting through those four years of intense schooling may prove an even greater obstacle. Consequently, another factor students should consider before going pre-med is how serious of a commitment medical school actually is. “Students have to do research and talk to as many doctors and people in the health professions as they can because it is a very demanding life,” Kassner said.</p>\n<p>Tobolowsky said he is well aware of the reality of being a medical student. “Including undergrad, you potentially sacrifice anywhere from eight to 16 years of your life,” he said. “But those years of your life are dedicated to medicine and helping people in the future, not to your family, to vacations, to some things other people get to enjoy.”</p>\n<p>Another sacrifice associated with medical school is the exorbitant amount of debt medical students are forced into. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, 87 percent of students from public institutions and 84 percent of students from private institutions graduated with debt. These debts were not minimal by any means, as students who graduated from a public medical school ended up with a mean debt of $162,736 while those who graduate from a private institution received a mean debt of $181,058. Kenna Nhey, second-year biochemistry major, said she wants to become a doctor for its “well-respected” nature but hesitates to apply simply because of how expensive medical school tuition is. “The cost of medical school alone is kind of a lot, and it’s four more years plus residency, and I know the healthcare system is changing a lot and doctors might make less.”</p>\n<p>With the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the healthcare system may soon come to rely less upon doctors and more upon individuals in related professions that require less schooling. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will expand coverage to 32 million individuals, mostly previously uninsured adults, and by 2020, the U.S. will face an estimated shortage of 91,000 physicians — particularly in low-income communities. Growing numbers of nurse practitioners and physician assistants will compensate for part of this shortage. Nurse practitioners already account for 27 percent of primary care providers nationally, and physician assistants account for 15 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. As of now, the foundation estimates nurse practitioners are the fastest growing segment of the primary care workforce, and physician assistants are not far behind.</p>\n<p>According to Health Affairs, a leading journal of health policy thought and research, “impending physician shortages in the United States will necessitate greater reliance on physician assistants and nurse practitioners, particularly in primary care.” The journal also included a survey that found approximately half the population prefers to have a physician as its primary care provider, but is perfectly amenable to seeing a nurse practitioner if physicians are unavailable for longer than a day.</p>\n<p>Jobs such as these are viable alternatives for students who may not want to work so many hours, as Kassner said they can typically give you “a little more control over your life and your lifestyle,” with their inclusion of “predictable” hours and schedules that are “more conducive to having a family life.” He said they can even allow for more interaction with patients. However, there are also plenty of other careers in the health sciences. Second-year biology major Laura Sena, for example, is thinking about going into nutrition. Although she decided not to go through with pre-med, she is still interested in entering another field within the health sciences.</p>\n<p>“I was thinking maybe nursing when I came here, but they don’t have some of the classes you need to become a nurse,” Sena said. “I knew I wanted to do something health-related, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go full-on med school.” The extended period of schooling required for becoming a doctor was another factor deterring Sena from the life of a med student. “I don’t want to be in school for another eight years,” Sena said. “If you wanted to start a family or something, you couldn’t really do that.” While cases of couples meeting in medical school and even raising families before they graduate exist, the stress of medical school can only complicate the lives of newlyweds and parents who are still getting the hang of changing diapers.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, pre-med is not for everyone. While UCSB has a reputable biology department and pretty strong pre-medical program, Tobolowsky said, success in these programs requires a student who is desperate to reach medical school. “I think the classes here really prepare you well and they’re very in depth, but most of all, it really depends on your approach to the courses,” he said. Saying he is perfectly willing to work hard, Tobolowsky said the sacrifices are well worth it, as is the need to “be nerdy,” because he cannot imagine anything else that would make him happier than becoming a doctor.</p>\n<p>Sitting at a glass table on the third floor of the Life Sciences Building, Tobolowsky looked down at the timer on his phone. One minute and 24 seconds later, he closed his biology textbook, stood up and went to check on his bacteria.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 3 of November 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53335\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53335\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/doctor-who-a-look-into-pre-med-competition/","id":3487,"author":{"id":191,"name":"Hannah Nelson"},"related":[3486,3485,3484],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/191"}},"__N_SSG":true}
