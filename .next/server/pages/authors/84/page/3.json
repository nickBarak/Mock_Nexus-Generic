Defacers spray painted the words “Free Palestine” across the front of it.</p>\n<p>Artists 4 Israel, an artist organization in support of Israel, began fixing the defaced sign Tuesday afternoon, adding the words “stop hate” across its entire surface.</p>\n<p>Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) proposed a resolution on April 23, urging A.S. to divest from companies that “occupy” Palestine territories. The A.S. Senate will vote on the resolution during tonight’s meeting in Corwin Pavilion.</p>\n<p>SJP specifically asks that UCSB and the UC Regents divest from Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard, although the group is asking the UC to divest from all companies that contribute to humans rights abuses in Palestine.</p>\n<p>UCSB A.S. is the only UC government that has not passed a divestment resolution in recent years.</p>\n<p>SJP released a statement on its Facebook page Wednesday morning “firmly and unequivocally” condemning the acts of vandalism and the accusations that SJP was affiliated with the incident.</p>\n<p>“Our group was in no way involved in this incident, and denounces vandalism of any student group’s displays,” the statement reads. “It would be foolish and inflammatory to lay blame upon this SJP for acts perpetrated by those who are not involved in our organization and act independently from us.”</p>\n<p>Nate Erez, the president of Students Supporting Israel and a fourth-year economics and accounting major, said he is not surprised the sign was defaced because “Free Palestine” was already written on the sign Friday in Sharpie.</p>\n<div

personally worked so hard to get these artists up here to create something positive for not only our community, but what we felt was the entire UCSB community,” Erez said.</p>\n<p>According to Erez, Artists 4 Israel wrote words such as “love” and “peace” in Arabic, Hebrew and English across the front of the sign and allowed student groups to write messages of love and unity on the back.</p>\n<p>UCSB student Jewish groups released a unity statement Monday in opposition to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS), a group supporting divestment from Israel.</p>\n<p>Erez said BDS “brings out anti-Semitism” on campuses across the nation and said divestment resolutions are “discriminatory” toward Jewish students and the religion.</p>\n<p>He said such resolutions and groups “single out” one side of the complex conflict between Israel and Palestine and place blame “solely and squarely on Israel.”</p>\n<p>“I believe you can be pro-Israel and pro-Palestine and pro-peace all at the same time,” Erez added. “And we should invest in peace, not boycott one side or the other.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

She said despite being “tough” and “blunt,” her emotional involvement in many issues guided her in the advocacy for students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“When I was running, my goal was to be the person that listened, and I actually feel like I did that,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her term, Ampaw communicated with other students who did not always share her</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I was definitely forced to shut up a lot, [and] I was forced to listen,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Ampaw, her biggest accomplishment was “opening the space” of the S.A.G. to women of color.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As the first black woman in the position, I didn’t realize how big of an impact that would be and how I would be able to be a strong voice for those communities and the diaspora,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I know I could have been a much stronger voice, and I would say that’s one of my biggest regrets, but I feel like I was able to pave a way,” she added.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">When running for the position, Ampaw’s platform included increasing student awareness of the A.S. budget and creating a counselor in OSA for students accused of plagiarism.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said while she was unable to push A.S. budget transparency as much as she had wanted, she did improve the visibility of OSA finances.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Students have been able to come to me and ask me what I am doing with my money, and I am able to tell them very transparently and honestly,” Ampaw said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said her plan to create a counselor for students accused of plagiarism was ultimately carried out by the Office of Judicial Affairs.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said prior to starting her term as S.A.G., she thought she would be “fighting alone” on behalf of students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I thought it was going to be me against A.S.,” Ampaw said. “Sometimes it was definitely me versus A.S. … but in a lot of moments, I realized that my staff had my back.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw’s staff included Catt Phan, her deputy chief of staff and a third-year global studies major. Phan said she loved working with Ampaw because she “never [lost] humor and resilience and compassion.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I have had a lot of faith in Josephine,” Phan said, “not only as a person but as someone who is in an exec position for the student government. Josephine just wants to serve the students.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Phan, the large OSA staff was “a lot to handle,” and it was oftentimes difficult to get the entire staff together for meetings. Phan said, however, the OSA office is “very sensitive” due to the types of student cases it addresses, and believes Ampaw was an experienced and qualified person to serve as S.A.G.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said she has personally changed throughout her term as S.A.G., having become more of an introvert and now finding less solace being with other people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I used to find so much rest from being around other people, but since being in this office, I find so much peace in being alone,” Ampaw said. “I thought I’d be a lot better being around other people.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said her term as S.A.G. has inspired her to become a social worker in the future. Additionally, after she graduates, Ampaw will travel to Colorado for a fellowship with AmeriCorps where she will help students who struggled in traditional school with their public speaking skills.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Looking toward next year, Ampaw said the next elected S.A.G. cannot be swayed by partisanship and must stay true to the nonpartisan nature of the office.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I also expect this person to have goals and to have aspirations for this office and really be able to express those to the entire association and entire campus,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ampaw said she is “really grateful” for the opportunity to have served as S.A.G. and wants to remind current A.S. candidates they hold an important place on campus.</p>\n<p>“For the people who are running, I would just want to say to them that the work is hard, but the work is totally worth it in the end,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.5 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77400\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77400\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-27/term-in-review-student-advocate-general-josephine-ampaw/","id":3957,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3956,3955,3954],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Term in Review: Internal Vice President Natalie Jordan","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2017-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-27-at-3.54.24-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-27-at-3.54.24-PM.png?resize=608%2C579&ssl=1","description":"The Nexus has compiled profiles of our current elected officials to reflect on their past year in office.

Fellowship Program and changing the dynamic of the senate through the implementation of i&gt;clickers in the voting process.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said IVP is “kind of a silent, behind-the-scenes job” because the primary functions of the position are to run senate meetings, maintain the internal functions of the association and work on its own projects.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She is most proud of her work to expand the A.S. Fellowship, which allows students to become fellows to A.S. senators and executives and learn about the inner workings of the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, 100 students applied to be fellows and 66 were chosen. She added that many fellows are running for A.S. positions in this election.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is what I wanted it to be,” Jordan said. “I wanted it to be somewhere people could actually learn about the internal functions of the association before diving into a role.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her campaign for IVP, Jordan stressed her interest in working with freshmen to increase their engagement with A.S. While she does not know how to gauge the effectiveness of her efforts, Jordan said she tabled in residence halls and reached out to freshmen in the Summer Start Program and during Week of Welcome. She hopes the work she did encouraged freshmen to join A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During her time as IVP, Jordan was charged with leading senate meetings, which at times could become disorderly when senators disagreed on issues or when controversial topics were discussed at public forum.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In November, the senate moved its meeting into Corwin Pavilion from its normal Flying A Room in the UCen as it planned to vote on a resolution that would allow conservative orator Ben Shapiro to speak on campus. The meeting lasted six hours, and the senate voted to approve the resolution.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, she was able to maintain a stable climate during the meeting because she established agreements and rules everyone had to adhere to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also said while public forums can cause tensions to run high and extend senate meetings, she thinks it is “really beautiful” when so many students come to voice their concerns to the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The biggest part about that is when someone comes to talk to the senators, I think as an exec or as a senator, people forget that these people are taking time out of their day-to-day schedules to come and speak,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Whatever they’re talking about is a part of their reality, so in a situation where a senate meeting goes for six hours, it’s not something people can see as something bad, but in reality more students are engaged in the issues,” she added.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Nushi Yapabandara, a third-year philosophy major, ran against Jordan for IVP in the A.S. election last spring. She said she “commends” Jordan for the way she has handled the senate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara said she hopes next year’s IVP is “able to maintain the level of strictness and discipline and respect that Natalie has … made a standard in senate meetings.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said many unexpected projects arose during her term that were not on her campaign platform, including the creation of an A.S. orientation program, which acts as a guide to those first introduced to the association, as well as the projects that fellows in the fellowship program took on themselves.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She was most excited about the designation of an A.S. liaison from Counseling and Psychological Services to be available with students who work within A.S.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, A.S. is a “lifestyle” and students make choices and sacrifices based on their involvement in the association.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A lot of students, because of how taxing it can be, were experiencing a lot of mental health stresses,” Jordan said. “And I can totally understand that; I’ve been there.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said the designated liaison has done group sessions with the senate, attends senate meetings and has been involved in the current elections by checking in with the candidates’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan also reflected on the projects she hoped to do but was unable to complete, including bringing food trucks in the Arbor during finals week and using i&gt;clickers during senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, university administrations halted the plan for food trucks. She said when she realized her i&gt;clicker plan would not work, she altered the goal to eventually attain a more permanent space for senate meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The IVP said that at the beginning of her term, she was “so bad at delegating,” which posed a learning curve for her as she settled into IVP.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’m kind of a controlling person and I want things to go my way … because I think sometimes I understand the greater picture, and it’s very naive of me to think that and I realize that,” Jordan said. “Sometimes I realize that instead of controlling a situation, it’s better to let others take a shot at it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Yapabandara, who worked as Jordan’s director of programming during Fall Quarter, said she recognized Jordan’s struggle to give other staff members tasks as she “gunned through” and tried to do everything herself.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Yapabandara, this hindered Jordan’s ability to complete all the projects she wanted to.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I feel like she could have been a lot more transparent and accessible to everyone,” Yapabandara said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said that after her time as IVP, she has realized that the position is “experiential learning.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“No matter how much preparation you’ve had before or experience with this community, there’s really no way to learn how to manage an association of over 800 students overnight,” she said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to Jordan, the next elected IVP needs to focus on preserving a stable environment at senate meetings. She attributes her ability to handle the senate to the fact that she was an independent executive and “never had to play any games with anyone.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I think the next IVP needs to make sure they’re maintaining an unbiased viewpoint and also [make] sure that they’re really checking in with everyone and maintaining a really positive climate,” Jordan said. “You can only do so much, but trying at least matters.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As her time as IVP comes to an end and A.S. election season is almost over, Jordan said she loved the chance to be a “change-maker” in the association and now understands more about herself and her capabilities.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sleep is way overrated,” Jordan said. “Four hours a night is the slumber of champions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Jordan said after her term is complete, she will continue her position as vice president of the Isla Vista Community Service District as well as her full-time job as the senior event coordinator at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>A version of this story appeared on p.4 of the Thursday, April 26, 2017, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77393\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77393\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-26/term-in-review-internal-vice-president-natalie-jordan/","id":3955,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3954,3953,3952],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Paranoid?

The cameras are purchased by the department and, according to Howard, typically cost between $300 and $1,200.</p>\n<p>There is not, however, a thorough policy in place that outlines the steps taken to install a camera, and the university is currently in the process of drafting a new policy for installing security cameras. The university’s latest policy was created in May 2008.</p>\n<p>Matthew Hall, associate vice chancellor and chief information officer, said that under current policy, camera footage is accessed and monitored by each department that owns the camera. The footage is only released during police investigations or when there is compelling interest to uncover what was filmed.</p>\n<p>Hall noted that the university is in the process of creating a new policy to specifically outline the regulation of camera use.</p>\n<p>“It’ll vary by various departments, and this is a reason why we’ve started the dialogue,” Hall said. “We want a policy that says, ‘If you’re going to manage a camera, there are practices and standards to which you have to adhere that balance privacy, safety and security.’”</p>\n<p>The group drafting the new university policy was created around four months ago and consists of law enforcement, university administrators, university staff members and Jennifer Lofthus, the chief of information and security officer.</p>\n<p>The UC Office of the President is also creating a new system-wide policy change.</p>\n<p>According to Hall, security cameras pose an “ethical burden” due to controversy between increasing surveillance and maintaining people’s privacy. He also described them as a “monetary burden” because individual departments pay for their installed cameras.</p>\n<p>Hall noted that the installation of security cameras undergoes a different process for interior and exterior cameras, as “staff issues and union issues” may arise when such groups deny access to being filmed inside buildings.</p>\n<p>“We have to consider there are certain labor classifications that explicitly prohibit this particular thing,” he said.</p>\n<p>Hall said he wants the future policy to include a requirement to attend a privacy training for those who request cameras to learn how “to respect the privacy of our community.”</p>\n<p>Many students may not be aware of security cameras, and Hall said the new policy will designate more signage to show students where they are being surveilled.</p>\n<p>Hall said he estimates that the policy will be completed by the end of the calendar year.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got to get everybody to a similar standard,” Hall said. “The policy is deliberate and thoughtful, and we want to make sure there’s time for review and there’s time for dissemination and there’s time for criticism.”</p>\n<p>Ruby Stewart, a first-year psychology major, was studying on the fourth floor of the library when she noticed the security camera hovering above her.</p>\n<p>“I honestly didn’t know there was cameras,” she said. “I don’t feel uncomfortable, though, because I feel like it kind of makes sense. I feel like if they’re misusing it, just to kind of like, watch us, that’s creepy. But if they have like a purpose, then it’s fine with me.”</p>\n<p>Stewart said she thinks the cameras would be useful if there were a crime in the library, but she said students should be more aware of the cameras’ presence on campus.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t know … so obviously there should be more signs,” she said. “Because if you have signs, people will say, ‘Oh, there’s cameras, I shouldn’t do anything stupid in here.’”</p>\n<p>According to Gary Johnson, the associate university librarian for research and scholar services, there are cameras on every floor of the library, the majority being on the first floor due to the amount of general and emergency exits.</p>\n<p>Hall said he wants to remind students that they are “under constant personal surveillance in the world,” and the presence of cameras on a university campus is typical due to the high volume of visitors and amount of expensive infrastructure and research equipment.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying to clarify [students’] rights through policy,” Hall said. “The university has not only a right but a compelling interest in surveilling an area to make sure you’re safe and to make sure our property is protected.”</p>\n<p>Abigail Hunt, a first-year biology major, said she doesn’t mind having cameras on campus because they act as a “safety precaution.”</p>\n<p>“It makes me feel safe, like if something did happen they’d be able to record it,” Hunt said. “But I don’t feel the need to know where things are because I don’t feel like I do anything that I should worried about being watched.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story

The first question pertained to the use of hate speech on campus, while the second one asked the candidates how they plan to work with the administration to achieve their goals as senators.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates were given 30 seconds for opening and closing remarks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidates explained to audience members their plans for improving the lives of UCSB students. Here are some of the highlights:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Al-Anbar, a third-year anthropology major, said she wants to “pioneer” a transfer commission and help marginalized students feel more represented on campus. She said she believes that while there is a constitutional right to free speech, the university should “not entertain” hate speech and help maintain an environment free from violence.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maalizadeh, a third-year biology major, said he wants to improve CLAS access for transfer students and expand transfer orientation, two issues he wants to work on with the university administrators. He said it is an “amazing time” to be a transfer student, and he wants to focus his efforts on increasing support for them. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carey, a second-year global studies and geography double major, said he wants to use his “passion for academics” and “ability to strive as a leader” to serve his community. According to Carey, hate speech should not be tolerated on campus, and he hopes he can “use existing channels” of communication with campus administrators to achieve his goals as a senator.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hernandez, a third-year political science major, said she wants students to know how A.S. can affect change on campus. She also said she wants to “streamline” the dialogue between A.S. and university administrators and work to decrease tuition and increase class enrollment availability. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kopel, a second-year political science major, said she wants to ensure that student fees are seen through student resources. Kopel said she believes hate speech can make some students “feel alienated” on campus and wants to help facilitate productive dialogue between differing groups. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banicki, a first-year biology major, said he wants to create more outdoor study spaces and hammocks on campus. He also said he wants to emphasize mental health and extend resources to students who may feel overwhelmed. As the president of the Santa Catalina South Residence Hall, he said he already “has a foot in the door” to work with university administrators. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martinez, a second-year sociology and economics double major, said she wants to increase representation of minority groups on campus. If elected, she said, she hopes to make college life more affordable and accessible to students.      </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uemura, a first-year chemistry major, said she wants to implement a mental health counselor for CCS and ensure an open dialogue with campus administrators. She said she believes there is a “fine line” between hate speech and free speech and said she hopes to maintain CCS as a “very safe space” that is welcome to everyone.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almas, a second-year chemical engineering major, said he wants to work on making college more affordable for students, citing the high costs of tutoring and textbooks. He said he wants to create an open dialogue with administrators to ensure that the College of Engineering can be a safe and affordable environment.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diamond, a second-year electrical engineering major, said he is excited about the future of A.S. and wants to increase students’ awareness about the university’s “incredible” resources including UCIV and the Community Housing Office. He said he believes engineers are underrepresented and wants to increase mental health resources for them. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaigning for A.S. Elections began Sunday and will continue for the next two weeks until voting results are announced on the night of April 27.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profiles of all 51 A.S.

class=\"wp-caption-text\">Congressman Salud Carbajal spoke at UCSB on Monday about the difficulty of passing Democratic legislation in a Republican-majority Congress. <em>Anthony Lai/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Carbajal expressed hesitant hope for progressive legislation under the Trump administration but attempted to ensure the town hall attendees that he would do what he could despite being a Democrat in a Republican-majority congress.</p>\n<p>The congressman has sponsored or co-sponsored over 60 bills since being elected to Congress in November and said 25 of the bills have been bipartisan.</p>\n<p>“I still believe there’s always room for collaboration,” he said, despite the currently divided political climate.</p>\n<p>The town hall, hosted by the Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board, was divided into three sections of discussion: the environment, education and immigration. Many of the attendees’ concerns focused on how the Trump administration’s new and proposed policies would impact these issues.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed a student’s question regarding how he would combat the president’s budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of research and development. He said he would continue to “speak out” against harmful legislation.</p>\n<p>“The reality is that I am in the minority party right now, and one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House,” Carbajal said. “So what we can do is put forth legislation, which oftentimes cannot move forward, and develop bipartisan support to bring it forward for a hearing to bring it to the floor.”</p>\n<p>Many students asked questions about issues affecting students, including food insecurity, tuition and loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said since Trump’s proposed budget cuts funding to programs that help combat students’ food insecurity, he has sponsored an appropriations bill request for more funding for food banks.</p>\n<p>Carbajal went on to address college tuition hikes and the advent of paying off student loans after graduation. The congressman, a UCSB alumnus, said he still has not paid off all his student loans.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said he has supported an appropriations bill to increase the Pell Grant and make access to the grant year round. He also said he wants to work on lowering the interest rates attached to student loans.</p>\n<p>“The interest rates … are really high, and I think we need to stop the profiteering by certain financial institutions on the backs of students trying to get a college education,” Carbajal said.</p>\n<p>Carbajal addressed the issue of immigration last, sharing that his father immigrated to the United States from Mexico back “when immigration worked.”</p>\n<p>He said the immigration system no longer works and needs comprehensive reform and the creation of a clear path to citizenship.</p>\n<p>Carbajal said it is challenging to introduce Democratic legislation in the current Congress because oftentimes Republicans block the legislation from moving forward to the floor.</p>\n<p>He said, however, that constituents still can influence policies when they vocalize their concerns, noting the way the Republicans failed to pass their alternative to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>“I remind you that when you believe in these issues and sometimes feel a little powerless and you question whether your advocacy … works, look what happened with the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “That happened because people spoke up.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

id=\"caption-attachment-76914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The building, located between Broida Hall and the UCSB Library, has been plagued by dry rot, damage from insects and steel beam corrosion. <em>Jose Arturo Ochoa / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>After an inspection of the building by Van Sande Structural Consultants, campus building official Ed Schmittgen notified the university on Jan. 9 that the building was no longer safe due to dry rot, insect damage, steel beam corrosion and an inadequate amount of ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor.</p>\n<p>Schmittgen said there was also not enough seismic bracing within the building.</p>\n<p>Seismic bracing “prevents a building from moving laterally during a seismic event,” he said in an email.</p>\n<p>Such problems could weaken the building’s structure and lead to earthquake vulnerability, he said. The university informed students that they needed to evacuate the building within 45 days.</p>\n<p>The building is over 40 years old and serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, Mujer de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began during the week of Feb. 13 and concluded over Spring Break, the university has added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building. These structures make the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes.</p>\n<p>“We essentially have more assurance now that the building is structurally stable than prior to this effort,” Schmittgen said.</p>\n<p>The addition of the concrete pillars has decreased the seismic risk of the building and is one of the steps stabilizing the building. The building will need further adjustments to fix a rotting part of the floor and the foundation of the building, which has suffered water damage.</p>\n<p>The remaining reparations will take place over the summer so students can continue to use El Centro throughout Spring Quarter. Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said the administration is working with a group of students from El Centro to plan out the details of the project.</p>\n<p>“The seismic stabilization had to happen right away in order to keep the building in use this year, but the other part of the renovation, we’re outlining the scope of the project right now,” Klawunn said.</p>\n<p>According to Klawunn, pressure from the student groups that use El Centro prompted the administration to reconsider its options for the building’s future. Associated Students Senate passed a bill on Jan. 18 urging the university to preserve the historical building.</p>\n<p>“What really made the difference was students saying, ‘We don’t want the building out of commission,’” Klawunn said. “So then Design and Construction went back to see if there is any solution to this that could keep the building in operation.”</p>\n<p>Klawunn said the new solution was not driven by finances or the cost of a demolition project but rather by “what makes the most sense.” She said the plan allows students to access the building for the duration of the quarter.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 5 of the Thursday, April 13, 2017 print issue of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-13/admins-opt-to-repair-el-centro/","id":2402,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2401,2400,2399],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Mourns Loss of ‘Selfless’ Grad Student","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-04-06T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-06-at-5.25.51-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-shot-2017-04-06-at-5.25.51-PM.png?resize=661%2C468&ssl=1","description":"Samuel “Sam” Boldissar died on March 25 while rock climbing in Joshua Tree.

He was always rock climbing, always.”</p>\n<p>Jordan Hughes was a housemate of Boldissar and met him in 2014 when they began graduate school at UCSB. He said Boldissar came from a “family of climbers.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar enjoyed rock climbing, backpacking and camping. He also loved the Red Hot Chili Peppers, cooking and brewing his own beer.</p>\n<p>Hughes said Boldissar was “true to his own tastes” and interested in a variety of different things.</p>\n<p>“He spent his time on things he found intrinsically interesting,” Hughes said in an email. “He wasn’t in grad school for the degree. He did it because the problems he worked on were important and interesting to him.”</p>\n<p>A problem solver, Hughes said Boldissar once created a skunk trap in their backyard in Isla Vista. One night, he went to check on the trap and a skunk wandered into the house through the opened door.</p>\n<p>“Lots of yelling ensued and we miraculously avoided getting skunk spray in our house, but we did decide that the best defense was probably just to keep the door shut,” Hughes said in an email.</p>\n<p>Haley Snyder was Boldissar’s neighbor in Isla Vista and said “the best” she saw Boldissar was when they would sit in the living room “singing and playing drums.”</p>\n<p>“There’s not many people that you’re going to meet that were as genuine or as kind as Sam,” Snyder said.</p>\n<p>As an undergraduate transfer student at UCSB, Boldissar lived with seven other Isla Vistans: Patrick Sheehan, Paul Mazzella, Mike Wood, Tyler Rowe, Shelby Hendricks, Lewis Durand and Erik Romelfanger.</p>\n<p>Sheehan said the group lived together on the 68-block of Sabado.</p>\n<p>Sheehan and Mazzella explained how they once wrote a song for Boldissar titled, “Sammy Come Home,” because he was always working on campus at the Chemistry lab.</p>\n<p>“We ended up singing [the song] for the rest of the year and it sort of resonates right now,” Mazzella said.</p>\n<p>“We’d play it for him all the time and he’d think it was funny,” Sheehan added. “And now Sam has passed away and we want Sammy to come home. We loved him so much and wanted him around so much that we wrote a song about it.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca described Boldissar as “selfless” and said he “really just wanted to help anyone in need.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca said she and Boldissar went to Big Bear with friends and he helped a group of people get their car out of a ditch on the icy road.</p>\n<p>“Sam just walked over without a second thought … to go help these people, and he just got on the bumper and started pushing as hard as he could,” she said. “He’s the reason the car got out of the ditch. He did things like that all the time.”</p>\n<p>Rebecca and Boldissar were together for six months and she said they enjoyed taking walks on the beach and introducing each other to the things they each liked to do.</p>\n<p>Boldissar took Rebecca to the Santa Barbara Rock Gym and went to musicals like “Beauty and the Beast” because Rebecca loves musicals.</p>\n<p>Professor de Vries described Boldissar as “brilliant” and always willing to help other students in the research group with their own projects.</p>\n<p>“He was very good but in a humble way,” de Vries said. “He was involved in every project in the lab and helped every other student in the group.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar worked on multiple projects in the research group, and his most recent projects are being compiled for publication.</p>\n<p>“It’s wonderful his name is going to be in publications and in scientific journals,” Rebecca said. “I’m glad people are going to see the hard work he did.”</p>\n<p>Professor de Vries said he wants Boldissar to be remembered “with a smile.”</p>\n<p>“He always had this smile and everybody in our group is touched by him,” de Vries said. “He’s been so influential … [and] he had no idea how smart he was. There was never any showing off. It was just that smile.”</p>\n<p>Boldissar’s funeral will be held on April 22 at 11 a.m. at Redondo Union High School.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Thursday, April 6, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/ucsb-mourns-loss-of-selfless-grad-student/","id":2423,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2422,2421,2420],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Report Shows Stability in I.V.

Despite the increase from the last year, Chuck Flacks, executive director of C3H, said the homeless population has remained “remarkably stable” in recent years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said because Isla Vista has “a very small sample” of people who are homeless, the 37 percent increase only reflects “one or two” more people coming in to I.V. since 2016.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We did see a small increase, but it wasn’t a huge increase, and the reality is that things have remained fairly stable,” Flacks said. “Population stays consistent as a result of homeless outreach and housing for the homeless.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks said the “consistent” numbers are likely a result of homeless outreach organizations in Isla Vista such as the Pescadero Lofts, a complex that opened in 2014 to help keep homeless community members off the streets. The complex currently houses 35 people. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Flacks, the Pescadero Lofts are “proof” that through community outreach, counties can reduce the amount of people who are homeless living in an area. The Pescadero Lofts offer counseling for people as well as an alcohol and drug program.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The C3H report also showed that 33 percent of unsheltered people have health insurance, which Flack attributed to the Affordable Care Act.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Under the Affordable Care Act, we saw a huge expansion of people who are homeless getting access to Medi-Cal,” Flacks said. “Typically, we encourage them to go to primary health providers who accept Medi-Cal, and we’ve had a lot of success, seeing fewer people dying on the streets as a result of that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks said, however, that many people who are homeless are worried about how lawmakers at the  federal government are  proposing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Flacks, Isla Vista is one of the “poorest communities in the county” and said the results of the homeless census do not account for the countless people who are “unstably housed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He said the need for affordable housing is “critical” when there are residents couchsurfing or living in doubled and tripled rooms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The census] is a baseline of the total homeless and potentially homeless population in I.V.,” he said. “The biggest problem — and that’s a countywide concern — is access to affordable housing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flacks emphasized that aiding homeless community members can only reduce the homeless population. He said people who are homeless are reminders that “our system is not working” in regard to mental health and alcohol and drug treatment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Homeless people are like the canary in the coal mine for our society, and they’re a visible reminder of neglect,” Flacks said. “So when we have more people on the street, it means we’re doing something wrong.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print

href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in March that 124 UC staff and faculty members were accused of violating Title IX between January 2013 and April 2016. Of the six UCSB staff and faculty accused, all investigations were conducted under old Title IX policy from 2013, according to UCSB spokesperson Andrea Estrada.</p>\n<p>UC sexual harassment policy underwent its latest change in January 2016, after UC President Janet Napolitano organized the Task Force in 2014 on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault. The Task Force was comprised of committees dedicated to revising multiple aspects of the policy.</p>\n<p>Title IX is a federal state law ensuring that all students have the opportunity to participate in federally funded educational programs without discrimination based on sex. The law can apply to cases of sexual misconduct and assault and any university-affiliated organization, including sports groups and admissions.</p>\n<p>Of the six UCSB investigations, one faculty member received a salary reduction, and the university required another to attend sexual harassment training and personal counseling. Two cases ended with the termination of an employee.</p>\n<p>In other cases, the Title IX office substantiated the claims, but the university took no further disciplinary action as far as documents show.</p>\n<p>Estrada said in an email that it is “too speculative” to conclude if these case investigations would have resulted differently under the 2016 policy revisions.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Salvaty, the UC Title IX coordinator, also said she could not know if an outcome of a case would have been different under the revised policy, but she said the new policy changes would improve Title IX for future cases.</p>\n<p>“I can say that the current policy, and the recommended changes the campuses are implementing, have strengthened the University’s processes and procedures,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_76141\" style=\"width: 908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-76141\" data-attachment-id=\"76141\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-02/documents-show-6-ucsb-employees-violated-title-ix-policy/title-ix-graphic-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=898%2C426&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"898,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"title ix graphic 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?fit=888%2C421&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76141\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=888%2C421\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?w=898&amp;ssl=1 898w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=250%2C119&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/title-ix-graphic-1.jpg?resize=768%2C364&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-76141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Adjustments made to the policy did, however, alter the way the UC investigates student and employee cases.</p>\n<p>According to Salvaty, under the new policy, Title IX officers review student-on-student sexual violence claims under the same procedures across all UC campuses.</p>\n<p>Employee-related cases also underwent “important provisions,” including the requirements that investigations must be concluded within 60 days, both the complainant and the respondent must be notified of the investigation’s outcome and the complainant must be informed of the repercussions imposed on the respondent.</p>\n<p>“Those are some big changes that come to mind,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>While Salvaty could not speak about specific cases, she said cases reviewed under the older policy could not be reconsidered a second time, even though policies have changed.</p>\n<p>“I assume that if a matter was investigated and adjudicated under a then existing process, it could not be investigated again under a new process,” Salvaty said in an email.</p>\n<p>Salvaty said, however, that consequences for violators may differ depending on each university because decisions on penalties are decided upon by the supervisors of each case at the university, not the Title IX officers and investigators.</p>\n<p>This can result in varied forms of punishment for UC staff and faculty members.</p>\n<p>The UCOP Task Force recommended that each UC campus increase sexual harassment and assault training amongst staff and faculty and create a Campus, Advocacy, Resources and Education (C.A.R.E.) Advocate on each campus to help survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment, which UCSB has instated. They also recommend the development of a campus Peer Review Committee to review final investigation reports and advise the chancellor on disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>The UC campuses are currently in the process of implementing all the Task Force’s recommendations.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, March 9, print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-76340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-76340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-03-09/title-ix-outcomes-reviewed/","id":2415,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2414,2413,2412],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Loses ‘Goofy, Caring’ Student","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-12.21.10-PM.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-shot-2017-03-02-at-12.21.10-PM.png?resize=863%2C622&ssl=1","description":"A UC Santa Barbara global studies major died in his sleep on Feb. 15 in his Santa Barbara home.

She said Anthony Tsang saved up his allowance to buy her a stuffed animal panda that she wanted for her sixth birthday.</p>\n<p>“He remembered that I wanted it, and he went back to buy it for me,” she said. “So it’s just like little things that I didn’t really think about at the time but now when I go back, it just really matters to me.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang also said her brother was incredibly selfless and always looking out for others.</p>\n<p>“After he passed away, a bunch of his friends came out with stories about him and a lot of things he did, I never knew about, and a lot of us never knew about, that showed how selfless he was,” she said.</p>\n<p>Michelle Lew, Tony’s fiancée, said they did everything together.</p>\n<p>“He was my best friend, the one I shared everything with,” Lew said. “Since the day we met, for two years, we only spent maybe a total of five nights apart.”</p>\n<p>Lew said Anthony could brighten anyone’s day and was able to connect with those around him through his diverse interests and cheerful personality.</p>\n<p>“He was really, for lack of a better word, goofy. He was always messing around, always the silly one, trying to make people laugh,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>Lew and Anthony Tsang lived in Santa Barbara together after meeting on Tinder in San Jose two years ago. They owned two Jack-Russell-Chihuahua mixes and enjoyed going to Arroyo Burro Beach together with their dogs.</p>\n<p>“The big thing that stuck out was how we met, because we actually met on Tinder. So that was a one-in-a-million thing,” Lew said. “The first thing that he messaged me was a pick up line, which was: ‘I’m looking for my next wife on Tinder.’”</p>\n<p>Lew said a year after they met, they were engaged and planned to marry after they finished college.</p>\n<p>“Everything just fit together by random chance,” Lew said.</p>\n<p>In high school, Anthony Tsang was on the cross country team with his friend, Jonathan Wyatt. The two were friends all throughout high school.</p>\n<p>Wyatt described Anthony Tsang as “curious and mischievous … but also extremely charismatic and caring for other people.”</p>\n<p>“It was quite an interesting combination … but it honestly made him a really fun person, and I enjoyed spending a lot of time with him,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang was always getting into trouble in high school and said once he and Anthony Tsang attempted to steal an old computer out of a shed on the high school campus.</p>\n<p>Wyatt said even though the scheme was his idea, Anthony Tsang took most of the blame after they were caught.</p>\n<p>“It was the most ridiculous thing ever, so funny,” Wyatt said. “And Tony was like, man, this always happens to me.” It was great, and honestly I’d give anything just to relive those days again.”</p>\n<p>Wyatt said Anthony Tsang’s other friends would describe him as “someone you could count on, no matter what it was.”</p>\n<p>“I think the fact that we could always count on him really was like one of the bigger takeaways from his personality because no matter what situation you were in … he wasn’t really one to judge people,” Wyatt said.</p>\n<p>Wyatt also said he admired Anthony Tsang’s adventurous personality, which made a “huge impact” on his own high school experience.</p>\n<p>“He never really had a stop button. It was always go go go,” Wyatt said. “It was very different from how most people live their life, I feel.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother wanted to be a U.S. ambassador to Mexico because he “really loved it.”</p>\n<p>He traveled to Mexico on vacation multiple times with Lew, and Anthony Tsang said he loved how “nice” and “chill” everyone was there.</p>\n<p>According to Lew, Anthony Tsang was a “big beer enthusiast,” which she said might have contributed to his love of Mexico.</p>\n<p>“He liked … just how everyone is so easygoing,” Lew said. “He liked just sitting on the beach and going in the ocean. He liked how friendly everyone was, just something about Mexico’s culture … he was comfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Lew and her fiancé traveled to Canada, Las Vegas and Mexico together. They planned to visit Hawaii and backpack through Europe.</p>\n<p>Anthony Tsang enjoyed listening to EDM, country and indie rock music and was a Dallas basketball and football fan. He liked to draw and snowboard and loved cars, especially Porsches.</p>\n<p>“A couple weeks ago, we went to Porsche, and he was super excited because he got to test drive one,” Lew said. “We went back two days later for me to test drive cars, but then he test drove it again.”</p>\n<p>Tiana Tsang said her brother was always willing to try new things and lived a carefree life.</p>\n<p>“He always wanted to experience life as much as possible, and I know it sounds really cheesy, but that’s honestly just the kind of person he was,” Tiana Tsang said. “And one thing that I really say is that, like, he really lived more life in his 23 years than some people do in their whole entire lives.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, March 2, 2017, print edition of

access to inmates’ personal information in the jail computers and databases, such as immigration status.</p>\n<p>While the Lobby Corps began the project last December, the Central Coast Immigration Rights Coalition (CCIRC) has been discussing I.C.E. with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office (SBSO) for the past three years. Bill Brown is the current Sheriff.</p>\n<p>In addition to the UCSB Lobby Corps, Santa Barbara City College, Allan Hancock College and Westmont College have been assisting CCIRC.</p>\n<p>According to Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson, I.C.E. enforces immigration laws in the county and has a workspace in the county jail with access to inmates’ information.</p>\n<p>Jails, separate from prisons, are holding facilities used to confine people serving sentences for misdemeanors, awaiting trial or sentencing on either felony or misdemeanor charges or confined for civil matters.</p>\n<p>I.C.E. and jails work under the Truth Act, statewide legislation that creates more transparency in interactions between SBSO, I.C.E. and inmates.</p>\n<p>The Truth Act ensures that people in jail are aware of their rights to due process, legal counsel and that records relating to I.C.E. access must be open to the public.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if local law enforcement chooses to notify I.C.E. about an inmate’s release, the person and their attorney or designee must be notified of their release date and time as well.</p>\n<p>While organizations like CCIRC and Lobby Corps hope for an increase in strict enforcement of the Truth Act, they are lobbying to completely remove I.C.E. from prisons.</p>\n<p>Daniel Torres, a second-year history of public policy major and an organizer for Lobby Corps, said SBSO has been open about its “working relationship” with I.C.E., but said the Lobby Corps wants to “sever that connection” between the local jails and I.C.E.</p>\n<p>According to Frank Rodriguez, organizer of the Santa Barbara California Immigrant Policy Center which operates CCIRC, the county supervisors provide the funds and resources to the county jails.</p>\n<p>If CCIRC and the Lobby Corps can convince SBSO to limit I.C.E.’s work in the jails, county supervisors would then have the ability to restrict I.C.E.’s access to the jail’s computers and databases.</p>\n<p>Torres said the Lobby Corps and other organizations plan to work with Santa Barbara County Supervisors, and has already met with Fifth District Supervisor Steve Lavagnino to discuss the project.</p>\n<p>Lavagnino said, however, that although he disagrees with some immigration decisions made by the federal government, he believes immigration agents have an important role in county jails.</p>\n<p>“I thought everybody would agree that those that come to this country and have committed serious felonies, I thought everybody would approve of them being returned to their country,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Torres and Rodriguez, if the lobbying efforts are effective, the group could be discussing the next steps of the project with supervisors by March or April.</p>\n<p>Torres said it is important to work with the county supervisors and SBSO to “make sure undocumented stories are heard … and taken into account.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, February 16, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senators Bianca Fernandez and Batsheva Stoll first proposed the resolution to the Senate on Jan. 18. It passed Wednesday 21 to 2.</p>\n<p>The IIE Syria Consortium is a scholarship program designed to allocate admission space at universities to refugees whose education has been halted by the Syrian War. The Consortium aims to help refugee students continue their education at universities so they can eventually return to Syria and begin rebuilding their communities.</p>\n<p>Syrian students are unable to continue their education in Syria because their campuses are either destroyed or unsafe. The war has displaced over four million people, with as many as 450,000 between the ages of 18 and 22.</p>\n<p>The resolution was originally brought to the senators by Books Not Bombs, a campaign that encourages universities to join the IIE Syria Consortium. The same resolution has been proposed at other UC campuses and at the UC Student Association.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be the fourth school in the UC system to petition the Regents to join the Consortium, following Davis, Irvine and Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Bianca Fernandez, off-campus senator and second-year history of public policy major, said the university’s participation in the IIE Syria Consortium would show that UCSB is supportive of refugee students and their higher education.</p>\n<p>“Having the UC system give that opportunity and be that school that will help, indirectly, Syria rebuild itself [is] super important, and I think it’s a very progressive step for our school,” she said.</p>\n<p>The Syrian students’ financial aid will come from funding that is already reserved for international students, so U.S. students will not be affected by the resolution.</p>\n<p>However, Syrian students will receive priority admission to the university over other international students due to the severity of their country’s crisis.</p>\n<p>The resolution was drafted before President Trump’s immigration ban, which complicates the process of Syrian students getting to UCSB. The president’s executive order temporarily bans immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and proposes the indefinite suspension of Syrian refugees from entering the country.</p>\n<p>Fernandez said she believes the resolution is still valuable despite Trump’s order because it demonstrates the university’s dedication to continuing the education of refugee students.</p>\n<p>“I still think it is super important that the UC system, especially UCSB, shows that we are accepting of Syrian refugees and we want to have a space for them on this campus,” she said. “We think it’s very important that students in Syria receive the higher education that they deserve.”</p>\n<p>The president’s immigration ban is currently being reviewed for constitutionality by federal judges. The executive order was temporarily blocked last Friday by a federal judge from Seattle.</p>\n<p>Fernandez said Syrian students’ presence at UCSB will provide “different viewpoints” on campus and make the campus “an even better place.”</p>\n<p>“They’ll make our campus more diverse and I think that’s something our campus is really proud of,” she said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on

bill “Statue of Liberty Values Act,” which aims to block federal funding for President Trump’s seven-nation immigration ban. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Congressman Salud Carbajal has co-sponsored a bill that would defund President Donald Trump’s immigration ban, adding his name to a list of California legislators taking action against the executive order.</p>\n<p>Trump announced his travel ban last Friday, halting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the intake of refugees from Syria.</p>\n<p>Carbajal, who represents California’s 24th District, is co-sponsoring a bill introduced by California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren titled “Statue of Liberty Values (SOLVE) Act,” which would eradicate and block all federal funding for Trump’s executive order.</p>\n<p>“Our country’s safety and national security is paramount,” Carbajal stated in a press release on Monday. “President Trump’s overly broad executive order only serves to fuel anti-American sentiment and propaganda, putting our national security at risk.”</p>\n<p>According to the press release, Carbajal believes the executive order “demonstrates dangerous and irresponsible leadership” because it “developed hastily” and was not thoroughly discussed with national security agencies.</p>\n<p>Tess Whittlesey, communications director for Congressman Carbajal, said the Senate majority is refusing to bring the bill to the floor for consideration because Republicans, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, are in favor of the president’s order.</p>\n<p>However, Whittlesey said it is “important to be a strong advocate” for immigrant communities, even if the bill does not move forward.</p>\n<p>“He’s here fighting for Central Coast values no matter what the odds are of legislation getting picked up,” Whittlesey said. “It’s what he believes in, and he’s going to keep fighting for those values here in Washington.”</p>\n<p>Austin Hechler, Associated Students (A.S.) president and fourth-year political science major, said Carbajal’s actions demonstrate how California is “extremely diverse and inclusive.”</p>\n<p>State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, chair of the California Senate Judiciary Committee, said she admires Carbajal’s sponsorship of the bill and his condemnation of Trump’s “outrageous behavior.”</p>\n<p>“Our system of government has checks and balances, and I think it’s critically important that the Congress, which is one of those checks and balances, does, in fact, do its job,” Jackson said. “I appreciate Congressman Carbajal … and I believe every congressmember willing to follow the Constitution and their oath of office should be doing the same.”</p>\n<p>The California Senate Judiciary Committee passed Senate Resolution 16 on Monday, which condemns Trump’s ban as a “discriminatory overreach” and urges the president to revoke the executive order. The resolution also asked the Department of Homeland Security to allow immigrant detainees access to legal counsel “as quickly as feasible.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the committee met Tuesday to discuss three bills that would provide legal assistance for immigrants facing deportation, outlaw local law enforcement from investigating someone based on immigration status and prohibit state agencies from disclosing a person’s religious affiliation to the federal government.</p>\n<p>Jackson said constituents have expressed concern to her about their safety, as some have been “terrorized by people who have been emboldened by [Trump’s] intolerance.”</p>\n<p>“The best way to deal with this would be to educate people,” Jackson said. “I don’t think that people are inherently unkind to each other. We need to teach and talk with each other and recognize the importance of kindness and compassion.”</p>\n<p>According to Whittlesey, the state Senate’s work to limit the power of the executive order in California, along with Carbajal’s support in Congress, foreshadows how California will respond in the future to contentious presidential orders.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re going to see California reacting to a lot of Trump’s policies going forward,” Whittlesey said. “We’re definitely going to be a face of resistance during the administration.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, February 2, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-02-02/congressman-carbajal-resists-executive-ban/","id":3916,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3915,3914,3913],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":3,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/84"}},"__N_SSG":true}
