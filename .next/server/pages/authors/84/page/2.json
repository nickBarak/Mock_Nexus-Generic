We have to celebrate like we own the place — because we do.”</p>\n<p>“We are many, and they are few,” added Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval, professor of Chican@ studies.</p>\n<p>Eric Smith, professor of political science, told the <em>Nexus</em> on Tuesday that the national pushback and activism in response to the Trump administration is similar to the state of the nation in the 1960s during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>He explained that the U.S. must have a two-party political system in order to maintain balance. He said, however, the polarization between liberal and conservative Americans grew stronger during the presidential election campaign.</p>\n<p>Smith noted the way the UCSB campus has experienced its own polarization in the past few years and encouraged the university to host more events that bridge the divide between liberal and conservative students.</p>\n<p>Smith added, however, that there has been destructive actions on both sides. College Republicans’ signs announcing Ben Shapiro were vandalized with spray paint in February.</p>\n<p>“The majority of the campus is liberal on social issues,” Smith said. “Conservatives are feeling attacked and because of that, they’re afraid to speak out in public.”</p>\n<p>In April 2016, controversial pro-Trump graffiti was written in chalk on the ground near the North Hall mural and South Hall, which holds the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies.</p>\n<p>“If they felt more comfortable speaking up, there would be less of [those] personal attacks,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>Klawunn told the <em>Nexus</em> on Wednesday that since the election, the university has mobilized efforts to create more spaces for students to discuss controversial issues.</p>\n<p>The UCSB chapter of Young Americans for Liberty began hosting events in the Hub in the UCen to open the dialogue on campus about oftentimes controversial topics. In October, the group organized a debate on free speech in relation to extremist groups.</p>\n<p>The group also organized a discussion on the ethics of abortion on Wednesday, Nov. 8.</p>\n<p>Klawunn said the university plans to hold another forum about free speech during Winter Quarter to encourage students on both sides of the issue to voice their opinions.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to continue to have different opportunities,” Klawunn said. “Each opportunity can’t do everything but we hope we’ll offer a lot of different perspectives.”</p>\n<p>Vilna Bashi Treitler, professor and chair of the black studies department, said at the forum that she feels “optimistic” about the future because she has seen the way Americans have mobilized in response to the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“Oppression and dominance have been with us and may always be with us,” Treitler said. “We get knocked down but we can get back up again.”</p>\n<p>After the forum, the event moved to Storke Plaza, where attendees held blue LED lights and listened to the Chumash Inter-tribal Singers perform songs of survival and resilience.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on

(S.A.N.) at the beginning of Fall Quarter 2016. At the time, he was prepared to organize social justice movements under a Clinton presidency.</p>\n<p>When Donald Trump won the election, Villalobos had to change his plans.</p>\n<p>“I threw myself more into S.A.N. It’s like a full time job for me,” Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>The Student Activist Network is a student-run social justice organization that organizes demonstrations and protests for racial justice, gender equality, immigration, workers’ rights and other issues</p>\n<p>Since Election Day 2016, the network has organized and participated in several on-campus and local demonstrations, including protests after election day, a May Day rally for laborer rights, a rally against rape culture and a sit-in at Cheadle Hall with Fossil Free UCSB.</p>\n<p>Mayela Morales, a fourth-year Chican@ studies and global studies double major, is the head organizer of S.A.N. She became involved in student activism when she started taking Chican@ studies courses at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The biggest change Morales has witnessed in the U.S. since Trump became president is an increase in outward racism throughout the nation.</p>\n<p>She said Trump’s policies, like the administration’s travel ban in March and the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September, have spurred racist rhetoric and sentiments.</p>\n<p>“It always comes back to targeting a community in particular,” she said. “Racism has become more blunt — it’s just straight up in your face.”</p>\n<p>“There’s a more organized racism and misogyny,” Villalobos said, agreeing with Morales. “It’s here, it’s present and we’ll organize against it.”</p>\n<p>Racial justice is one of the Student Activist Network’s seven key issues, Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>The group has an organized a caucus for each of the seven issues: racial justice, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration, the environment, workers’ rights and student movements.</p>\n<p>Morales said many of the caucuses have organized projects in direct relation to the Trump administration’s policies, including Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’s repeal of Obama-era Title IX policies.</p>\n<p>The feminist caucus, for example, is collaborating with Ro Earvin, a UCSB student who presented a list of demands to Chancellor Henry T. Yang in May to reform how the university handles sexual violence.</p>\n<p>S.A.N. is also working to create anti-war and anti-police caucuses, Villalobos said.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the Student Activist Network printed 500 copies of its “Disorientation Guide,” a booklet that contains historical information about student movements and activism at UCSB, as well as information on labor unions and housing cooperatives.</p>\n<p>“When you come to the university, you get an orientation packet,” Villalobos said. “This is the same thing except it’s from a radical perspective. This shows students [UCSB] is not just a place where you go to class, get your degree and leave.”</p>\n<p>Villalobos said the “Disorientation Guide” will helps students understand the impact students have made on UCSB’s history and know how to better organize against oppression today.</p>\n<p>“When I started S.A.N., it was a piece of beat-up notebook paper,” Villalobos said, reflecting on how much the organization and its structure have changed in the past year.</p>\n<p>Today, the group has a head organizer, an internal organizer, treasurer, a meeting facilitator and a central organizing committee.</p>\n<p>The network also holds core organizing meetings, during which the board discusses long term plans, and general body meetings, in which all caucuses meet together to work on their projects.</p>\n<p>The Student Activist Network is open to anyone interested in joining<strong>, </strong>Villalobos said, which is an aspect of the organization he believes makes it unique on campus.</p>\n<p>“We’re a radical student group, but we accept everyone,” he said, adding that without limits based on political affiliation or identity, the network is able to address a variety of social issues that affect different groups.</p>\n<p>Villalobos also said the Student Activist Network wants to educate more incoming students about the history of movement-based activism and getting involved.</p>\n<p>“The university is a site of struggle, and historically there’s been a lot of action,” he said.</p>\n<p>Villalobos, who will graduate at the end of Fall Quarter, said he wants to keep students engaged with movement-based politics even after the Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>While the Trump administration has inspired more people to become activists, Villalobos said, movements against racism, transphobia, misogyny and gender inequality have always existed.</p>\n<p>“There’s the resistance to all these things that have existed before [Trump] and will exist afterwards,” he added. “They have to be resisted either way.”</p>\n<p>As the Student Activist Network looks toward the future, Villalobos said it is important for students to remain resilient and dedicated to social justice even after Trump leaves office.</p>\n<p>“The message has been like the Democrats aren’t going to save you, the elections aren’t going to save you necessarily,” he said. “We have to save ourselves.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 9 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

Through the mutual assistance program, officers from other University of California campuses, including San Diego, Riverside, Irvine and San Francisco, provided police services at UCSB.</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), a division of the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s office (SBSO), had about 40 deputies in  I.V. on Friday, 38 on Saturday, 9 on Sunday and 10 on Monday, according to Lt. Ruben Cintron.</p>\n<p>Cintron said IVFP expects to decrease the number of officers in I.V. in upcoming years, but it will depend on weekend activity leading up to the holiday.</p>\n<p>“We hope that we can bring it down further than that, but hope is not a plan,” Cintron said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79466\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/officerstats.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"724239385\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"79465\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79466\" data-attachment-id=\"79466\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-31/halloween-weekend-2017-uneventful-in-isla-vista-law-enforcement-drops/officerstats/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/officerstats.jpg?fit=1224%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1224,576\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"officerstats\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/officerstats.jpg?fit=250%2C118&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/officerstats.jpg?fit=888%2C418&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-79466 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/officerstats-1024x482.jpg?resize=888%2C418\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/officerstats.jpg?resize=1024%2C482&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/officerstats.jpg?resize=250%2C118&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/officerstats.jpg?resize=768%2C361&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/officerstats.jpg?w=1224&amp;ssl=1 1224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-79466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>IVFP also set up barricades on Friday on streets in I.V. but took them down the same day due to inactivity, Cintron said.</p>\n<p>UCPD had about 65 officers patrolling I.V. on Friday and Saturday and IVFP had about 100 officers patrolling on Friday and Saturday in 2016, the <i>Nexus</i> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-10-13/law-enforcement-down-30-percent-for-halloween/\">reported</a> last year.</p>\n<p>Kelly Hoover, SBSO spokesperson, said the weekend also saw less criminal activity in I.V. and on campus.

The <em>Nexus</em> <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-02-09/ucsb-will-spend-up-to-40k-on-ads-discouraging-deltopia-crowds/\">reported</a> in February that the university spent $30,000 on advertisements for Halloween weekend last year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advertisements are one of the ways the university has tried to curb attendance during party weekends like Halloween and Deltopia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estrada said the campus-wide efforts build on the student-based “keep it local” initiative, a campaign that runs television and radio advertisements throughout the year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs sends letters to college students throughout California that outline regulations that could impact students if they choose to attend Halloween in I.V. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university also sends letters to local junior high and high schools urging students to not celebrate Halloween in I.V.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katya Armistead, dean of student life, said the Office of Student Life met with representatives from Associated Students and UC Isla Vista in the beginning of Fall Quarter to share the content of the advertisements and receive feedback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batsheva Stoll, external vice president of local affairs, said she appreciates the university’s efforts to decrease attendance in I.V. during Halloween weekend but said the advertisements are an expensive option and can provoke misunderstanding.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The ads themselves can give I.V. a bad rap by making it seem like a scary hostile place when it’s our home and our community,” Stoll said in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office (SBSO), the turnout for Halloween weekend has steadily decreased over the past three years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBSO estimated that “several hundred” people were in I.V. for Halloween weekend last year, Hoover said, a significant decrease from the 13,000 partygoers that visited I.V. in 2013. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) will have about 55 officers patrolling I.V. this weekend, said Sgt. Rob Romero, UCPD spokesperson. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UCPD will also source officers from four other University of California campuses to assist in patrolling, including officers from San Diego, Riverside, Irvine and San Francisco. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoover said there will still be a strong law enforcement presence in I.V. this weekend, despite the decreased turnout in recent years. The SBSO does not release the number of officers assigned to an operation for safety reasons, Hoover said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We’ve been really pleased with what we’ve seen in the last couple of years, with students really having pride in their community and their school and wanting to keep Isla Vista safe,” Hoover said.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79352\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79352\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-28/advertisements-cost-uc-santa-barbara-up-to-30k-for-halloween-weekend/","id":2350,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2349,2348,2347],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Tattoo Parlor’s Precious Dogs Leave Their Prints on Isla Vista Community","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2017-10-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Puppers-by-Anthony-Lai-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Puppers-by-Anthony-Lai-ONLINE-1.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Precious Slut Tattoo, a local piercing and tattoo parlor, has long grabbed the community’s attention with its risqué name.

Anthony<em> Lai / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Precious Slut Tattoo, a local piercing and tattoo parlor, has long grabbed the community’s attention with its risqué name. Now, students have five more reasons to flock to the shop.</p>\n<p>Stormy, Jacob, Tucker, Buster Brown and Maisy have become an integral part of the Isla Vista community through their eagerness and friendly nature.</p>\n<p>Tracy Holt, who opened Precious Slut Tattoo 12 years ago, said his dogs are a form of support for Isla Vistans and visitors on both good and bad days.</p>\n<p>“Whether it’s finals, boyfriends, girlfriends just broke up with you, parents kicking them out of school, wrecked the car, DUI,” Holt said. “Everyone in Isla Vista seems to know those dogs; a lot of people know them by name.”</p>\n<p>Holt said he has owned dogs for his whole life and once owned 11 dogs at the same time. He said the “unmeasured” companionship is unlike any other.</p>\n<p>“There’s just no greater form of friendship,” Holt said. “It’s unsolicited.”</p>\n<p>While all of the dogs have been raised under the same roof, they’ve each developed distinct personalities.</p>\n<p>Stormy, one of the American Pit Bull Terriers, is seven years old and has established herself as the alpha dog of the pack. She is strong and protective but loving, and she insists on sitting at the kitchen table for dinner each night.</p>\n<p>Jacob, the six-year-old “chicken” and second pit bull, gets creative when it comes to stealing more time with Holt.</p>\n<p>“Jake sits on my shoes in the morning ’cause he knows I need them to leave,” Holt laughed.</p>\n<p>Holt said he is not supposed to have a favorite, but has a special attachment to Tucker, a two-year-old French Bulldog. The codependent Tucker follows Holt around everywhere he goes.</p>\n<p>Maisy is a one-and-a-half-year-old French Bulldog who enjoys fighting sprinklers in her free time.</p>\n<p>Buster Brown, the 10-month-old French Bulldog and baby of the group, is always ready for a chase, even if it means running into the street during a <em>Nexus</em> interview.</p>\n<p>Despite their varying ages and unique traits, Holt said all the dogs are protective and ready to defend anyone in need, even against Holt himself.</p>\n<p>“I’ve raised those dogs to protect anyone,” Holt said proudly, comparing it to raising children.</p>\n<p>“If you raise that animal to be shitty to other people … then I don’t feel that that dog is going to defend you,” he said. “You’ve allowed that to happen.”</p>\n<p>Owners should be especially mindful in raising muscular dogs like pit bulls because they have a greater potential for defense than smaller dogs, Holt said.</p>\n<p>“The only problem with the scenario of a pit bull is he’s genetically built and designed to be that star kind of athlete,” he said. “He just … is more capable of defending.”</p>\n<p>Several years ago, Holt’s dog of 14 years died. He didn’t know if he would get another.</p>\n<p>“There was such a vacancy in my life, a lack of protection, a lack of ability to hear what was going on outside my house,” he said. “I never noticed that void in my whole life … and then I just realized how vulnerable I felt without it.”</p>\n<p>Holt had trouble putting into words the positive impact that his pups have had on his life.</p>\n<p>“The thing that I feel like so many people are looking for in the world and don’t know where to find it … I feel like I’ve done all of that in this little mini group of mine,” he said.</p>\n<p>Holt owns two other Precious Slut Tattoo shops in Nevada in addition to the Isla Vista location.</p>\n<p>One of the shops is located in Las Vegas, where 58 people died in a mass shooting on Oct. 1, 2017.</p>\n<p>Holt, recalling the devastation in Isla Vista after the events of May 23, 2014, said the dogs have acted as a source of comfort for both communities in mourning.</p>\n<p>“If I could only say anything, it’s how at the end of the day no matter how shitty life is, no matter how bad this big mass shooting thing in Vegas… People come here and they pet these dogs, and you see it make a difference in people’s lives,” Holt said.</p>\n<p>Stormy, Jacob, Tucker,  Buster Brown and Maisy have been around to see several UCSB graduating classes come and go, and alumni remember them when they come back to visit.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 12, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus<em>.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79092\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/79092/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79092\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/79092/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/79092/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/79092/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-12/79092/","id":3427,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3426,3425,3424],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"DACA Recipient: Repeal Is ‘Wake-Up Call,’ Urges Action","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mastres_StorkePanorama.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Mastres_StorkePanorama.jpg?resize=471%2C289&ssl=1","description":"Mariel Islas moved to the United States when she was five years old and joined the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program at the age of 16.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mariel Islas moved to the United States when she was five years old and joined the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program at the age of 16.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, Oct. 5, Islas and approximately </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">154,000 DACA recipients in the U.S. will face the last day to renew their eligibility.

The administration may not announce an extended deadline for the undocumented youth whose applications expire after that date.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas’s application expires after the March deadline and she said she may not renew her application if an additional renewal date is scheduled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I don’t favor DACA,” she said. “It’s this whole complacency that’s taken part within the community. We just forget about other people’s struggles and other people’s narratives.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former President Barack Obama signed DACA into law with an executive order in 2012. Since the program’s introduction, the UC has admitted thousands of recipients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 800,000 young people in the United States are DACA recipients and approximately 4,000 undocumented students attend a UC campus, according to the UC Office of the President.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas said she understood the benefits of DACA when she began school at UC Santa Barbara and was hired for an on-campus job. She said, however, that she still lives in “a constant state of fear” because DACA does not protect all members of her family, including her mother.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Coming from someone who has an undocumented mother, I worry more about her than I worried about myself,” Islas said. “DACA never protected my mom and that was my biggest concern.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution Tuesday in support of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DACA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supervisors Janet Wolf, Joan Hartmann and Das Williams were the resolution’s staunchest supporters; supervisors Steve Lavagnino and Peter Adam, however, abstained from voting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third District Supervisor Hartmann said while the resolution was primarily a symbolic gesture, she believes symbols are “vitally important” for local communities to impact the federal government’s policies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“To me, the resolution was a statement that the County values our Dreamers and we have a welcome sign at the door,” Hartmann said in an email. “They should know that we want to invest in their futures because they are critical to the County’s future.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UC President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security on Sept. 8 in response to President Trump’s repeal of DACA. Napolitano alleged that the “unlawful” repeal violated the rights of the people that benefit from the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UC also allocates $2.5 million per year for undocumented student fellowships under Napolitano’s D.R.E.A.M. loan initiative, and grants the UC’s Undocumented Legal Services Center $900,000 per year under the Undocumented Student Services Program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States Supreme Court recently turned down a case challenging the UC Regents’ decision to allow undocumented students access to financial aid and pay in-state tuition fees in California.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Trump has given the DACA repeal to Congress, which can suggest a replacement for DACA in six months before the president officially abolishes the program.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Islas said while she does not trust Congress, the best form of a new system for the undocumented community would include an updated D.R.E.A.M.

According to the $48 Fix report, tuition could be free for university and college students in California with the implementation of a statewide income surtax of $48 per year for the median California taxpayer.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While the Senate’s approval of the resolution is primarily symbolic, it will prompt action from the executive branches of A.S. to hold campus-based campaigns, UC Student Association and U.S. Student Association meetings, as well as lobby visits with state representatives to gain support for the plan throughout the state.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I would like to see people direct their energy and anger to their local legislators,” Woodrow Davidson, EVPSA deputy chief of staff and one of the resolution’s student sponsors, said. “That’s where people need to begin ramping up the pressure. In the end, it has to pass through the state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The resolution was the first item on the agenda at the senate’s first meeting of the year and was authored by senators Dhishal Jayasinghe and Andrea Reyes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Tuition [that is] free is not a ridiculous idea,” Reyes told the <i>Nexus </i>on<i> </i>Tuesday. “It’s something that is possible in our state.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Reyes is a transfer student and said the cost of a public university was the primary reason she chose to attend a community college before coming to UC Santa Barbara. She said, however, that she believes even the cost of community college can be a financial burden for many students.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Spencer Brandt, one of the resolution’s student sponsors, said in a changing world and economy, the state must invest in higher education and not only fund K-12 education.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s important to have [senate’s] support to continue the movement for free college in California and gather momentum at the grassroots level,” Brandt said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Davidson told the <i>Nexus</i> on Tuesday he planned to attend a community college after high school because of its affordability, but his father encouraged him to attend UC Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He reminded the senate at the meeting that a UC, California State University and community college education was originally free. He said he believes the current political climate of instability presents students with an opportunity to make important changes at the higher levels of government.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is the moment that we seize on,” Davidson said. “This is the moment that we can truly make a better future for not just ourselves but for the people who will be coming here years down the road.”</p>\n<p><em>Anjalie Tandon contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the October 5, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

Residence Halls, are exclusively for UCSB-owned vehicles.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The university currently has 28 charging stations for faculty, student and visitor use in parking lots 10, 18, 22 and 60. In addition to the electric chargers, there are 34 stations on campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Each two-space charging station costs approximately $10,000, according to James Wagner, program manager for transportation and parking services. The university pays an additional $250 per year for each space in network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The university may also install charging stations in parking lot 31 at the end of the calendar year after assessing the total costs of the project.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Many university staff and faculty members charge their vehicle while at work if they do not have an electric car charger at home.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Rates for the charging stations vary depending on their location and power level. Level one is the most basic power level and level two is six times as powerful as the first level, Wagner said.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Level one power is $1 for every four hours, with a 12-hour maximum. Level two power costs $1 per hour with a 10-hour maximum in most parking structures. Level two power in Lot 60 costs $0.20 per kilowatt hour.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the university primarily relies on grants to fund the charging stations.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Organizations such as the California Department of Energy, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District and the Green Initiatives Fund of UCSB provide the funding.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The vehicle charging stations are not a source of revenue for the university, Wagner said, adding that the fee users pay to charge their vehicles is distributed to the stations’ maintenance, payment processing fees and the network connection fees.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">UCSB housing and dining services installed the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in Lots 58, 59 and 60.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Wagner said the charging station installation process does not take longer than a week, especially if the underground wiring is already in place.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">According to data collected by the university’s transportation and parking services department, the use of electric energy has steadily increased since they were first installed in 2012. This year, approximately 125 megawatts hours (MWh) were distributed by the electric vehicle charging stations.</p>\n<p>According to the California New Car Dealers Association’s quarterly report released in May 2017, 4.8 percent of new vehicles registered in California in the first three months of 2017 were zero-emission vehicles and plug-in hybrids.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Correction: </span><span class=\"s1\">The university pays $250 per year in network connection fees, not electric connection fees, as the article previously stated. The article was also corrected to clarify that energy is measured in megawatt hours, not megawatts per hour. </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\"> </span></em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79005\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79005\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-10-05/ucsb-gets-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bringing-total-to-34/","id":2365,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2364,2363,2362],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"G.O.L.D.

Right now, it’s kind of its own thing,” said Anthony Schmid, the Associate Registrar for Information Systems.</p>\n<p>Schmid said the Registrar has been working on the updates for approximately one year. The mobile version of the website will be completed by the end of the calendar year, as the Registrar has decided on the appearance of the website and is waiting for developers to edit and test the site.</p>\n<p>Schmid said the changes will make G.O.L.D. “more manageable” for students to access the website on their phone. He said approximately 44 percent of the 4,864,849 times G.O.L.D. has been accessed in the past year has been through mobile phones.</p>\n<p>“Whenever I try to access G.O.L.D. on my phone to check things, it’s a bit of a pain to navigate and have to pinch and zoom to see anything,” Schmid said.</p>\n<p>The Registrar is also making adjustments to the “Graduation” page on G.O.L.D. to be more straightforward and is redesigning the “Advanced Course Search” function, Schmid said. There is not a set date for the completion of these projects.</p>\n<p>University Registrar Leesa Beck also said the Registrar is interested in making it easier to find and use degree audits to help more students understand their academic progress and graduate on time</p>\n<p>Schmid said, however, that the university is focused on updating the “look and feel” of the website before altering its functionality.</p>\n<p>Student Information Systems and Technology provides support for the Registrar’s websites and estimates the total project will cost between $15,000 and $20,000, depending on the amount of additional work needed based on the site testing.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, students have created their own extensions to the G.O.L.D. website unaffiliated with the university. An application called GauchoMap launched on Oct. 2016 on Google Chrome that allows students to locate their classes on G.O.L.D. in an interactive map.</p>\n<p>Students have shared information about the application on Facebook groups such as Free &amp; For Sale, a page on which students can buy and sell items like clothes and furniture. According to the Google Chrome web store, the application currently has 274 users.</p>\n<p>Schmid said students also added a Rate My Professor extension to the website, which lasted for approximately two years. He said the university is not concerned with the student-created extensions unless the extensions use the UCSB name and seal.</p>\n<p>Schmid said while the Registrar has not received any vocal complaints about the G.O.L.D. website, the Registrar wanted to upgrade the appearance of the site to keep it up-to-date with modern standards.</p>\n<p>“We figured it was time to move into the 20-teens [of technology],” Schmid said.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 28, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div

id=\"caption-attachment-78887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Campbell Nolan / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Today, at 82 years old, Kirtman says he never guessed he would be the longest active teaching professor at UCSB.</p>\n<p>With vast knowledge of chemistry and university history as well as a witty sense of humor, Kirtman is the kind of professor who prompts the image of a long conversation over a cup of tea.</p>\n<p>He instantly make guests feel welcome in his paper-cluttered office on the fourth floor of the chemistry building.</p>\n<p>Kirtman is a professor in the chemistry department and specializes in the quantum theory of electronic structure, which requires predicting the properties of all chemical systems based on the electronic motions in their atomic systems.</p>\n<p>Born on March 30, 1935, and originally from New York, Kirtman went to Columbia University for undergraduate studies and received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Harvard University in 1961.</p>\n<p>The year 1965 was an exciting time for UCSB because the campus was expanding geographically and academically, Kirtman said.</p>\n<p>“The campus had decided to grow and I think that’s part of why I came here,” Kirtman said. “It was going to grow into a major research university.”</p>\n<p>“I get lost walking on the campus myself,” he joked, adding that the many construction projects over the years have transformed the university. The chemistry building where his office is located was not yet constructed when Kirtman began teaching in 1965.</p>\n<p>As Kirtman reflected on his most memorable moments at UCSB, he recalled the Vietnam War as a critical turning point in politics on campus and in the university’s academic curriculum.</p>\n<p>Kirtman said during the war he was responsible for managing a crisis courses program, in which professors could alter their class syllabi to include information about the operation in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>“Professors could either participate in that program and change the orientation of their course for a quarter to meet what was going on in Vietnam, or continue the way they were going,” Kirtman explained.</p>\n<p>While Kirtman did not reorganize his own classes on quantum theory to address the Vietnam War, he created a course for all students on the social responsibility of scientists in response to the war.</p>\n<p>“At the very beginning of the course, I had to reorient the class to develop the scientific way of thinking about things,” he said, noting that scientists and humanists differ in the way they reach conclusions and answers to problems.</p>\n<p>In bridging scientific thinking and social issues, Kirtman connected the way science was becoming increasingly political and addressed how scientists should be vocal in scientific political dialogue.</p>\n<p>Kirtman said his own son researches climate science at the University of Miami in Florida and said he hopes his son becomes involved in the political debate surrounding climate change.</p>\n<p>“I often say, ‘The lawyers think they can abolish the law of thermodynamics, which is a scientific law you can’t abolish,’ ” he said with a chuckle. “Science is made political by politicians and it is a very important issue right now.”</p>\n<p>Kirtman said he is most proud of his work with students who have gone on to careers in chemistry as well as his own research conducted in quantum theory.</p>\n<p>“There’s been a lot of individual research moments when the light bulb went on,” he said.</p>\n<p>He is especially proud of the “revolutionary” work he did with quantum theory as applied to electric fields interacting with crystalline materials. This work was featured in a symposium in Rhodes, Greece, in 2009.</p>\n<p>While Kirtman said he certainly has favorite students, he said he believes any student can be successful if they are willing to work diligently.</p>\n<p>He also served as the chair of the chemistry department from 1985 to 1994 and is the former chair of the Academic Senate. He was also one of the first professors to teach students in the College of Creative Studies when it formed in 1967.</p>\n<p>A love of UCSB runs in the family, as Kirtman’s wife also worked for the university as the director of publications for the <em>Nexus</em>. The couple will celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary in December.</p>\n<p>While his two children live on the East Coast, Kirtman said he loves the UC and California and does not have plans to leave anytime soon.</p>\n<p>“You don’t leave unless there’s good reason to leave,” he said. “Santa Barbara is a great place to live and work with very good faculty and students. So, why leave?”</p>\n<p>Kirtman dedicated his life to academics and said working and being a part of a university has been extremely rewarding. As the school year begins, Kirtman advises all students to take advantage of UCSB’s unique classes and academic opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Have fun. It’s a great time of life and you have no responsibilities,” Kirtman said enthusiastically, with perhaps a touch of nostalgia in his eyes. “Take everything that’s offered and pursue all your interests.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 28, 2017, edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

August 2016 after the university opened a Title IX investigation against him. The university opened the investigation after it discovered a 19-second video in which Doe and his ex-girlfriend argued on camera before the screen went black.</p>\n<p>University officials said the video “amply justified” Doe’s suspension while the university conducted a Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>Doe filed a complaint against the university in December 2016 to remove the interim suspension and <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2017-04-06/embattled-students-suspension-lifted/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">returned to school in April</a> 2017.</p>\n<p>Judge Thomas Anderle of the Santa Barbara Superior Court ruled against the imposed suspension in the March court order, citing the university’s concealment of evidence as a cause and calling the university “seriously prejudiced” in its actions.</p>\n<p>“This court disagrees with UCSB’s claim that the University’s use of the detective’s summaries in issuing the interim suspension does not violate his due process rights,” Anderle said in the court ruling. “John Doe is entitled to know all the information against him at the hearing, not via emailing his counsel allegedly critical and decisive information at a later time.”</p>\n<p>Bob Ottilie, Doe’s lawyer, submitted an amended complaint to Anderle in July alleging that the university concealed evidence from Doe and violated his right to due process.</p>\n<p>According to the court order and complaint, former director of judicial affairs Sandra Vasquez withheld two police emails from Doe during a hearing with him on Sept., 22, 2016 that the university used in the investigation. One email included statements by third parties attributed to Doe’s ex-girlfriend, Jane Doe.</p>\n<p>Anderle found that the university never contacted Jane Doe to corroborate the statements.</p>\n<p>After the hearing, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn made the decision to continue Doe’s suspension until the conclusion of the Title IX investigation.</p>\n<p>The court received the evidence in March days before a court hearing on March 21. At the hearing, Klawunn said under oath she had considered the two pieces of concealed evidence in making her decision.</p>\n<p>The university declined to comment on the case.</p>\n<p>Vasquez has since left her position at UCSB and is now the dean of students at Pitzer College. Vasquez could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>In an email to the Pitzer student body in August in response to allegations of concealing evidence from Doe, however, Vasquez said she has “never concealed material evidence in any case.”</p>\n<p>Anderle also said in the court ruling that the university took too long to investigate, the<em> Nexus</em> reported in April, failing to conclude the Title IX investigation within the 60 calendar day deadline federally required for Title IX investigations and the 60 business day deadline required by the university.</p>\n<p>The Title IX investigation is still ongoing, and the university has not placed charges on the student or interviewed any key witnesses.<br>\nThe judge also ruled that the university caused Doe “irreparable harm” in barring him from the majority of his first year at UCSB.</p>\n<p>Ottilie said he is “confident” Doe’s record will ultimately be cleared due to the evidence in support of the student and Judge Anderle’s ruling in March.</p>\n<p>“If charged and convicted, we are just going to go back to court with the same record and the same judge and ask the judge to throw it out — which we’re confident he would,” Ottilie said.</p>\n<p>In a letter from Ottilie to the UC Regents and the Office of the Chancellor at UCSB, Ottilie expressed concern that the university mistreated Doe through the suspension because he is a minority student and unable to legally contest due to lack of financial resources.</p>\n<p>According to the March court ruling, Doe has incurred more than $100,000 in attorney’s fees since his filing in December. Ottilie said in an interview with the <em>Nexus</em> on Monday that Doe is currently unable to pay the expenses.</p>\n<p>The United States Department of Education accepted the case for further investigation of potential Title IX and VI policy violations.</p>\n<p>According to the Department of Education’s website, Title IX “prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex” and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page one of the September 21, 2017, print edition

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The California Highway Patrol will begin enforcing the new traffic light law immediately after installation, which is expected to be completed by Sept. 15. <em>Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The County Public Works Department estimates the project will take four to six weeks. The traffic signal at the intersection was first discussed in the mid-2000s as part of the Isla Vista Master Plan, a long-term infrastructure project for I.V.</p>\n<p>County Public Works director Scott McGolpin said Southern California Edison electric company will remove the existing eight streetlights at the intersection within the next week and the new traffic signal poles will replace the streetlight infrastructure.</p>\n<p>According to Lieutenant Steve Larson of the California Highway Patrol (CHP), the CHP will begin enforcing the new traffic light law immediately after installation.</p>\n<p>“People need to realize that once a light goes on, it is enforceable,” Larson said. “If the light is red, the light is red. The bicyclists, the skateboarders, they all have to stop at the stoplight.”</p>\n<p>According to the County Public Works Department, the project costs $300,000. The public works department will fund half the cost and UC Santa Barbara will provide funding for the other half.</p>\n<p>McGolpin described the installation as a “pretty easy job” because it will be completed on the sidewalks, allowing cars, bikers and pedestrians to still use the street during construction.</p>\n<p>The traffic signal will not have sensors but will operate on a timer of approximately 20 seconds. Pedestrians will be able to see how many seconds they have to cross the street to adjust their speed.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said 20 seconds is the approximate time it takes the slowest pedestrian to cross the street at the intersection.</p>\n<p>McGolpin also said the county plans to coordinate with local artists to paint the signal cabinets, similar to those on El Colegio. He said he hopes this will minimize the chance of graffiti on the cabinets.</p>\n<p>The project will be as noninvasive as possible, he said, because the department does not want to damage the construction completed on Pardall Road in 2009. The 2009 construction included the installation of the streetlights and palm trees, as well as pouring new concrete at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“We want to minimize the damage because we did the improvements along Pardall and it would be costly to remove all that,” McGolpin said.</p>\n<p>McGolpin said the county has discussed the project with the Isla Vista Community Network, local businesses, the Associated Students (A.S.) Senate and local residents. He said it also plans to work with law enforcement to ensure a smooth transition to the new traffic signal.</p>\n<p>The plan received criticism from students in February, when former A.S. Senator Alex Giolito created a petition in opposition to the traffic light installation. The petition called for the termination of the project and urged alternative methods of controlling the busy intersection.</p>\n<p>County officials addressed the alternatives, such as additional bike lanes in I.V. or channeling bike traffic more evenly to and from campus from I.V., but they ultimately deemed these solutions “too multilayered” to be practical.</p>\n<p>The county originally intended to install another traffic signal at the intersection between Pardall Road and Embarcadero Del Mar but decided a signal at one intersection would create a sufficient break in the bike traffic.</p>\n<p>The county also considered installing a roundabout or a four-way stop at the intersection but determined it would not be able to safely sustain the amount of people on bikes at the intersection.</p>\n<p>“It’s a cultural change, and we’re in the heart of the community,” McGolpin said. “We think this one signal should be enough, and we wanted to have a softer touch on the community since we’re doing a signal for the first time in I.V.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: This story previously said the stoplight was funded by a grant. The Santa Barbara County Public Works Department and UCSB provided funding. </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 1 of the Thursday, Aug. 24, 2017, print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-78731\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-78731\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-08-24/county-to-install-pardall-stoplight/","id":4385,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[4384,4383,4382],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Legacies Not Lost: Memorial Scholarships Carry on Dreams of I.V.

in Corwin Pavilion on May 10.</p>\n<p>The resolution, sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine members Anumita Kaur and Edan Tessema, called for the university to divest from companies such as Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Caterpillar and Hewlett-Packard, which allegedly perpetuate human rights abuses of the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p>A resolution to divest was first proposed at UCSB in 2013 and has now failed to pass four times.</p>\n<p>Eight other UC campus student governments have voted to divest, including Berkeley, San Diego, Riverside, Irvine, Merced, Los Angeles, Davis and Santa Cruz. No UC campus, however, has actually divested.</p>\n<p>The first divestment resolution was proposed at UC Berkeley in 2010, where it passed through the student government but was later vetoed by then-student president Will Smelko. The latest resolution passed in 2015.</p>\n<p>Some divestment resolutions, however, have faced further challenges. A UC Santa Cruz divestment resolution passed through its student government in May 2014 but was almost recalled in 2015 due to concerns about the original voting process.  At UC Davis, a resolution to divest passed in January 2015 but was recalled in February 2015 by the student court.</p>\n<p>The UC Board of Regents released its “Principles of Intolerance” last year, a statement condemning anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism on UC campuses. In 2010, the Regents’ chairman, vice chairman and UC president released a statement saying they will not divest until the U.S. government declares that the foreign nation is “committing acts of genocide.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was allegedly the last of the UCs to vote in 1978 to divest from companies with business ties in South Africa during apartheid. The UC Regents voted to divest from the corporations in 1986.</p>\n<p>Kaur, a fourth-year sociology major, said she sees similarities in the South African divestment history and the current debate with Israel and Palestine.</p>\n<p>“For the fourth time in a row … UCSB is on the wrong side of history,” Kaur said. “I think that consistently UCSB’s Associated Students is choosing to remain complacent and complicit in violence.”</p>\n<p>Rabbi Evan Goodman of the Santa Barbara Hillel said the Israel-Palestine conflict is a “complex situation” and said he commends the Senate for “not following the path” of other student senates to vote to divest.</p>\n<p>Goodman said, however, that the eight other UC student governments that voted to divest are not representative of the current student bodies of those campuses because students, interests and motivations have changed since they voted to divest.</p>\n<p>“It’s a misnomer to say that all are voting to divest,” Goodman said. “They have each voted at a moment in time to do this.”</p>\n<p>According to Hillel International, UCSB has a current Jewish population of 2,850 students or 14 percent. This number is higher than on any other UC campus.</p>\n<p>Goodman said the large Jewish community at UCSB is a bonded group, and he cited the “UCSB Jewish Student Organizations’ Unified Opposition to BDS” unity letter as a sign of the collective efforts and ideals of the Jewish student population.</p>\n<p>Eight Jewish student organizations signed and released the letter last week in response to the divestment resolution and the Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.</p>\n<p>“Judaism is much more than a religion; it is a people,” Goodman said. “Israel plays an important role in the sense of Jewish peoplehood.”</p>\n<p>Kaur said she believes the resolution did not pass because there is a “lack of diversity” on Senate that she claims is due to the one-party dominance in A.S. elections. She said this results in similar ideologies running across the whole Senate.</p>\n<p>“We consistently see just one party sweeping our election,” Kaur said. “You can’t have a real democracy when it’s always one party that has the monopoly.”</p>\n<p>Despite supporting opposite positions of the divestment debate, Kaur and Goodman both said they believe students need to fully educate themselves about the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>\n<p>“There is a genuine [and] deep lack of understanding of what this divestment resolution is really about,” she said.</p>\n<p>Goodman said he does not believe UCSB will ever vote to divest but said he dislikes the way two different sides have emerged surrounding the debate.</p>\n<p>“I hate the idea that there is a winner and a loser here,” Goodman said, adding that he believes UCSB’s student body is willing to engage in contentious dialogue instead of only “trying to pick a fight” with one another.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang did not comment on the university’s position on divestment but said it is the university’s “role and responsibility” to create a space where students can discuss controversial topics.</p>\n<p>“I so appreciate seeing our students engage in such a thoughtful and passionate discussion on this issue as well as others,” Yang said in a statement. “Listening to and learning from each other are among the great benefits of being part of a diverse campus community represented by a variety of perspectives.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 18, 2017, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-77952\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-77952\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-05-18/four-years-later-still-a-no-for-israel-divestment/","id":3587,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3586,3585,3584],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/84"}},"__N_SSG":true}
