This year, the organization is encouraging political and business global leaders to connect with scientists and brainstorm how to improve ocean health.</p>\n<p>The Marine Science Institute (MSI) was selected to provide a scientific component to the global dialogue about ocean health. The Benioff Ocean Initiative, a program within MSI, will work directly with the WEF to present an ocean health plan at the United Nations Ocean Conference in June.</p>\n<p>“With a campus surrounded by the ocean on three sides, the health of our marine environments is something that is very personal for UCSB,” Pierre Wiltzius, the Susan &amp; Bruce Worster dean of science and executive dean of the College of Letters and Science, said in an email.</p>\n<p>“We also have a reputation as one of the leading institutions for marine research, and we are very proud to continue to foster an interdisciplinary environment that encourages collaboration around vital issues like ocean health,” he said.</p>\n<p>Douglas McCauley, the director of the Benioff Ocean Initiative and an assistant professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, said the WEF is hoping to increase ocean research and health. He said UCSB will be their “guide from the science community.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not just about whales anymore,” McCauley said, emphasizing the ocean’s modern role in economic, social and political issues.</p>\n<p>Wiltzius emphasized the importance of a dialogue between scientists and global leaders to preserve the marine environments for the future and said he believes the MSI’s leading research will help the “crusade to save our oceans.”</p>\n<p>“I believe that this will elevate the conversation about ocean health to a global level, which is crucial, because oceans affect the entire planet on a global scale,” Wiltzius said in an email. “We need the support of world leaders as we translate our marine science research into action.”</p>\n<p>McCauley recently went to the WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where he presented marine life extinction rates and the importance of improving the state of the ocean. According to McCauley, the WEF was receptive to his information and he is “optimistic” about the ocean’s future.</p>\n<p>“It’s really exciting to see a room full of people that really care and want to learn,” he said. “I think in the science community, people have done a really good job translating what is happening in the oceans into currencies that help global leaders understand that it matters.”</p>\n<p>The ocean’s economic value is $24 trillion, making its wellbeing more than an environmental issue — it’s a global commodity. Additionally, overfishing is a crucial problem affecting the oceans and can have current and future impacts on nutrition and food insecurity, as well as increase international conflicts over fish.</p>\n<p>McCauley said the MSI and WEF will focus their efforts on decreasing overfishing, particularly in the harvesting of tuna fish, and present their plan to the United Nations Ocean Conference this summer.</p>\n<p>“Historically, we thought that oceans couldn’t be overfished … but we figured out we were wrong,” McCauley said. “About one-third of all our global fish docks are overfished.”</p>\n<p>The plan will include combining transparency with sustainability, as well as offering ways to make sustainability more affordable. Some retailers are unwilling to change their consumer habits toward an environmental approach because of the expense of sustainable fishing.</p>\n<p>However, McCauley said many retailers are already joining the environmental effort and he hopes more will join the dialogue by the June meeting in New York.</p>\n<p>The WEF and the United Nations Oceans Conference will be making large steps in their address of global environmental concerns. McCauley expressed worry about the Trump administration’s quiet stance on ocean health, but he said the MSI and WEF’s partnership will allow for global leaders and scientists to address the environment as something more than a national topic.</p>\n<p>“The nice thing about the ocean is that [it] is truly a global commodity, and the future can be decided as an international conversation,” McCauley said.</p>\n<p>McCauley said he is hopeful the MSI and WEF partnership will be able to begin dedicated work for global oceans and make a lasting difference for future generations.</p>\n<p>“We view it as a legacy thing. I have kids, and I have to learn how to pass the ocean in a slightly better state to [them],” he said. “In many ways, this is a great time because everyone in the international community is realizing we need to work together.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-75241\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-75241\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-26/msi-wef-address-ocean-health-at-sb/","id":2714,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2713,2712,2711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"CCS Vetting Committee In Search of Faculty Member as New Dean","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2017-01-19T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CCS-Dean.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CCS-Dean.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The College of Creative Studies (CCS) Vetting Committee is in the midst of searching for a new dean of the college, increasing transparency in the process by inviting students and faculty to participa...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_74917\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-74917\" data-attachment-id=\"74917\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-19/ccs-vetting-committee-in-search-of-faculty-member-as-new-dean/ccs-dean/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CCS-Dean.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1333\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"ccs-dean\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CCS-Dean.jpg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CCS-Dean.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-74917\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/CCS-Dean-1024x682.jpg?resize=888%2C591\" alt=\"After receiving around 80 applications, the College of Creative Studies (CCS) Vetting Committee has narrowed the application pool down to four applicants, two from the science departments and two from the humanities departments.

A dean will be selected by July of this year. <em>Nexus File Photo</em></p></div>\n<p>The College of Creative Studies (CCS) Vetting Committee is in the midst of searching for a new dean of the college, increasing transparency in the process by inviting students and faculty to participate in the vetting process.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang and Executive Vice Chancellor David Marshall created the committee in April 2016 and began their search for a new dean of the college during Fall Quarter. The committee has opened town hall meetings to the public during which the applicants are interviewed for the position.</p>\n<p>The committee will vet the candidates and compile their recommendations for the position to give to Chancellor Yang, who will then choose the new dean by July.</p>\n<p>The position is open to faculty from all departments on campus and initially received around 80 applications. The committee has narrowed the application pool down to four applicants, two from science departments and two from the humanities departments.</p>\n<p>Various constituencies on campus are meeting with the candidates as the committee holds interviews, encouraging participants to have a role in the process, said Omer Blaes, chair of the Vetting Committee and a professor in the physics department.</p>\n<p>“Everyone who has participated in one of these events is free to send us information about their reactions, and we take that information in a confidential fashion,” Blaes said. “The committee evaluates that when considering who we want to recommend to the Chancellor.”</p>\n<p>Blaes has chaired other search committees, including that for the dean of the College of Letters and Sciences, and said while campus-wide interviews were held, there were few people on campus aware of the proceedings. He said everyone in the college was invited because members of CCS wanted more transparency in the vetting and decision-making process.</p>\n<p>The committee also reached out to faculty members in the applicants’ departments to join the meetings and offer advice about the candidates.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Foltz, the interim dean of CSS, said she believes it is “crucial” for candidates to interact with students and faculty at the town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>“You want to have candidates meet with people, and in this position in particular, to meet especially with the students,” Foltz said in an email. “I think it’s wonderful that so many students can meet these candidates and offer feedback to the Search Advisory Committee.”</p>\n<p>Foltz said this type of transparency is common for a candidate search at the administrative level.</p>\n<p>Bruce Tiffney, the previous dean of the college, stepped down from his position in July, and Foltz stepped in to temporarily serve as the dean while the committee vets applicants for the position. Foltz said she is not applying to be the permanent dean.</p>\n<p>Applicants for the administrative position go through a vetting process and answer a series of questions relating to their interest in the dean position and their administrative and leadership experience.</p>\n<p>There are eight majors in CCS, and Blaes stressed the importance of a dean working cohesively with each of them, focusing on undergraduate students’ research and creative processes.</p>\n<p>“The key aspect about this particular dean is that this dean is undergraduate-focused,” Blaes said. “They need to enable bright undergraduates [in] … the creative fields they’re engaged in.”</p>\n<p>He added that the vetting process has allowed the involved faculty members from different departments to interact and discuss the future of the college.</p>\n<p>“It’s one of the rare occasions that I am talking to people from the humanities about what CCS could be and what the whole campus could be in terms of bridging these very different disciplines,” Blaes said.</p>\n<p>“[The college] is what it is now and it’s viewed as a success, but because it brings together people in these different disciplines it could even serve as a nexus for faculty on the campus.”</p>\n<p>After the new dean is chosen, the candidate’s department will need to appoint a new faculty member to the vacancy subsequently created, a process the CCS Vetting Committee will not be a part of.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the new dean will not be expected to teach since the CCS dean position is a full-time commitment.</p>\n<p>“I have great hopes for this position,” Blaes said. “Everyone says CCS is a jewel in the crown at UCSB, and I really believe that. And I hope that we get someone who can make that jewel even greater.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, Jan. 19, 2017 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div

work makes the UC work” and “Pay workers enough to live in Santa Barbara County.”</p>\n<p>Union members across the state surrounded medical centers at UCLA, UCSD and UCSF. UCLA skilled trade union members were on strike for five days in protest of their low wages, marching into Westwood on Tuesday and temporarily blocking traffic.</p>\n<p>A 2015 Economic Policy Institute survey reported 92 percent of California union workers struggle to provide for themselves or their families.</p>\n<p>The UC employees’ contract expired in November and representatives from each campus have been meeting with university administration to negotiate a new contract since April, but an agreement is yet to be reached.</p>\n<p>UC has proposed an 18 percent pay increase over the next six years, but union members are saying the increase is not substantial. Furthermore, a UC spokesperson said in October that the UC “heavily subsidizes the cost of healthcare for our workers,” with those in lower paid positions contributing “as little as $47 a month for health benefits for their entire family.” The UC additionally offers a pension program with guaranteed payments on retirement.</p>\n<p>Dissenters have called the strike unlawful, but Debbie Fingerle, chief steward of UCSB Teamsters, said the stalled contract negotiations have left employees working without a contract, so the no-strike clause does not apply.</p>\n<p>“They will not negotiate in good faith,” Jedediah Johnson, office manager of the Teamsters Local 186 of Ventura, said. “We need to be at the table … and we need to learn about the cost of living and how much it actually cost with food, families [and] regulations.”</p>\n<p>Food security is another concern of the union as they battle for higher wages. According to a 2016 survey done by Teamsters Local 2010 and Occidental College, 70 percent of clerical workers struggle to buy food and 45 percent are “food insecure” and often skip meals due to a lack of resources. The survey was sent to 13,661 UC employees, and their median wage was reported to be $22.65 per hour.</p>\n<p>Brian Harwell, union member and the undergraduate advisor for the Department of Theater and Dance, said he is concerned about employees who struggle to provide food for themselves and their families.</p>\n<p>“In a higher education environment that is expensive, where you have really high pay for certain people in the university, it just seems petty and brutal,” Harwell said.</p>\n<p>Harwell said clerical employees provide a “significant role” on UC campuses, and he wants the strike to encourage understanding of the work they provide for the university.</p>\n<p>“We’re classified as clerical, but there are certain people that run the department,” Harwell said. “We have our hands in all the nuts and bolts.”</p>\n<p>Union workers hope Tuesday’s demonstration will pressure the UC to reach a contract with the employees that fulfills their demands. According to Fingerle, the union members are close to the results they want and “just need to push a little bit further” for their wage increases.</p>\n<p>“[The university is] very slow in responding, which is part of the reason we’re striking,” Fingerle said. “On a whole, they do come back with something, but it’s just not enough, and they have what we need.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74798\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74798\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/uc-employees-protest-low-wages/","id":2442,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2441,2440,2439],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Position Vacancies the Focus of Wednesday’s Senate Meeting","category":"News","subcategory":"Student Gov","publish_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"A.S. Senate is aiming to create a more organized process for filling vacancies.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Associated Students (A.S.) Senate discussed the resignations and appointments of four members at Wednesday’s meeting and how the vacancies will call for the creation of a permanent system of reappointments.</p>\n<p>Last year’s Senate experienced numerous vacancies, but still does not have a clear system devised to replace the senators’ positions. The past unorganized process resulted in conflict as the inconsistency prolonged the senator appointments. Bryan Velasquez’s resignation reminds the association of the importance of a clear procedure when appointing new senators.</p>\n<p>Velasquez, a second-year music major, resigned from his position as an on-campus senator during the 10th week of Fall Quarter, and Senate now must fulfill the position. According to Velasquez, his resignation was prompted by “personal reasons,” and he enjoyed working with Senate.</p>\n<p>“A lot of things happened towards the end of the quarter, and I thought it was best to take some time to figure things out,” Velasquez said.</p>\n<p>He said he would consider running for Senate again in the future, but “[doesn’t] see that happening any time soon.”</p>\n<p>“I would definitely be interested [in joining Senate again],” he said. “They’re all amazing people, and we all work really well together.”</p>\n<p>Off-campus senator and third-year economics major Ashley Selki will organize an ad-hoc committee where current senators will create a process to appoint a new senator to fill Velasquez’s vacancy. The position will then be opened for students to run, and the Senate has five weeks to appoint a new senator.</p>\n<p>EVPLA and fourth-year history of public policy major Ashcon Minoiefar encouraged the senators to take their time devising a permanent system as he recalled the vacancies the Senate experienced during his own term last year.</p>\n<p>“I very much encourage you to take your time … make a system, make it good, make it work,” Minoiefar said. “It can affect the whole association.”</p>\n<p>Minoiefar warned the Senate against arguing with each other and beginning the appointment process before a proper system is created. He said this would lead to more problems during this appointment and in future cases.</p>\n<p>“Whether you think you’re right, you all need to talk about it in here,” he said. “If you’re not happy with the process before you start, it is going to get a lot worse.”</p>\n<p>The Senate also opened the first meeting of the quarter with the swearing in of second-year political science and communication double major Izabella Kipnis as a new off-campus senator. Kipnis had previously worked with the Senate in the Honoraria Committee, a position that will now be filled by third-year political science major Jordan Goulet.</p>\n<p>Kipnis is currently working on transitioning into the Senate and is beginning to focus on working with I.V. Tenants Union in regards to the rising amount of evictions in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>Letters and Science Senator Jasmine Sandhu, third-year biopsychology and sociology double major, was also appointed as the new vice chair of the Finance and Business Committee.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 4 of the Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74797\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74797\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-01-12/position-vacancies-the-focus-of-wednesdays-senate-meeting/","id":3966,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3965,3964,3963],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Umail Phishing Scam Compromises Student, Admin Security","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-07-31T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Oct_22_Library_TonyUng3.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Oct_22_Library_TonyUng3.jpg?resize=980%2C640&ssl=1","description":"UCSB cyber security officials talk safety after scammers sent suspicious emails to UCSB students and administration \"phishing\" for login info.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Alejandra Sanchez opened an email from UCSB last week, she noticed something wasn’t quite right.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It looked suspicious because it was a blank email with a small link on it from an unfamiliar name,” the fourth-year psychology major said in an email. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon seeing a surprising lack of contact information for the university, which is usually found on university notices, Sanchez deleted the email.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanchez, along with many UCSB students, received a fake email last week to her umail account from a source claiming to be from the university, warning that her email was restricted and required verification to be accessed. The students were urged to click on a provided link, which would send them to a website where they could type their username and password to retrieve their email account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers are reaching UCSB email accounts through “phishing,” a multi-billion-dollar underground illegal business in which scammers send forged emails to a pool of email users and wait for users to respond to the message. While Sanchez did not respond to the “phishing” bait, many students did, releasing their usernames and passwords and allowing their accounts to be used in other phishing attempts by scammers.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this month, a similar email was sent to UCSB staff, and 16 members released their login information to the dangerous site. These unsecure emails are not the first of their kind and pose a variety of threats to email users. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once scammers have a username and login, they could use it as a gateway to access other accounts or look into students’ academic and personal records.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Sam Horowitz, UCSB’s chief information security officer, phishing is “very common and fairly easy to do.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are bad guys in the world,” Horowitz said. “This is kind of the nature of what email and criminal … activity look like today.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing is common in many countries, including those formerly part of the Eastern Block and some unexpected countries such as Germany and the United States. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A lot of former Soviet countries are places we see hotbeds of activity,” said Joe McClain, the director of student systems I.T. infrastructure, security &amp; user support of UCSB’s Student Systems and Technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Of course, China is on the list; there’s a lot of stuff happening in China, but there’re also countries you would never expect that would show up on the radar.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said unsecure emails are becoming more “sophisticated” to look like emails sent from legitimate organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When spammers go phishing, they are throwing a lure out there to see how many people bite on it,” McClain said. The more refined the email, the more likely people will trust it and release personal information.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spammers are not only interested in accessing singular email addresses, but look for addresses that are trusted and widely used, like the umail server. The level of this spam only appears to be rising. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McClain said there are “hundreds of thousands” of spam emails sent to the university’s many departments daily. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s getting worse because it works … they can throw a message out there, and people click the link and give out their usernames and passwords,” McClain said. “If people didn’t do it, it wouldn’t be worthwhile.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The university is always making improvements to the security systems in each department, but McClain notes in some cases it is easier to secure administration and business department emails on campus than academic departments.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The faculty typically wants things to be wide open, they want to be able to whatever they want to do … and the faculty have tremendous weight on campus,” McClain said. “So there are only so many things we can do to provide controls on systems used on the academic research side.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horowitz sent an email to students Friday in response to the phishing attacks with suggestions about how to avoid getting trapped in a phishing attempt, such as being aware of who the email is coming from or what the email looks like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also advised students to be “skeptical” of messages that seem “too good to be true, the consequences [are] too dire [or there’s a] sense of urgency.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, Sanchez and many other students refrained from giving their login information to the unsecure email sent last week. Horowitz said he hopes that with increased education about the danger of these phishing emails, fewer students and faculty will even consider opening the illicit messages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is an important thing, [and] it needs to be dealt with,” he said. “This stuff happens, and you need to protect yourself.”</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72015\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72015\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-07-31/umail-phishing-scam-compromises-student-admin-security/","id":2472,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2471,2470,2469],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Allocates $3.3 Million to Increase Student Access to Food","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unspecified.jpeg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/unspecified.jpeg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Juli Nguyen, who will begin her fourth year in the fall, has struggled with food insecurity since her first year at UC Santa Barbara.

She said she often found it difficult to focus on her schoolwork when she was so hungry that she felt nauseous.</p>\n<p>“One of my main concerns was worrying about not being able to focus on studying for an exam because I was hungry,” Nguyen said in an email. “It’s quite difficult to make the best out of your education when you’re focused on how you’re going to get access to your next meal [or] cook for your next meal.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen’s story is similar to the realities of many other UC students who find it hard to eat healthy and consistently with a college budget and rigorous student lifestyle.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The only way to reduce stigma around hunger is to start with your own personal narrative.”</p>\n<p>— Juli Nguyen</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to a spring 2015 survey from the UC, which was taken by 8,932 of 66,000 UC students, 42 percent of UC students struggled with poor quality food and insufficient sustenance in the past year.</p>\n<p>In response to the survey results, President Janet Napolitano announced Monday that she will allocate $3.3 million of the UC funds to help students struggling with food insecurity on behalf of the university’s Global Food Initiative. Each campus will receive $151,000 of the allocated amount.</p>\n<p>Among the focuses of the Global Food Initiative’s plan, the UC mentions the expansion of campus’ food pantry storage and access, an increase of student registration in CalFresh, the state’s nutrition assistance program and improved financial communication about the cost of food and living for students.</p>\n<p>Paul Monge, a UC Berkeley law student, UCSB alumnus and Student Regent designate, will work with Napolitano on projects to increase food security and said it is important for universities to receive more funding from the state rather than relying primarily on student tuition.</p>\n<p>“The university system is increasingly reliant on tuition and fees as their main source of revenue as opposed to state revenue,” Monge said. “The burden of paying for the universities … is placed on students and how that is translating is increase in prevalence of food insecurity.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61697\"

funding support the food bank’s expansion, adding that the current lack of funding is “keeping us from providing more for students that need it the most.”</p>\n<p>The survey also showed that 57 percent of students who now go hungry did not experience food problems during childhood, making this an even more “serious issue,” according to Katie Maynard, the UCSB Sustainability Coordinator.</p>\n<p>“Students may require additional information about crisis resources, financial aid, and making healthy choices on a limited budget” as they handle food inaccessibility for the first time, Maynard said in an email.</p>\n<p>Many students do not feel comfortable seeking assistance on the issue, however, causing them to “struggle in privacy,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>“I think what many of us don’t realize is that hunger can happen to anyone at any single time,” she said in an email. “If you go into I.V., it’s packed with people eating delicious food at a bunch of restaurants, but we don’t account for the percentage of students who are currently at home and hungry.”</p>\n<p>Maynard said UCSB’s Food Security Task Force will manage the $151,000 allocated to UCSB and plan to prioritize more options for low-income students, including the Certified Farmers’ Market and associated Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life.”</p>\n<p>— Paul Monge</p></blockquote>\n<p>She also said the task force will hire eight students so they can analyze solutions offered at other campuses and expand existing programs.</p>\n<p>According to Monge, the cost of housing and food security is not typically associated with the affordability of college, which leads to a system wide lack of focus on students’ wellbeing.</p>\n<p>“The way that we talk about affordability is often limited to fees and tuition, but I think we need to think about affordability in all aspects of a students’ life,” Monge said. “We really need to reframe the narrative about what the university has responsibility over in terms of … students.”</p>\n<p>Despite being an upperclassman who uses the A.S. Food Bank, Nguyen finds herself struggling to make food a priority in her busy schedule. The news of the new UC initiative “excites” her and she hopes it will increase discussion about a battle that so many students fight each day.</p>\n<p>“The only way to reduce stigma around hunger is to start with your own personal narrative,” Nguyen said in an email. “I’m glad that [food insecurity] is getting the attention it needs and I hope this attention becomes more and more public as we progress.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The remaining 97 votes went toward other Democratic and third-party candidates.</p>\n<p>Nearly 90 percent of voters chose to support Democratic candidates at the polls. Abboud said Sanders’s strong lead was likely due to support from the Sanders campaign support throughout campus and I.V.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t just that people wanted to vote for Bernie, but Bernie helped get people politically aware,” Abboud said. “A lot of the people we talked to knew about the issues very early on, so it was a good year.”</p>\n<p>The voter turnout among UCSB students and I.V. residents is even more astonishing because the primary election was held on last week of the quarter, when most students were completing final exams.</p>\n<p>“The numbers … show the level of organization and volunteer efforts here for the primary were extremely higher than average,” Abboud said. “The whole campaign was centered around driving turnout, because the primary was during finals week.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also noted that UCSB and I.V. voters will be especially important to the general election in November because of specific ballot measures, such as a marijuana legalization bill and the vote for I.V. to become a Community Services District (CSD).</p>\n<p>“The Isla Vista Community Services District election is in November and that is the most direct thing anyone could ever vote on to make Isla Vista a better place,” Abboud said. “So we believe that the excitement and the promise of CSD plus the importance of all the other races of elected office and the wide array of propositions on the ballot will be driving factors for people to vote.”</p>\n<p>Voters in Santa Barbara also selected candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the state senate, assembly and the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. Final results will be determined after the general election on Nov. 8.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, June 23, edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>[Correction: A previous version of this story said Clinton had won the Democratic presidential nomination, she has not yet secured the nomination.]</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

By the end of the evening, the surfaces of the paper lanterns were covered with pictures, songs and simple words such as “I.V. Strong.”</p>\n<p>The memorial events were smaller this year than last, allowing students to address the anniversary and heal in personal ways.</p>\n<p>“I think people just want a space — a space to heal and space to just do whatever they want that is going to benefit them the best — rather than having an organized official event,” Madeline Berger, third-year art and theater double major and student leader for the “Blunite” memorial, said.</p>\n<p>She said the canvases celebrated the life of each student and allowed visitors to acknowledge loss, even if they did not personally know the victims.</p>\n<p>“I think having dedicated spaces like the canvases really do make it a little more connected to each individual that we lost, but … there is no reason you have to connect yourself to exactly one victim,” Berger said. “There [were] tons of people that got hurt, got injured, got shot but recovered … but it was still a part of our community and it still happened to them.”</p>\n<p>Berger described the media attention from last year’s memorial as “overwhelming” and said this year’s gathering was just as special. She believes future anniversaries will be more “private and personal” as the community learns to heal over the passing years.</p>\n<p>“I think that a lot of the feelings that I’ve been getting from people are just, ‘I need to be able to express it however I am going to express it,’” Berger said. “There doesn’t need to be something big or grand … it can be something as simple as making tea light bags.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-71341\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-71341\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-05-24/blunite-commemorates-second-anniversary-of-may-23-shooting/","id":4611,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[4610,4609,4608],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCen Dining To Begin Using Cage-Free Eggs Menu","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/factoryfarm_-sierra-deak.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/factoryfarm_-sierra-deak.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCen Dining catering services will begin a transition to cruelty-free animal products next week by introducing cage-free eggs into their new menu.

UCen Dining is initially offering the cage-free option at catered events and wants to eventually source all meat products from humanely treated farm animals.</p>\n<p>According to John Lazarus, assistant director of production and catering for UCen Dining, catering services will soon begin working with Mary’s Global Animal Partnership and conduct regular assessments of how source animals are cared.</p>\n<p>Mary’s is a free-range chicken farm that uses Controlled Atmosphere Stunning (CAS) euthanasia for a gentler slaughtering process. CAS slowly drains the oxygen from the birds’ confinement to make their death less stressful before the slaughtering operation.</p>\n<p>“It’s cage-free, but it’s a little bit more than cage-free,” Lazarus said. “There’s a bunch of different types of certifications … People go to inspect how the hens are being treated as they’re being raised.”</p>\n<p>The move away from factory farms will create higher costs for purchasing food, but Lazarus hopes to convince students and faculty that “it’s an investment worth making” that will lead to better living conditions for farm animals.</p>\n<p>“Catering has the ability to absorb prices a little better than the retail units, so we’re really sensitive to not raising prices on a bowl of soup at Coral Tree Café or a sandwich at the Arbor because we know that students are already stretching their money as far as they possibly can,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>According to Andrew deCoriolis, Farm Forward’s director of strategic programs and engagement, reducing portion sizes will lower the costs of higher quality food and the transition to a more sustainable, vegetarian meal plan can result in less expensive animal products while also ensuring animals lived a decent life before dying.</p>\n<p>The total cost comparison between factory farms and cage-free farms is unavailable at this time and will be released in the fall.</p>\n<p>Lazarus said that the project was inspired by a variety of concerns, including the environmental impact and health concerns that arise from eating too much meat.</p>\n<p>“When you have a bunch of hens raised in a factory farm, it’s incredibly efficient but it also concentrates waste and concentrates byproducts and they’re not allowed to permeate through the soil in a natural way,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>However, he said the biggest motivation for the project is a “moral obligation” to decrease animal cruelty in the meat and dairy industry.</p>\n<p>“It’s not really directly connected to sustainability and nutrition, it’s more about how … we treat animals, and, to me, those are morally equivalent,” Lazarus said.</p>\n<p>A California law passed in January 2015 required an increase in space allocation for factory farm chickens. Another law, AB-1437, banned the selling of eggs from chickens raised in small, wire “battery” cages with limited space.</p>\n<p>However, Farm Forward and UCen Dining are still concerned with the animals’ living conditions in the factory farm industry, as many factories do not give birds outdoor access, and some slaughter their animals by hanging them upside down and electrocuting them.</p>\n<p>According to deCoriolis, over 90 percent of American poultry is raised on factory farms.</p>\n<p>“[The program is] led because students and employees are saying [that] ‘we want better products, we want more plants, we want fewer animals,’” deCoriolis said. “‘And if we are going to eat animals, we want to eat animals that are raised in really great ways.’”</p>\n<p>DeCoriolis said he believes that the move from factory farms will be possible at UCSB due to its reputation as a sustainable and environmentally aware campus.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been working with … several of the UCs to help them look at their supply chain and look at the kind of products that they buy and serve and help them understand what those products really look like and understand whether or not those products align with their institutional values,” deCoriolis said.</p>\n<p>Audrey Horn, second-year biopsychology major, has been working with Lazarus and deCoriolis to implement the changes into the UCen catering services. She became involved with the program after learning about the ways factory farm animals were raised and slaughtered.</p>\n<p>Horn said she hopes more students realize the harmful ways animals are being handled on factory farms and plans to connect with movements at other universities for improved farm animal treatment.</p>\n<p>“Students have a serious impact, but we don’t realize it,” Horn said. “Everything we’re doing, and everything that’s going on, so much more can happen if more students knew about it. Changes will happen at UCSB if the students want changes to happen.”</p>\n<p>Horn said the push for cruelty-free farms will not stop with cage-free eggs.</p>\n<p>“Cage-free is a step, which is really exciting, but that’s not the final goal,” Horn said. “The final goal is to be certified humane … the best of the best quality.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p.3 of the Thursday, May 19, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Senate has approved two bills to ensure a timely investigation into bribery allegations made against the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) during the A.S. Spring Election.</p>\n<p>The A.S. Elections Board called for a “re-vote” of the entire spring election ballot in April, alleging that the IFC “bribed” students to vote by awarding “philanthropy grants” to chapters with the highest voter turnout.</p>\n<p>In an opinion piece <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2016-04-27/statement-from-inter-fraternity-council-president-regarding-allegations-of-bribery-in-a-s-elections/\" target=\"_blank\">published in the <em>Nexus</em></a>, IFC President Brendan Gonzalez said IFC consulted with the Office of Student Life prior to developing the grant program.</p>\n<p>Since these claims were made, the UCSB Audit and Advisory Department has been leading an investigation into possible irregularities in the voting process.</p>\n<p>The senate first approved a resolution to extend senators’ terms into Week Nine of Spring Quarter in case the investigatory report is released shortly before summer.</p>\n<p>The senators-elect are usually sworn in during the week eight Senate meeting; however, according to current A.S President Jimmy Villarreal, this resolution will “push everything back” and give the current Senate more time to deliberate on the results if they should come in before the year ends.</p>\n<p>Robert Tarsia, director of the Audit and Advisory Services, said the department hopes the investigation will be completed by the end of Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>“We’ve devoted resources to doing our best,” said Tarsia. “That always depends on the availability of the people we speak with, but we’re having pretty good success.”</p>\n<p>Senate also approved the formation of the “Villarreal Election Commission,” named after President Villarreal. The commission will consider the final investigatory report if the investigation continues into summer.</p>\n<p>Villarreal said he hopes to appoint 10 members to the commission, seven to vote and three to act as ex-officio members. These appointed commissioners will be chosen from the judicial, legislative and executive branches of A.S. and must be nonpartisan.</p>\n<p>According to the proposals, there is “no known timeline” for investigating the bribery allegations against IFC, making the precautionary resolutions important in completing a full investigation.</p>\n<p>“We don’t know when this investigation is going to end,” Villarreal said. “Whenever that investigation and report comes out … someone needs to receive it.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal proposed both resolutions at last week’s Senate meeting and submitted a co-authored letter with President-elect Austin Hechler further detailing the resolutions and each of their commitments to A.S.</p>\n<p>“We just don’t have any guarantee that anyone is going to be around to make those decisions,” Villarreal added.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to try to find as many people who are as removed from this election as possible, whether that means they were helping out, they were endorsing [or] they were actively running,” Villarreal said.</p>\n<p>While A.S. Attorney General Brandon Lee is also investigating the alleged bribery, Tarsia said the Audit and Advisory Department’s investigation is not connected to Lee’s.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty standard to make sure that you touch base with anyone else who’s doing a parallel investigation,” Tarsia said. “But we’re not in any way coordinating our efforts or sharing information.”</p>\n<p>Villarreal will

Housing Tenants’ Association argued in a statement Tuesday that the rent increase scheduled to begin this summer is unfair, due to what it says are subpar living conditions.</p>\n<p>On Monday, UCSB Housing and Residential Services (H&amp;RS) proposed a 12.2 percent rent increase for the West Campus Family Student Housing and a three percent rent increase at Storke Family Student Housing beginning July 1.</p>\n<p>In response to the proposed increases, the Tenants’ Association called the rent hikes “unfair,” due to what it says are poor living conditions at the residences and the extended construction of university-owned housing. The Tenants’ Association is calling upon the university, Residential Services and the Office of the President (UCOP) to end all future rent increases.</p>\n<p>Martin Shumaker, Director of Business and Financial Planning at H&amp;RS, said family student housing rent increases three percent each year, according to the department’s long-term rent plan. These increases correspond to operating costs such as labor costs and utilities, Shumaker said.</p>\n<p>Shumaker said the Tenants’ Association initially requested, in March 2014, that the university freeze rent for West Campus during the two-year construction of the Sierra Madre apartments. He said the university and the Tenants’ Association both agreed to this proposal, with a stipulation that the rates raise to fit the long-term plan at the end of the two-year period.</p>\n<p>Now that construction for Sierra Madre apartments is complete, the proposed 9.2 percent rent increase for West Campus Family Student Housing makes up for the two years of frozen rent, according to H&amp;RS officials. Combined with the annual three percent increase, this will amount to a 12.2 percent increase.</p>\n<p>Jessica Parfrey, Tenants’ Association Board president and a West Campus resident, said the Tenants’ Association’s goal is to encourage the housing department to improve the living quality at family student housing, not to “shame” the university.</p>\n<p>“There’s all this investment going on around us and no significant money being put into our living conditions, other than getting things up to code, which in my opinion is not an improvement to the amenities,” said Parfrey, third-year environmental studies and biological anthropology double major.</p>\n<p>“The three percent is standard … it happens not just in family housing; it happens in all of our residential units,” said Jessica Fougere, placement service manager of housing and residential services. “So there’s always a percentage increase; because everything goes up in cost each year, the cost of anybody living anywhere goes up.”</p>\n<p>Residents of university-owned housing have voiced concern over the rent increase and explained that issues such as unsanitary living conditions, outdated plumbing and inadequate kitchenware should invalidate higher costs for student families.</p>\n<p>“It infuriates me to think us students who come here with our families . . . have to live in these conditions, whether we like it or not, because it’s all that’s available to us in the affordable housing shortage of [Isla Vista] and larger Santa Barbara area,” said Jessica Foster, a fifth-year environmental studies major and West Campus resident, in an email.</p>\n<p>“West Campus is a half-dilapidated, subpar housing complex for student families,” said Brian Griffith, a graduate student who lives on West Campus. “We have lead-based paint in our homes. We have dirty water . . . We have, and have had, construction all around us for several years … If anything, these deteriorating living conditions deserve a rent decrease. So the least housing can do is freeze our rental rates as they are.”</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A featured image initially showed West Campus Faculty Housing, it now shows West Campus Family Housing.</em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on p. 3 of the Thursday, May 5, 2016 print edition of the</em> Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

graduated in the last 15 years.</p>\n<p>To access the large, digitally active portion of UCSB’s alumni, the university is hosting “UCSB Give Day,” its first 24-hour online donation drive on Friday, to increase donor participation in student organizations, financial aid, scholarships and faculty research.</p>\n<p>“Give Day is a 24-hour event using social media channels to digitally connect to our UCSB communities,” said Beverly Colgate, associate vice-chancellor. “It is also a concentrated outreach to our campus’ massive base of young alumni.”</p>\n<p>According to Colgate, the university has raised “matching gifts” from donors to have their dollars match another donor’s area of passion, making fundraising more “personal.” If a donor contributes at a specific time, their donation can be matched with a campus organization of their choice.</p>\n<p>“Our giving website will post the time intervals when these matching gifts are available for matching,” Colgate said. “A couple of our Gaucho celebrities gave matching gifts, too.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The inaugural effort is perhaps less about that single day as it is about what [Friday] will usher in: a whole new era of fundraising at UCSB,” — Beverly Colgate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>UCSB First will also be tabling in front of the library on Friday to discuss the significance of philanthropy on campus. The organization will hand out T-shirts and offer photo opportunities for students to learn about the social media campaign.</p>\n<p>John Lofthus, UCSB Alumni Association associate director, said 60,000 students have graduated in the last ten years, and he hopes the young generation of alumni will digitally connect with the university, improving a nation-wide decline in percentage of alumni giving.</p>\n<p>“Young alumni are proven to be very philanthropic, but they’re wanting to invest through their philanthropy for causes they really believe in,” Lofthus said. “For us, because having alumni support is critical, it’s trying to think about how can we do a better job of connecting with our alumni. And this is one of those ways we’re hoping to do that.”</p>\n<p>An alumni group in London will be <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ucsb-gauchos-at-the-gaucho-tower-bridge-tickets-24303781264\" target=\"_blank\">hosting</a> their own Give Day at The Gaucho restaurant, showing how the event is reaching alumni “far and near,” Lofthus said.</p>\n<p>Colgate said the “community is really ready for this,” and explained that Give Day has already prompted alumni to show support for UCSB on their own social networking sites.</p>\n<p>“I cannot believe all the excitement I am seeing from our alumni, students and staff,” Colgate said in an email. “We have alumni who have volunteered to be “Digital Ambassadors” on Friday and proactively push the Give Day messaging through their social media channels.”</p>\n<p>Online fundraising is “immediate,” Colgate said, and allows donors to choose specific areas for support that they are most passionate about.</p>\n<p>“We have had an online giving site for many years, but this is the first UCSB Give Day where we focus on promoting online giving for 24 hours straight,” Colgate said in an email. “The inaugural effort is perhaps less about that single day as it is about what [Friday] will usher in: a whole new era of fundraising at UCSB.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66219\" style=\"width: 5482px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img

it is that UCSB is hosting our first ever Give Day.”</p>\n<p>Frame said she hopes the online aspect of the fundraiser will create an easy way for alumni to access the university.</p>\n<p>“From a student perspective, I can predict that engaging online, whether that be via the official Give Day website, social media or word-of-mouth, will be an accessible way for students to get involved,” Frame said.</p>\n<p>Colgate said she is proud the university is using technology to support the campus in a joint effort with students and alumni.</p>\n<p>“Social media outreach is being used at many institutions, so we’re right in the middle of this wave,” Colgate said in an email. “This is a way to reach a constituency that is involved in non-traditional fundraising.”</p>\n<p>UCSB Give Day will
