Yang several weeks ago if he would fix the flame to remain lit through rain or wind, but arrived to find the flame already burning.</p>\n<p>“We came a little disappointed that we didn’t get to do the ceremony as we’d asked, but we were happy that it was lit,” Williams said. “I was confident it would stay lit.”</p>\n<p>However, as Williams honored the memorial on Wednesday, the flame continued to go out.</p>\n<p>Williams hopes students encourage the university to make “a mental shift” to prioritize the Eternal Flame.</p>\n<p>“Here’s the University of California, whose scientists have made all our nuclear weapons, and now the chancellor is even an electrical engineer, and I’m sure they can figure out how to keep a flame burning without the wind or the rain blowing it out,” Williams said. “But it’s just not important enough, and it won’t be important enough, I believe, until the students make it important enough.”</p>\n<p>Andrea Estrada, a spokesperson for UCSB, explained that in order for the flame to burn regularly, a new underground gas line and starter would need to be installed.</p>\n<p>“A number of fixes have been attempted in the past, but they haven’t addressed the main problems,” Estrada said, adding that it was important that the university find a “more permanent fix” before taking additional action.</p>\n<p>“It is being discussed and certainly we don’t want to have an eternal flame that’s not functioning,” Estrada said.</p>\n<p>Williams said although fixing the flame may be expensive, it is significant to community members and leaders who have worked to preserve the historic flame.</p>\n<p>If the flame is not fixed, “it’s going to be disappointing for a lot of people,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>If the flame is eventually lit, it will be carried in the Annual Global Peace Walk from Taos, N.M. to Santa Fe. It will then be carried in the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Peace March in summer where it will travel from New York City to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to The White House.</p>\n<p>Williams, who called himself a “peace movement activist and a spiritual practitioner” began the Rainbow Uprising of Consciousness Campaign in 1990 and has been passionate about keeping the Eternal Flame lit since the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The Eternal Flame monument was given as a gift to the university from the UCSB class of 1968.</p>\n<p>Williams stressed the importance of UCSB’s Eternal Flame and its extensive history, including its being lit in 1990 with the Hiroshima Peace Flame, a peace symbol after the end of World War II.</p>\n<p>“[That flame] was lit in the [1990s] as a prayer for peace that Hiroshima should never happen again anywhere in the world,” Williams said.</p>\n<p>“And then, they’ve kept that burning as an eternal flame ever since in Hiroshima,” he continued. “As far as I know, [UCSB] is the only place in the United States where a Hiroshima peace flame was installed on an outdoor public monument. That’s why it’s so important: it’s a symbol.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-68984\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-68984\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-03-10/ucsbs-eternal-flame-goes-out-during-ceremonial-lighting-university-urged-to-fix-flame/","id":2517,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2516,2515,2514],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Anscombe Society Hosts Event Debating Constitutional Right of Same-Sex Marriage","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/New-Logo-Featured.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/New-Logo-Featured.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Anscombe Society, an organization advocating against same-sex marriage, hosted a debate titled “After Obergefell: The Impact on Marriage and Religious Liberty” Thursday night in the Psych...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB Anscombe Society, an organization advocating against same-sex marriage, hosted a debate titled “After Obergefell: The Impact on Marriage and Religious Liberty” Thursday night in the Psychology building.</p>\n<p>The debate focused on Obergefell v. Hodges, the June 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. Dr. Ryan T. Anderson and UCSB professor of philosophy Dr. Quentin Gee argued the deeper issues of same-sex marriage, such as religion, the definition of marriage and social equality.</p>\n<p>Gee, who advocated in favor of the recent ruling, said marriage is an institution that is constantly changing and should be open to all couples.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is something that is generally defined by the society that we live in, and it changes,” Gee said. “The civil institution of marriage has undergone a number of transformational shifts. People should come to realize that the civil institution of marriage is something that should be expanded to same-sex couples.”</p>\n<p>Gee said the idea of marriage is not a “biological feature of humans,” but rather dynamic and culturally constructed.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is something that humans together collectively define in a particular way,” Gee said. “We’re expanding this notion that marriage is this idea of freedom of the individual to choose these relationships of mutual support between two people.”</p>\n<p>Gee said marriage is a “social institution” and focused his argument on the idea that marriage is not strictly for procreational purposes.</p>\n<p>“We’re changing our conception of marriage,” Gee said. “The conception of marriage has changed to what we might call a companionate sense. When you marry somebody, you are taking on an additional life partner, a companion.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, religion cannot be used as a legitimate excuse to refuse same-sex marriage and said if it is used, it is on the basis of discrimination.</p>\n<p>“There’s no clear reason to exclude same-sex couples [from marriage]. They can offer elements of companionship,” Gee said. “I don’t see any real, compelling reason, and if there is no compelling reason, it’s seems to be more or less a prejudice.”</p>\n<p>Gee said while religion is important to society, it cannot be used to enforce a law that denies rights to same-sex couples.</p>\n<p>“You cannot use religious reasons to justify or create social institutions or social contracts in ways to suit your religious needs,” Gee said. “Everyone ought to respect religion and appreciate the things it brings to our lives, but at the same time, we cannot impose it. And laws impose.”</p>\n<p>According to Gee, there is no valid reason to deny same-sex couples the right to wed in any state, and said he believes religion cannot justify the rejection of their marriage.</p>\n<p>“There really isn’t a clear, justifiable reason to limit [marriage] to between a man and a woman alone,” Gee said. “I would say that you cannot use religious motivations for limiting the institution of marriage to simply a man and a woman.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Ryan T. Anderson, opponent to the Supreme Court ruling, said he supports a “conjugal vision of marriage” which presents men and women as pairs to unite as one person.</p>\n<p>“Marriage is primarily a comprehensive union of sexual complementary spouses where man and a woman unite as one flesh,” Anderson said. “The act that makes them one flesh has the capacity to create new life, and that relationship of husband and wife has the capacity to create a child with both a mother and a father.”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, since the U.S. Constitution does not mention what concept of marriage is correct, it is up to citizens to create laws on how marriages should be governed.</p>\n<p>“The 14th Amendment to the Constitution is silent to which one of those visions is true or good or the best,” Anderson said. “And where the Constitution is silent, we the people retain constitutional authority to make laws.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the flaw in the Supreme Court ruling was that it bypassed constitutional laws by enacting its own opinion on the nation.</p>\n<p>“It imposed that philosophy of marriage on the entire nation under the guise of constitutional law,” Anderson said. “There is no constitutional justification whatsoever by five unelected judges to say, ‘our preferred philosophy of marriage is now required of all fifty states simply because of our fiat.’”</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, the Supreme Court violated the Constitution and said this should be a concern for all informed Americans.</p>\n<p>If you care about constitutional, democratic self-governance, you have to care about the judicial usurpation of politics, which is what took place in Obergefell,” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Anderson disputed Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s reasoning for the ruling and said the future of marriage will constantly be changed to suit different needs.</p>\n<p>“If you think about the actual arguments that Justice Kennedy made to justify his philosophy of marriage, and simply think though, what does it mean for the future of marriage? It means that marriage will simply be redefined as contract law,” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>According to Anderson, Justice Kennedy’s ruling will cause marriage to be continuously redefined in the future.</p>\n<p>“What’s the legal principle for monogamy?” Anderson said. “What prevents future redefinitions of marriage?”</p>\n<p>Anderson said the Obergefell ruling has already affected religiously based businesses and charity organizations that refuse to support the new law.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already seen in jurisdictions where marriages have been redefined where faith-based adoption agencies have been shut down, where schools are beginning to lose their accreditation,” Anderson said. “We’ve seen bakers, florists, photographers penalized not because they said they refuse to serve gay people; their only objection was to baking the same-sex wedding cake or doing the alter flowers for a same-sex marriage.”</p>\n<p>Anderson told the story of a florist who refused to create an arrangement for a same-sex wedding. The women was sued by her state, lost the first round of her legal battles and has appealed to an appellate court.</p>\n<p>“She should have a constitutional right after Obergefell not to be forced to violate her beliefs,” Anderson said. “The Supreme Court says same-sex couple have a right to get marriage, but that doesn’t place a duty upon anyone else to help celebrate that way.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said he hopes there will be a way to discuss the issue and reach a conclusion in a respectful manner.</p>\n<p>“How do we agree to disagree about marriage without persecuting one another, without using the government as a blunt force to impose our values on others?” Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Second-year history and psychology double major Iridian Magallon said before the debate, she was interested to see how Anderson would argue against same-sex marriage without relying on religion.</p>\n<p>“I was really curious as to what the arguments [Anderson] would propose, because I always thought the main argument against same sex marriage was religion,” Magallon said. “So I was curious how he was going to argue without using religion.”</p>\n<p>Magallon said she was surprised that Anderson argued his opinion well, but ultimately agreed with Professor Gee.</p>\n<p>“It was interesting that he was able to argue that side pretty well,” Magallon said. “[In the end], I was still on [Gee’s] side.”</p>\n<p>According to second-year economics and accounting major Andrew Gates, the Supreme Court ruling was unconstitutional and denied state’s rights.</p>\n<p>“The decision of Obergefell was an issue of state’s rights, and I do believe the Supreme Court was engaging in judicial fiat or judicial activism, in that they were not concerned about what the Constitution said about marriage, but rather what they believed,” Gates said. “The issue is that do the states have the right to choose should same-sex marriage be allowed, and I fully believe they should.”</p>\n<p>Gates said he was originally opposed to the Obergefell ruling and believes the Supreme Court was not justified in its action because the federal government involved itself in a state issue.</p>\n<p>“I was against the Supreme Court ruling, and I’m still against it,” Gates said. “Personally, I don’t have any problem with the state legalizing same sex marriage, but the issue is, ‘do you believe in self-governance in a constitutional republic?’ If you do, you would recognize the state right to define marriage is the state’s right, and the federal government should not interfere.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

The Nexus reccommends wearing proper footwear and leaving extra early for class, amongst other helpful tips. <em>Lorenzo Basilio / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>As UCSB students walked to class this morning clad in rubber boots and rain jackets and carrying umbrellas for extra measure, they took a look around at their fellow Gauchos. The look on everyone’s face read one word: misery. The bikers were wiping rain (or were they tears?) off their faces; the walkers were trying to keep their umbrellas intact against the ferocious wind. Everyone was asking one big question: “How do I become more waterproof?”</p>\n<p>The answer is in genetics. We are Santa Barbarans and, more importantly, we are Southern Californians. Our people have lived for ages in the land of deserts and droughts, and when the words “El Niño” come up, we start to shake in our flip flops.</p>\n<p>So, here are some rain tips for all you Gauchos as you brave El Niño and any other wet conditions you may endure in your young lives.</p>\n<h4>Stay Dry:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The best shoes for wet weather are any type of rain boot, such as Hunter or L.L. Bean. If you don’t want to spend too much money, an old pair of Converse will get you across campus and back to Isla Vista with minimal damage.</li>\n<li>Waterproof jackets are essential whether you have an umbrella or not. For bikers, if you do not have a bike seat cover, wear a longer jacket to separate you from that wet bike seat after your 10 a.m. lecture.</li>\n<li>Dress in layers. The worst that could happen is being dressed for winter in Seattle and, by midday, it’s summer in San Diego.</li>\n<li>The skies are gray … so wear something colorful! You could brighten your day and even someone else’s.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Protect Your Home:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Check your roof for sagging and dark spots. If you see outside light coming in, you might end up with a messy leak all over your living room floor.</li>\n<li>Call your landlord immediately if you see signs of damage so you can fix the problems before the rain continues.</li>\n<li>Grab yourself some buckets. If you have leaks already, put a bucket underneath them to prevent the rain from ruining your floors. When the bucket fills up with water, go find a garden to water.</li>\n<li>Be watchful of erosion on cliffside homes.</li>\n<li>Clean your gutters of leaves and dirt, and make sure there is a clear path for water to flow.</li>\n<li>Cover outdoor furniture to prevent damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Bike Safely:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Give yourself extra time before heading to class so you can be cautious of slick bike paths and other bikers.</li>\n<li>Cover your bike seat with a plastic bag. Bring a couple extras with you just in case it rains while you’re in class.</li>\n<li>Be wary of rainbow patches on the bike paths. While they might look pretty, remember that they are built-up oil puddles, and they’re slick.</li>\n<li>Avoid puddles. Save yourself and everyone around you. Please.</li>\n<li>Cherish the knowing glances between you and other bikers as you make that adventure from the 67 block of Trigo to your lecture in the Chem building. You’re all in this together.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Have Fun:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy popcorn and hot chocolate, and sit down with your favorite Netflix series when it looks too unbearable to venture outside.</li>\n<li>If you can, enjoy it. Jump in puddles, slide through the mud and catch raindrops on your tongue. Who knows when it’ll rain like this again?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 1 of the Thursday, January 7, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

movement against Russian president Vladimir Putin in a lecture titled “Winter is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped” in Campbell Hall Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>Garry Kasparov was born in the Soviet Union in 1963 and rose to international fame at the age of 22 when he became the youngest world chess champion in 1985. He grew increasingly politically active in 2005 and in 2008 ran against Putin in the Russian Presidential race. Kasparov shared about his experience as a political activist and why he thinks Putin is a global threat.</p>\n<p>Kasparov said when he began winning chess games, he realized he had a sense of responsibility to his country as a champion to address the political changes in Russia.</p>\n<p>“Winning the championship, I had some kind of responsibility,” Kasparov said. “I had to demonstrate to people that when Kasparov won, there was going to be change.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he does not know what the future holds for the power struggles between Putin and the free world, but Putin will be focused on remaining in power as democracies attempt to compromise with him.</p>\n<p>“Putin thinks about survival,” Kasparov said. “The free world is searching so desperately for common ground, democracies are slow to respond and they need strategy.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Putin’s] interest is in the opposition of the free world. He can’t afford stability because then he has to compete — he’s a loser.<br>\n<em>– Garry Kasparov</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Kasparov said he was disappointed with how President George H.W. Bush and President Obama intervened in Russian politics and said Putin has benefited from their “inadequate approaches.”</p>\n<p>“Bush did too much, Obama has done nothing,” Kasparov said. “They always believe the Soviet Union after the Cold War could have been better. [Putin] could benefit from that general belief of working together.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he believes Putin is uninterested in finding common ground with the free world because he knows he will be unable to compete with it.</p>\n<p>“[Putin’s] interest is in the opposition of the free world,” Kasparov said. “He can’t afford stability because then he has to compete — he’s a loser.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said he rejects the idea that Putin’s strategy is like a game of chess. According to Kasparov, chess is a game of rules and Putin does not abide by rules.</p>\n<p>“Putin is not playing chess because it’s a transparent game,” Kasparov said. “He plays a different game because he can win by bluffing. He can win by bluffing and blackmail.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said Putin can be “defeated” when Russian citizens believe he is no longer powerful.</p>\n<p>“Putin must demonstrate that he is no longer invincible,” Kasparov said. “The system must look weak in the eyes of his subjects. It’s all about political will that is so far not here. Putin is indispensible because everyone thinks he’s indispensable.”</p>\n<p>Kasparov said about “30 percent” of his life is now dedicated to chess, and he enjoys it because it possesses the rules that politics lack.</p>\n<p>“It helps keep my brain in good shape,” Kasparov said. “Chess has rules. I feel more confident when I play by the rules.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year history major Audrey Dalton said the most notable topic from the lecture was the idea that “dictators need enemies.”</p>\n<p>“I feel that sums up a lot of what [Kasparov] said. That’s why Putin is going to keep persecuting and starting wars in other places because he needs to justify his existence,” Dalton said. “Kasparov clearly has an informed opinion.”</p>\n<p>Second-year political science major Diana Hernandez said she was interested in learning more about Putin to understand Kasparov’s actions.</p>\n<p>“I had a basic overview, but I don’t know that much about it, so that’s why I wanted to come,” Hernandez said. “I want to know the details of Kasparov’s decision, what he stands for and why is he against Putin.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year German and economics double-major Michael Göpper said he is interested in Russian politics because of Germany’s geographical proximity to Russia.</p>\n<p>“About the topic of Russian politics, I think I know quite a lot from reading German newspaper, because Russia’s not too far away from Germany or Europe in general,” Göpper said. “I’m really interested in Russian politics and Russian foreign relations and the issues that are involved in that.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66594\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/former-world-chess-champion-russian-political-activist-speaks-on-enemies-of-the-free-world/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66594\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/former-world-chess-champion-russian-political-activist-speaks-on-enemies-of-the-free-world/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/former-world-chess-champion-russian-political-activist-speaks-on-enemies-of-the-free-world/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/former-world-chess-champion-russian-political-activist-speaks-on-enemies-of-the-free-world/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-18/former-world-chess-champion-russian-political-activist-speaks-on-enemies-of-the-free-world/","id":2617,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2616,2615,2614],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program To Host Conference To De-stigmatize Alcohol and Drug Recovery","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/header_aod2013.jpg?resize=355%2C105&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/header_aod2013.jpg?resize=377%2C105&ssl=1","description":"The UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program will host the California Unified Collegiate Recovery Program Nov. 7 and 8 in Corwin Pavilion to de-stigmatize alcohol and drug addictions and educate UCSB and SBCC st...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program will host the California Unified Collegiate Recovery Program Nov. 7 and 8 in Corwin Pavilion to de-stigmatize alcohol and drug addictions and educate UCSB and SBCC students about resources for recovery.</p>\n<p>The conference will host keynote speakers American Buddhist teacher and personal wellness believer Noah Levine, President and CEO of Young People in Recovery Justin Luke Riley and UC Riverside collegiate recovery program advisor Audrey Pusey. Each speaker will present an individual topic about the struggles and successes relating to recovery. Sponsors will offer resources and information to students, with organizers anticipating attendees from across the UC and out of state.</p>\n<p>UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program counselor and recovery specialist Angie Bryan said the conference can help break down preconceptions about the recovery process while creating a community for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“One goal is to bring students together in recovery just for fellowship and mutual support,” Bryan said. “We’re trying to promote awareness about being in recovery, and that people in recovery are assets to a college community … to reduce the stigma about being in recovery in college.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the recovery movement began at UCSB four years ago with the assistance of UC Riverside and has grown into a UC-wide program for addiction recovery.</p>\n<p>“I think initially the goal was to help start the movement in California,” Bryan said. “Four years ago, we were just starting our program here and Riverside had a student group, but there wasn’t else much happening in our state. Now we have collegiate recovery programs at most of the UCs.”</p>\n<p>Second-year psychology major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Adam Daar said UC Riverside supports UCSB in hosting the event.</p>\n<p>“UC Riverside wanted to keep it student led, and I think that people liked the idea of bringing it to Santa Barbara because they saw that we had a strong collegiate recovery program community already,” Daar said. “We are really happy to be able to do this.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year global studies major and recovery intern for Gauchos for Recovery Emily Bills, recovery programs have been growing rapidly in recent years and UCSB has one of the best programs to host the conference.</p>\n<p>“There are only so many recovery programs in California that are able to host. We have a huge support from the Alcohol and Drug Program that no other schools really have,” Bills said.</p>\n<p>According to Director of UCSB Alcohol and Drug Program Jackie Kurta, the process of recovery will be destigmatized throughout the conference. Kurta said she hopes this will lead to more acknowledgement and support for recovering students.</p>\n<p>“I think there are assumptions made about how college students lead their lives,” Kurta said. “There’s stigma about people being in recovery or students who were struggling and not yet able to make a choice that is working well for them. I think our community needs to be more sensitive to being helpful and supportive and not being judging and off-putting in that way.”</p>\n<p>Kurta said the conference will also showcase UCSB’s efforts to improve the lives of students dealing with addiction and recovery.</p>\n<p>“We all saw it as a terrific opportunity to bring attention to the work that is being done and to applaud the efforts of the program and to bring some recognition to our campus, because people don’t always think of UCSB and sober living,” Kurta said. “It was an opportunity to say we have a thriving program, we have a very diverse community and our community can include students in recovery.”</p>\n<p>Daar said he hopes the conference can help unify colleges and create diverse alcohol and drug programs at different universities.</p>\n<p>“I think something the conference can do is [help] other schools with their recovery program and learn about our own and cultivate a space of learning … and expand the national recovery movement, especially on college campuses,” Daar said.</p>\n<p>Daar said all students and UCSB staff are welcome to attend the conference and can volunteer for the event to learn about recovery.</p>\n<p>“They can reach out to us and sign up for volunteer shifts,” Daar said. “They get free admission and are welcome to help out and attend the entire conference — they get all the information that is really guided for students.”</p>\n<p>Daar said if students are struggling with an addiction they should seek help and know that recovery teams are there for support.</p>\n<p>“Try really hard to not be afraid to ask for help. Know that no one in this recovery community is going to judge you for asking for help,” Daar said. “They can come to us to ask for help and they will be welcomed with open arms. I want them to know that.”</p>\n<p>Bryan said the resources offered at the conference can be of help to anyone affected by addiction.</p>\n<p>“I just want to emphasize that everybody is touched by addiction in some way, whether it’s personally or [through] a friend or family member,” Bryan said. “I think that anyone could get something out of the conference.”</p>\n<p>The Alcohol and Drug Program offers weekly meetings open to all community members and hosts quarterly events. Services are primarily free to all students, including resources for being an ally in recovery.</p>\n<p>For more information about the conference and registration, visit

and drought sustainability. <em>Paris Cullen/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UCSB is participating in the UC-wide #UCool Campus Challenge from Oct. 6 to Dec. 10 in an effort to reduce the University’s carbon footprint and make positive contributions to the environment.</p>\n<p>University of California and UC Berkeley’s Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory created #UCool with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025. The campaign, modeled after the Cool California Cities Challenge, encourages students to accumulate points for each university by completing 50 online pledge challenges. The pledges include energy efficient moves such as switching to LED lighting and turning off computer monitors. Participants will have opportunities to win eco-efficient prizes such as solar-powered cellphone chargers, and the university with the highest score will be deemed the “Coolest UC Campus.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Chris Berry said the challenge will require a large amount of student participation to be effective, but he hopes the goal of carbon neutrality will be reached.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a really cool campaign, and [with] more incentive for students to do it, it could be meaningful,” Berry said. “If we really are interested in [achieving] carbon neutrality, the school can do all they can, but if you have students who don’t care and don’t do work, we’re not going to achieve that goal.”</p>\n<p>Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-chair and third-year computer science and environmental studies double-major Nicholas Frey said the most difficult part of the #UCool challenge is encouraging students to participate in the event.</p>\n<p>“One of the harder challenges is changing people’s behavior on things,” Frey said. “One of the major issues is getting the student population engaged and educated on how they can be sustainable in their actions.”</p>\n<p>According to Frey, UCSB needs total student and faculty involvement for the campaign to achieve the 2025 goal.</p>\n<p>“I think you need infrastructure change, so you need to be, like, adding solar on campus to make it carbon neutral, but I don’t think it’s totally possible if you don’t have faculty and student engagement,” Frey said. “The whole campus can’t become carbon neutral if it’s just the facilities; it has to be the people also.”</p>\n<p>Frey said students should contribute anything they can to the challenge even if they cannot be consistent in their actions.</p>\n<p>“[A misconception] is that you have to be absolutely perfect, and if you slip up you’ll be criticized. That’s not the point; people shouldn’t feel … discouraged to be sustainable,” Frey said. “We don’t live in a world where being some perfect hippie environmentalist is even possible. I just encourage people to learn and explore.”</p>\n<p>According to Associated Students Environmental Program Director Sarah Siedschlag, UCSB has already made great strides towards becoming more environmentally friendly.</p>\n<p>“UCSB has done a lot. For a research university of our size, we’re actually very good in water conservation … the vast majority of our landscape is done with recycled water,” Siedschlag said. “We are prepared, or becoming prepared, for a situation in the future where we might just have longer and longer droughts.”<br>\nSiedschlag said she hopes the Cool Campus Challenge will encourage students and faculty to “engage as groups” in efforts toward environmental conservation.</p>\n<p>“I’m hoping that it gets students to think about it and also makes it something that people talk about and is part of their daily lives, and that people don’t just do themselves but encourage their friends to do,” Siedschlag said. “I think that’s what’s really fun — people are building teams with the Cool Campus Challenge and getting really competitive about it.”</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UC achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 is an attainable goal.</p>\n<p>“I think it depends on what you include and how far you are willing to go,” Siedschlag said.</p>\n<p>According to professor of sociology John Foran, the environment is the “defining issue” of the century.</p>\n<p>“The biggest issue is climate change. It is the biggest existential threat to humanity ever because it calls the whole future into question,” Foran said. “We really have to make deep, deep changes in the ways we organize ourselves in society.”</p>\n<p>According to Foran, converting to a vegetarian or vegan diet is “without question, the single most important” factor in reducing students’ carbon footprint. Foran said the Cool Campus Challenge should emphasize the importance of this change.</p>\n<p>“This is an important thing to underline: the UC Cool Campus Challenge and the perspective of the impact of food, diet and individual behavior change,” Foran said. “The Campus Challenge, as good as it is, needs to be recalibrated to the reality of that. That is good for climate, that is good for our health, pollution, good for the oceans, and it’s good for reducing inequality on a global scale.”</p>\n<p>Berry also said he believes food choices have a very real effect on the environment.</p>\n<p>“One of the biggest things [affecting] environmental climate change is how we eat, and Americans really enjoy meat, and meat is detrimental to the environment, especially in the way it is produced,” Berry said.</p>\n<p>According to Siedschlag, UCSB has a good chance at winning the challenge because of student and faculty dedication to the environment.</p>\n<p>“I think we do have a good chance,” Siedschlag said. “We’ve got a lot of really dedicated students and a lot of groups that have gotten really into it, there’s still plenty of time left, and I think we can definitely do it.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Thursday, October 22, 2015 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</p><div

California in the coming months, bringing wet weather and the possibility of increased erosion along the cliffs of Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>El Niño is a climatic change that occurs every two to seven years near the equatorial Pacific region. The 2015 El Niño has already affected climate patterns and ocean temperatures in the Pacific region. While winter weather across the country will feel the effects of El Niño, California and other Southern states in particular will experience atypical weather conditions and heavy rain.</p>\n<p>Associate professor of earth sciences Alex Simms said the predicted heavy precipitation may lead to increased erosion.</p>\n<p>“There are higher rates of erosion during El Niño,” Simms said. “If you have one of those houses that is already hanging off the cliff, things are probably going to get bad for you.”</p>\n<p>Associate professor of geology Charles Jones said El Niño is caused by a change in atmosphere that leads to warming waters and heavier moisture.</p>\n<p>“An El Niño is an interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean, especially the tropical oceans,” Jones said. “It has a reoccurrence time of about two to seven years and it has a lot of natural variability.”</p>\n<p>According to Jones, the upcoming El Niño is predicted to be the strongest in nearly two decades.</p>\n<p>“Some forecasters think that it might be similar to the ’97, ’98 El Niño, which was the strongest El Niño on record,” Jones said.</p>\n<p>UCSB alumnus and I.V. resident Molly Morrison, who last year led a campaign to install safety fences along the cliffs of Del Playa Drive, said she is concerned heavy rains may cause damage to the cliffs.</p>\n<p>“I’m not so concerned about the fences as I am about the actual cliff situation,” Morrison said. “Whether the fences can stand or not I don’t think is really the question, but whether the cliffs can.”</p>\n<p>Morrison said even without increased precipitation levels the cliffs are subject to significant erosion each year.</p>\n<p>“On average, the cliffs on this side of Isla Vista are supposed to erode about a foot a year,” Morrison said. “It will be interesting to see, if El Niño does pick up, in winds, velocity … how it will increase cliff erosion rates.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year biology major Connor Dodds said though he lives in a cliffside house on Del Playa, he is not concerned about El Niño.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s going to be any big deal,” Dodds said. “When it’s high tide, the waves have already been hitting the cliff and it hasn’t really been doing much.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year economics and Spanish double major Connor Kulg, Dodds’ housemate, said he looks forward to the improved surf that will come with El Niño.</p>\n<p>“I’m not too worried,” Kulg said. “I’m not looking forward to the rains, but I am looking forward to the big waves.”</p>\n<p>Simms said the cliffs have been eroding for many years, and will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>“This process has been going on for thousands of years, and there is nothing we can do to stop it,” Simms said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;
