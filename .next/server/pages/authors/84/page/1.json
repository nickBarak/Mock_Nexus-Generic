Insist on playing loud country music on DP every Friday afternoon. This way, your neighbors will know for sure you’re country. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Talk about that one time your horse picked you up from school. Everyone will be in awe of how country folk travel, even in the modern age. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Sing exclusively country songs on karaoke night. “Redneck Woman (Hell Yeah)” always gets the crowd moving and leaves a positive message about really not giving a shit. About anything. At all. Even when you should.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Be progressive </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> country and use the inclusive “y’all” when addressing a crowd on Woodstocks Trivia Night. It helps to add a slight twang to your voice so you can give off a vibe of “Southern hospitality” without actual being from a red state. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Those flare jeans and that plaid shirt: DO IT. Denim on denim: DEFINITELY DO IT.

Teach your friends the tenets of all country songs: drinking beer, mama’s cooking, driving down backroads, hometown football games and girls shaking it on the dancefloor. Oh, also God sometimes. Slowly your friends will love and understand the country life as much as you do. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the kids say, “Yee haw.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maura Fox was a closeted country gal throughout college but wants you to know she loves country music and has a real horse named Rosie.

I was unhappy, and I didn’t have a place to call home on campus or in Isla Vista.</p>\n<p>It’s funny how things change.</p>\n<p>I’ve been struck with flashbacks to specific moments at UCSB — like when my roommate, Raechel, and I ran around the lagoon for the first time freshman year, or when I canoed down the Colorado River with the Adventure Programs, or even when I walked through I.V. on one particular Saturday morning, soaking in the pure, hungover magic of it all.</p>\n<p>Over the years, these are the moments that have made me love UCSB, but I can’t tell you enough how much stepping into the <em>Nexus</em> office for the first time changed my life.</p>\n<p>It’s a dark, cold office with too much stale coffee but the perfect amount of old newspapers and dusty books. The people are warm and intelligent, without fail, every passing year and with each new class.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> also does this thing that I love: It preserves memories and moments with every photo, every article and every Thursday print issue. And I hope the <em>Nexus</em> continues to be an emblem for our community, long after I’m gone and I am only left with the memories.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nexus</em> and the people I have met during my time on staff have shaped the person I am today, but the <em>Nexus</em> continues to grow itself. I encourage you to be patient as Nexites learn more about themselves and the kind of journalists they want to be.</p>\n<p>I know we don’t always get it right. We won’t always get it right. It is our job as storytellers to listen to our community and fellow students to ensure that the history we’re preserving is accurate, its people accountable for their actions.</p>\n<p>Jorge Mercado, the next editor in chief, is kind and capable, and will slip a sports reference into most any conversation, if given the opportunity. I hope you pop into his office to chat — his door is always open.</p>\n<p>Goodbyes are strange, but reporting on our community for the <em>Nexus</em> has assured me that I can always reflect on our shared moments documented in archives and stamped onto history. Maybe it’s not even goodbye, after all, its merely the passing of one era and on to the next.</p>\n<p>Thank you to every interviewee, to the dear <em>Nexus</em>, to my best friends and #roommate4life. And to you, UCSB, thanks for making me want to stick around.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the June 7 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-83488\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-83488\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/letter-from-the-editor-for-fox-sake-4-years-sure-flew-by/","id":3656,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[3655,3654,3653],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"IVRPD Appoints New Board Member for Seven-Month Term","category":"News","subcategory":"County","publish_date":"2018-05-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IVRPD-Web_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IVRPD-Web_Alex-Nagase-1.jpg?resize=600%2C397&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District appointed a new member to the board of directors at Thursday’s meeting after a nine-week long position vacancy.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District appointed a new member to the board of directors at Thursday’s meeting after a nine-week long position vacancy.</p>\n<p>Celene Washington, a second-year sociology major, was selected to join the board for the seven-month term.

The project had drawn widespread controversy across A.S. and on social media, largely due to the project’s costs.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited and thrilled that the students had the opportunity to voice their opinion on this issue,” said Hieu Le, current A.S. president and one of the project’s primary supporters. “We need to listen to what the students have to say in terms of supporting a different funding model for it, and that’s something that I stand by.”</p>\n<p>Brooke Kopel was elected as the next A.S president and is the lone executive candidate elected from CU.</p>\n<p>Justice Dumlao, the Isla Vista Party’s candidate for president, said he is undeterred by the loss.</p>\n<p>“It’s not as tough a loss as I think a lot of people think it was,” he said. “People really showed up for us. We had a lot of votes in every category; I’m super proud of all the effort everyone’s put in. It was never about me, and it never will be about me.”</p>\n<p>Dumlao also said he will continue to make change on campus and said he believes the election has encouraged more students from all backgrounds to get involved at the university.</p>\n<p>“For all the unrepresented students out there, for all the queer students, for all the brown students, for all the Pacific Islanders, there’s a spot for you out there,” he said. “Last quarter, the quarter before that, every quarter I’ve been here, I always think I don’t belong here at UCSB. And this race has really shown me that we do belong here.”</p>\n<p>Steven Ho with IVP won the internal vice president position against CU’s Anthony Pimentel by 636 raw votes. Ho is currently an on-campus senator in A.S. senate. Ho and Pimentel declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Sophia Dycaico of CU and off-campus senator lost to IVP’s Jeike Meijer by nearly 600 raw votes for external vice president of local affairs. Meijer has said she will be the first Native American to serve as a UCSB A.S. executive. Dycaico and Meijer declined to comment.</p>\n<p>IVP’s Mayela Morales won the external vice president for statewide affairs (EVPSA) position against Madeline Loudon of CU. Both candidates declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Rose Ettleson lost the vote for student advocate general (S.A.G.) against Grecia Martinez. Ettleson told the Nexus she was not “afraid of any candidate winning” because she believes everyone is competent and qualified.</p>\n<p>“I’m ecstatic about the whole executive slate because every single one is going to do such amazing things. I’m obviously disappointed; I think Grecia will be a great student advocate general,” Ettleson said.</p>\n<p>“I am relieved, ecstatic — it’s been a very long two weeks,” Martinez said after the win. She said she was excited to work with the current S.A.G., Jack Tannenbaum, to analyze statistics behind the election results to see where the students fall on campus issues.</p>\n<p>At a somber post-election meeting, CU party leaders urged those who fell short of elected seats to remain hopeful and active.</p>\n<p>“When I look at all of you here, as a fourth-year exec, you know what I see? I see the future of this fucking campus!” Kristin Hsu, the current EVPSA, told the party. “This is not Associated Students United, this is Campus United!”</p>\n<p>“Whatever happened in there — fuck that!” she added.</p>\n<p>Kopel thanked the CU staffers for their help in her victory and echoed Hsu in telling the party to not give up their fight.</p>\n<p>“Campus United needs to stay united,” she said. “No matter what happens in there, we are the people who are best for this campus … We will come back again, and we will sweep again and again and again, no matter how long it takes.”</p>\n<p>A photo story from the night can be seen <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/in-photos-a-s-elections-2018/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Evelyn Spence, Sanya Kamidi and Jose Ochoa contributed reporting.</em></p>\n<p><em>Correction: Hsu said “Associated Students United,” not “Soviet Students Union” as previously reported.

Lu spent much of his time volunteering, including through beach clean-ups and music lessons in the community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An avid musician, Lu played the french horn in the Woodbridge High School marching band in Irvine, California. Lu also liked to play piano, baseball and work out with friends, often motivating them to exercise harder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alyssa Sanjongio became friends with Lu when the two played the french horn in their middle and high school band. Friends would often call Lu the “ride guy” because he was always willing to give someone a ride in his car if they needed to go somewhere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanjongio described Lu as “iconic” and well-liked, reflecting on when Lu was crowned king of the Winter Formal and the multiple times Lu would fall asleep in class in high school.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She says that Lu’s death has brought many of their high school friends together in a way only Lu could.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Even though it’s really horrible, it’s still like this new sense of connection and strength among all the people that he touched in his life, which is really amazing,” she said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends from high school, including Sanjongio, also attended UCSB. Nathan Ng, a high school and college friend, echoed Sanjongio’s sentiments about Lu, adding that Lu approached everyone with a kindness and humility that is hard to find.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He went out of his way to help people, whether it was people in his normal social group or just people in general. He was very open to seeing how everyone was doing and I greatly respect that,” Ng said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a present and constant part of his friends’ lives, said Eric Kim, a longtime friend of Lu’s and one of his roommates in Santa Cruz Residence Hall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’ve known him for a long time, [and] I always expect his presence,” Kim said. “I’ve gotten used to him.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was also enjoying his time at UCSB, Kim said, adding that Lu was excited to attend the university last summer.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It exceeded expectations when he got here, he was really having a good time, even when he had a lot of work or classes,” Kim said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malcolm Tsay met Lu in middle school and said Lu was “like a brother” to him.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He was just the most helpful person ever,” Tsay said. “He always put other people first. You could talk to him about anything [and] he opened up his heart to everyone.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tsay set up a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/7u33cn-james-lus-funeral-fund\">GoFundMe</a> for Lu’s funeral and has raised over $13,000 so far. He said he wanted to give something back to Lu and help out his family.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lu was a leader, Tsay said, and someone he could look to for guidance, whether it be for music or life advice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This year, I’m drum major of the marching band, and I wouldn’t have those leadership skills without the interactions I’ve shared with James and the advice he’s given me throughout the years,” Tsay said.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another band friend, Aziz Hamza, said he continued to stay in contact with Lu at UCSB to see how he was adjusting to college life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hamza described Lu as dedicated and having a “relaxed presence.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“He’d always be laughing, like, whatever conversation he would be having, it would be something humorous,” Hamza said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of Lu’s friends noted that Lu was on his way to teach piano to children on the day he died.

night of sleep at a fire station in Managua, Nicaragua, after an eight-hour bicycle ride through the Latin country.</p>\n<p>“We had a pretty crazy day,” Connell recounted with a laugh heard through the phone. “It was just hectic with a lot of wind and a lot of sun. We had to ride almost 100 miles, and I ended up getting a flat tire, but we made it to the fire station, which was our goal.”</p>\n<p>Connell and Lee have been on the road biking since Oct. 20, 2017. After graduating from UCSB in the spring of 2017, the two saved up money from summer jobs and decided to embark on a trip from Isla Vista to Colombia, opting for a different mode of transportation than the average traveler.</p>\n<p>“I thought, ‘What better way than to bike there?’” Connell said. “And then I thought, ‘What friend do I have that’s crazy enough to take on an adventure like that as well?’ So I gave Quincy a call.”</p>\n<p>Lee considered the offer for about 10 seconds before saying, “Yup, I’m down.”</p>\n<p>They started biking from the 6800 block of Del Playa Drive, where Connell and Lee were met by friends who biked with them until they reached the edge of campus. They then rode through I.V. and onto campus, past the library and under Henley Gate.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81116\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"636970733\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81085\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81116\" data-attachment-id=\"81116\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/img_7054-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_7054\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81116\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=888%2C666\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1832%2C1374&amp;ssl=1 1832w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1376%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=1044%2C783&amp;ssl=1 1044w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1 632w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?resize=536%2C402&amp;ssl=1 536w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_7054.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Connell and Lee began their journey in Isla Vista, biking through town and campus before riding under Henley Gate. They made it to Malibu on their first day of biking. <em>Courtesy of Daniel Connell</em></p></div>\n<p>“Our first day, we rode out of I.V. through Santa Barbara. We ended up in Malibu that day, and up until that point, that was the longest bike ride of my life,” Lee said, adding that since then, he’s easily doubled the time he spends on his bike.</p>\n<p>“It was pretty significant because the last four years of our life were at UCSB,” Connell reflected. “That was our home, and it was a significant change to actually leave from that home to start this new segment of our lives.”</p>\n<p>After reaching the U.S. border, they spent 80 days exploring Mexico until they reached Belize. From there, they traveled through Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Monday night’s rest in Nicaragua was another stop on their journey as they prepare to bike through Costa Rica and Panama until reaching Colombia.</p>\n<p>But the two will remind you that it’s not really about the destination anymore, after having interacted with folks in numerous cities on their journey. They say they have experienced generosity, hospitality and love as they have been welcomed into the homes of strangers.</p>\n<p>“I think when we arrive in Colombia, we’re going to have a list of about 250 people we’ll need to call, like ‘We made it!’” Lee laughed. “Not even people from back home, but people we met along the way.”</p>\n<p>Connell says after 100 days on the road, they have not yet paid for a place to sleep, instead relying on the kindness of locals ― including families, firemen and policemen ― who welcome them into their homes and workspaces. Other nights, they have camped in parks, basketball courts, at bus stops or on the side of the road.</p>\n<p>They even strung a hammock between two broken semi-trucks one night.</p>\n<p>“And if it wasn’t the best rest I ever had,” Lee recalled.</p>\n<p>The bikers will admit that the most challenging part of the journey has been the biking itself; pedaling up rocky mountains for hours on end in extreme heat with bicycles that weigh about 140 pounds can take a toll.</p>\n<p>Both agreed the exercise has been as much a mental exertion as a physical one. Often, they ride on freeways with trucks whizzing past them, with a clamor of honking horns in the background.</p>\n<p>Lee once faced off with a bull in the middle of the road, remembering that its horn came within inches of his handlebars.</p>\n<p>He describes biking in these situations as a “mental game” that’s better than “any meditation [he’s] experienced ever before.”</p>\n<p>Connell said one of the best parts of the trip has been “breaking that social stigma” that people have about countries that are often portrayed in the media as dangerous.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_81110\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1796918267\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"81085\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-81110\" data-attachment-id=\"81110\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-alumni-cycle-from-i-v-to-nicaragua-and-beyond/img_2784/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1365\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IMG_2784\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?fit=888%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81110\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=888%2C592\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_2784.jpeg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-81110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The bikers stayed in Belize for two weeks after a local man invited them to stay with him and his family in their home. <em>Courtesy of Daniel Connell</em></p></div>\n<p>Connell and Lee said they planned to go to an island in Belize for one day and ended up staying for two weeks after a man invited them to stay with him and his family.</p>\n<p>“It was something special because he lived on a separate island, and his daily commute from one island to the next was via his homemade sailboat that he made purely out of materials that he found on the beach where he lives,” Connell said.</p>\n<p>They both agreed that Honduras has been their favorite country to visit so far, but only after some hesitation.</p>\n<p>“That’s a hard question!” they exclaimed in unison.

Connell and Lee’s goal of $5,000 would be enough money to donate 30 bikes to people around the world.

Despite the long journey they’ve already had, they aren’t tired — anyone could hear it through the excitement in their voices.</p>\n<p>In fact, the travel mementos they have packed keeps growing, adding more weight to their bags, although they would say it’s worth it.</p>\n<p>They currently are carrying a guitar, ukulele, multiple books, fins to help them swim, cooking supplies and even a backgammon set, Connell said.</p>\n<p>“We <em>had</em> a backgammon set,” Lee reminded his friend.</p>\n<p>“Okay, we <em>had</em> a backgammon set,” Connell conceded. “We recently lost that and it’s quite heartbreaking.”</p>\n<p>Yet it doesn’t seem to be the objects that have made this trip so worthwhile for Connell and Lee. Instead, it’s been the knowledge gained along the way, the change in their worldview and the strengthening of their own friendship.</p>\n<p>“After four years at UCSB, me and Quince, to put it in funny terms, were homies,” Connell chuckled. “We would hang out, but we never actually traveled together, and to go from that to sleeping within a foot of each other ― we’re like a married couple.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps at the end of the day, it comes down to a love of biking and a friendship that started at UCSB. One thing is for sure: Connell and Lee don’t seem to be braking anytime soon ― they are already planning their next trip, maybe biking through the Middle East, including Iraq and Iran, or from Colombia to Patagonia at “the end of the world.”</p>\n<p>They have a few rides ahead of them to figure it out.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this story appeared on pg. 1 of the Feb. 15, 2018 issue of the

As the names and ages of those who died in the mudslides were read aloud, community members quietly shed tears with the pain of losing a friend, neighbor or family member.</p>\n<p>At least 20 people lost their life in the mudslides that occurred early Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Benitez: 10 years old<br>\nKailly Benitez: 3 years old<br>\nJoseph Francis Bleckel: 87 years old<br>\nMartin Cabrera-Munoz: 48 years old<br>\nDavid Cantin: 49 years old<br>\nMorgan Corey: 25 years old<br>\nSawyer Corey: 12 years old<br>\nPeter Fleurat: 73 years old<br>\nJosephine Gower: 69 years old<br>\nJohn McManigal: 61 years old<br>\nAlice Mitchell: 78 years old<br>\nJames Mitchell: 89 years old<br>\nCaroline Montgomery: 22 years old<br>\nMark Montgomery: 54 years old<br>\nMarilyn Ramos: 27 years old<br>\nRebecca Riskin: 61 years old<br>\nRoy Rohter: 84 years old<br>\nPinit Sutthithepa: 30 years old<br>\nPeerawat Sutthithepa: 6 years old<br>\nRichard Loring Taylor: 79 years old</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80384\" style=\"width: 2058px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/vigil-at-sunken-gardens-3-2/\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80384\" data-attachment-id=\"80384\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-15/santa-barbara-community-mourns-lives-lost-in-montecito-mudslides/vigil-at-sunken-gardens-3-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1251&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1251\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Vigil at Sunken Gardens-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?fit=250%2C153&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?fit=888%2C543&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80384\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=888%2C542\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"542\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=250%2C153&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C626&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vigil-at-Sunken-Gardens-3-1.jpg?w=1776 1776w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-80384\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Local elected and community leaders organized the event and offered words of hope to attendees, many of whom knew people who were lost in the mudslides. <em>Courtesy photo</em></p></div>\n<p>Local elected and community leaders organized the vigil, including First District Supervisor Das Williams, County Board of Supervisors Chair Joan Hartmann, State Senator Hannah Beth Jackson and Congressman Salud Carbajal.</p>\n<p>Members of the Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist faiths also came to support the community in its grief.

class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The project to repair El Centro began in January after the university notified students that the building was no longer safe due to dry rot, insect damage, steel beam corrosion and an inadequate amount of ventilation beneath the trailer’s floor.</p>\n<p>The project cost approximately $900,000, according to UC Santa Barbara spokesperson Andrea Estrada. Student Affairs contributed $100,000, and the university allocated the remaining $800,000 through the deferred maintenance program.</p>\n<p>University officials originally told students to evacuate El Centro within 45 days, saying the building would either be demolished or improved within that time period. The alarming notice provoked outcry from student groups that use the historical space.</p>\n<p>The university intended to complete the project over the summer, but plumbing complications and changes with university officials overseeing the project slowed the project’s process, said Lorena Alvarez, a fourth-year English major and member of the El Centro Committee.</p>\n<p>“I guess they didn’t realize how many structural issues the building had,” Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>El Centro serves as a gathering space for various cultural organizations, including El Congreso, M.U.J.E.R. de UCSB, Students for Justice in Palestine and conglomerate Mesa Directiva.</p>\n<p>The building is located in two combined industrial trailers and was initially designed to last 10 years, according to campus architects. The building has long outlasted its lifespan, and cultural groups that have occupied the space since the 1970s demand a permanent foundation for its walls.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the building repairs were slow at the start of the summer due to plumbing complications and when a project manager went on vacation, but progress sped up when Alvarez returned to UCSB in August.</p>\n<p>“Over the summer, you would have seen nothing being done to El Centro, and when I came back in August, you started seeing weekly changes,” she said.</p>\n<p>Former campus architect Marc Fisher, who was one of the lead contributors to the project, left UCSB over the summer to take a job at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the El Centro Committee worked with Fisher until he left and has since communicated with Renee Bahl, associate vice chancellor for Design, Facilities and Safety Services, about the repairs.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee was designed to monitor the building repairs and keep an open line of communication between students and administrators. The group meets weekly to discuss the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t architects,” Alvarez said. “We want to make sure we understand what’s happening as students.”</p>\n<p>After a seismic stabilization project that began in February, the university added 12 concrete pillars around the north and east sides of the building.</p>\n<p>These structures made the building more durable and resilient to earthquakes, campus architect Ed Schmittgen told the <em>Nexus</em> in April, and the university opted to repair the building instead of demolish it.</p>\n<p>Some student organizations have been able to use various parts of the building throughout the reconstruction.</p>\n<p>In October, El Congreso was permitted to use the second floor of the building once again, after being unable to use it for the first few weeks of Fall Quarter, Alvarez said.</p>\n<p>Two rooms were also available for students to use as study spaces, and two full time Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) counselors and cultural mentors began using the space to hold office hours.</p>\n<p>The El Centro Committee also received $9,000 from the Associated Students Senate in October to purchase a security system for the building.</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the system will have card readers and make it easier for students to access the building more frequently, even when other student groups are not holding office hours or using the building.</p>\n<p>“We had an issue with students being not being able to get into El Centro because it was locked,” Alvarez said. “Getting the card reader … would be a safer way for them to navigate through the building and get access to the building.”</p>\n<p>Alvarez said the university has been transparent about its work on the building’s progress.</p>\n<p>“I’m really thankful that they’re allowing us to be a part of these conversations and ask for things when we need clarifications,” Alvarez said. “They’ve been really helpful in that sense.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.3 of the Nov. 30 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/after-repairs-el-centro-will-be-ready-for-use-by-january/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/after-repairs-el-centro-will-be-ready-for-use-by-january/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/after-repairs-el-centro-will-be-ready-for-use-by-january/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/after-repairs-el-centro-will-be-ready-for-use-by-january/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-30/after-repairs-el-centro-will-be-ready-for-use-by-january/","id":2741,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[2740,2739,2738],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Records Show Years of Resident Complaints Against I.V.

Morton said Gelb may have been the victim, witness, involved in the incident or the suspect in the four other investigations.</p>\n<p>According to Kelly Hoover, spokesperson for the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s office (SBSO), Gelb has never been arrested by SBSO.</p>\n<p>Sgt. Rob Romero from the UC Police Department said UCPD has not received any formal complaints about Gelb.</p>\n<p>Lt. Ruben Cintron, spokesperson for the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), also said no formal complaints have been filed against Gelb.</p>\n<p>SBPD is currently investigating Gelb on charges of disturbing the peace after he was filmed yelling homophobic slurs at I.V. Community Services District President Ethan Bertrand.</p>\n<p>The <i>Nexus</i> contacted nine rental companies and two independent landlords for comment on Gelb and Del Playa Rentals’ business practices and their working relationships with him.</p>\n<p>Gelb was filmed yelling profanities and homophobic slurs at Bertrand at approximately 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 7. A friend of Bertrand’s filmed the incident.</p>\n<p>In the video, Bertrand confronted Gelb about the landlord’s decision to sell all of his 37 properties in I.V. and said he did not treat his tenants well.</p>\n<p>Gelb became upset and began to follow Bertrand down the 500 block of State Street, shouting homophobic slurs at Bertrand, who is openly gay.</p>\n<p>Morton said the incident on Tuesday was the police department’s fifth contact with Gelb for anything other than traffic violations or parking tickets.</p>\n<p>While this incident prompted the police’s first investigation of Gelb, I.V. residents have complained about Gelb and Del Playa Rentals for years.</p>\n<p>Ellis Dane Andersen, a former UC Santa Barbara student, said while he lived at one of Gelb’s residences, he often heard Gelb say homophobic and racist slurs to his friends and housemates.</p>\n<p>One day, Andersen said, Gelb began yelling homophobic slurs at Andersen’s friend, who was openly gay. The neighbors called the police due to the disturbance, Andersen said.</p>\n<p>Andersen said law enforcement did not take statements from the residents.</p>\n<p>Lt. Cintron could not comment on this event, but said in an email that IVFP has responded to calls that “do not rise to the level of a crime and could be considered a civil matter or an incident.”</p>\n<p>Robin Unander, lawyer for the Legal Resource Center in I.V., said she has received “consistent complaints” about Del Playa Rentals from tenants over the past 14 years of working at the Legal Resource Center.</p>\n<p>Unander said she has addressed complaints about issues including security deposits, maintenance problems at a residence and transfer of leases. She said tenants do not directly complain about Gelb’s treatment of students in the majority of complaints.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes they come in with concerns specifically about him and how he engages his tenants and how he interacts with them, but rarely do they come in complaining just about that,” Unander said. “Usually there’s something else going on.”</p>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) has been notified of complaints about Gelb and privacy concerns, as well as complaints about Gelb’s behavior towards students, by the Legal Resource Center, according to Daniel Renteria, IVTU chair and fourth-year political science and communication double major.</p>\n<p>Anderson lived at a Del Playa Rentals residence from 2013 to 2014. He said while living at the residence, Gelb would oftentimes walk into the house without warning.</p>\n<p>“He had a key for our house and he would just break in and inspect,” Andersen said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_79643\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-79643\" data-attachment-id=\"79643\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-11/isla-vista-landlord-yells-homophobic-slurs-at-i-v-csd-president-on-state-street/gelbattack/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?fit=1665%2C889&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1665,889\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"gelb picture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?fit=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?fit=888%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-79643\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack-1024x547.jpg?resize=888%2C474\" alt=\"\" width=\"888\" height=\"474\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?resize=1024%2C547&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?resize=250%2C133&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?resize=768%2C410&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gelbattack.jpg?w=1665&amp;ssl=1 1665w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-79643\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>James Gelb, owner of Del Playa Rentals in I.V., began yelling profanities and homophobic slurs at Ethan Bertrand, president of the I.V. Community Services District at around 8 p.m. on a sidewalk on State Street.</em></p></div>\n<p>Renteria said IVTU has received privacy complaints about other landlords as well, not only Gelb. He said the union has prioritized making tenants more aware of their right to privacy so landlords cannot abuse their power.</p>\n<p>IVTU will host a town hall next Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Community Room of the I.V. Neighborhood Clinic at 970 Embarcadero del Mar to discuss how tenants and landlords can settle disputes.</p>\n<p>Many tenants have questioned why Gelb’s behavior has persisted for so long, but Unander said Gelb’s actions have not violated housing practices.</p>\n<p>“When he makes decisions about who he’s going to rent to, so far he hasn’t engaged in any discriminatory conduct,” Unander said. “He hasn’t refused to rent to people who are part of a protected class. He rents to everybody.”</p>\n<p>The protected class is a group of people with common characteristics that are legally protected from discrimination under U.S. law, including race, gender, age and citizenship.</p>\n<p>Renteria said IVTU does not have a working relationship with Gelb, and said Gelb does not attend the Community Housing Office’s quarterly meetings.</p>\n<p>About 75 to 100 I.V. landlords and property owners attend the meeting, Renteria said.</p>\n<p>“Gelb just never goes to those meetings,” he said. “I think that if given the opportunity, if he were to play an active role in the community with all these other property providers and other landlords, that could create a relationship.”</p>\n<p>According to Jenn Birchim, the Community Housing Office’s program manager, the Community Housing Office has worked with Janette McWeeney, Del Playa Rentals property manager, but never directly with Gelb.</p>\n<p>“It’s better to have a relationship with somebody than nobody,” Birchim said.</p>\n<p>Birchim said McWeeney worked with the university in January, when a bluff collapsed at 6653 Del Playa Drive, one of Gelb’s properties. The collapse left 28 residents without secure housing.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Abboud, a graduate student and general manager of the I.V. Community Services District, lived at one of Gelb’s properties on the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive during the 2013 to 2014 school year.</p>\n<p>“It was extremely negative dealing with James Gelb, and his staff who were all extremely unpleasant people,” Abboud said.</p>\n<p>Abboud said he was the main point of contact in communicating with Gelb while living at the residence. He said the texts he received from Gelb were always “abrasive and unnecessarily aggressive.”</p>\n<p>Despite their negative experiences, both Andersen and Abboud said they never contacted the IVTU, Legal Resource Center or the police about Gelb’s behavior.</p>\n<p>“We figured if we wanted to live on Del Playa, we had to deal with Gelb,” Andersen said. “It’s not surprising to anyone, everyone just expects it out of him.”</p>\n<p>“It seemed futile to deal with Gelb,” Abboud added. “Gelb has a strong monopoly and has no reason to change.”</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on p.1 of the Nov. 16 print edition of the </em>Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-79765\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/records-show-years-of-resident-complaints-against-i-v-landlord/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-79765\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/records-show-years-of-resident-complaints-against-i-v-landlord/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/records-show-years-of-resident-complaints-against-i-v-landlord/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/records-show-years-of-resident-complaints-against-i-v-landlord/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2017-11-16/records-show-years-of-resident-complaints-against-i-v-landlord/","id":4368,"author":{"id":84,"name":"Maura Fox"},"related":[4367,4366,4365],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":5,"route":"/authors/84"}},"__N_SSG":true}
