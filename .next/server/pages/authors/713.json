Though Bon Iver hinted at an inclination toward auto-tuned vocals and suggestions of computer-generated tunes in their sophomore, self-titled album, I’m not sure anyone expected such a jarring electro-folk hybrid in the band’s recently released third album, <em>22, A Million</em>.</p>\n<p>The first song, “22, (OVER S∞∞N),” resembles more of hodgepodge of eclectic sounds than an introductory track. There’s a recurring, single-note, synthy feedback noise, some melancholy-yet-jazzy sax and a healthy serving of interestingly affected voice samples. Though not necessarily unpleasant, it is clear from the strangely formatted title and arguably even stranger sounds that the band is trying to shock listeners. The band is possibly even trying to indoctrinate us into an almost experimentally electronic and noisy album, not for those who know the band only by “Skinny Love.” Though they’re listed nearly everywhere as an “indie folk” group, I’d describe this stage of Bon Iver’s career more along the lines of “if Phil Collins went in a really weird direction after leaving Genesis.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>And, indeed, it does seem very ’80s-inspired, which is something a few fans will be expecting given the group’s prior work. This is not a decade that brings folk music to mind, but, as I’ve mentioned, neither is this album. Aside from retro bass and techno touches, the record is often reminiscent of EDM with its heavy doses of electric drums, static-y beats and what I call “bass farts.” A few times, I expected Kanye to jump in with a verse.</p>\n<p>Tracks like “715 – CRΣΣKS” and “29 #Strafford APTS” are more like the band’s well-known tunes in their almost gospel-like, building harmonies. Still, these vocals masquerade behind a proverbial shitload of Auto-Tune and are really just a chewed-up bone thrown to curmudgeonly fans like me who prefer the rainy-day vibes from old jams like “Holocene” and “Blood Bank.”</p>\n<p>Though the album is not particularly consistent with its two predecessors, it is consistent among itself. The music itself sounds interstitial, never quite resolved, while the lyrics reflect this with tales of waiting and searching. With autumn finally showing its colors (figuratively here in Santa Barbara), I was hoping for a more traditional set of songs from Bon Iver to listen to while wallowing in self-pity in the midst of midterms and romanticizing the fleeting rainy weather. That is not what I got, and, in all honesty, I will probably never listen to this album again. I encourage you to test the waters of this new style yourself, but if you need me, I’ll be listening to “Re: Stacks” on loop pretending <em>22, A Million </em>never happened.</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"attachment_72936\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"883125479\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72936\" data-attachment-id=\"72936\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/solange_cover-1475240092-1000x1000/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?fit=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1000,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"solange_cover-1475240092-1000×1000\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-72936\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Saint / Columbia\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solange_Cover-1475240092-1000x1000.jpg?resize=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72936\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Saint / Columbia</p></div>\n<p><em>A Seat at the Table</em> by Molly Guillermo</p>\n<p>Solange Knowles’s <em>A Seat at the Table </em>is a declarative demonstration of black excellence in music. The 21-track R&amp;B album, which Solange wrote, arranged and co-produced, is part memoir and part evaluation of racial politics in America, as well as a celebratory expression of black identity.</p>\n<p><em>A Seat at the Table </em>contains remarkably smooth beats produced by Raphael Saadiq and spoken-word interludes performed by rapper Master P, but it also produces a strong thematic progression of Solange’s search for self-empowerment. The album celebrates blackness in a world that doesn’t always allow people of color the space to do so. The first track and first song written for the album, “Rise,” describes the healing process Knowles has been through in writing the album. Tracks such as “Weary,” “Cranes in the Sky” and “Mad” express the anger, grief and dissonance black women experience as a result of racism and prejudice. The burden of educating others is too often placed unfairly on people of color, who then find themselves tirelessly justifying their right to be angry. The R&amp;B singer criticizes the stereotype of the “angry black woman,” a term often used to invalidate women’s anger, in “Mad.” The track describes the songstress’s attempts to suppress her pain. In “Cranes in the Sky,” the singer grieves, “I tried to drink it away/I ran around in circles/but that just made me sadder.”</p>\n<p>The singer wrote on Instagram, “When I first started writing this record I was tired, filled with grief, and feeling broken … I wanted to tell my story, our story, in my own words, and in my own voice.” In “Don’t Touch My Hair,” Solange refuses to compromise her beliefs or her identity to satisfy others. She sets boundaries by telling white people who fetishize and alienate black women by non-consensually touching their hair to back off.</p>\n<p>The progression of the album continues. “Where do we go from here?” she asks in “Where Do We Go.” Master P answers this question in “Interlude: For Us By Us”: “If you don’t understand my record, you don’t understand me, so this is not for you.’” The interlude inspires Solange to begin to create a space for herself by allowing herself to rest. In “Borderline (An Ode to Self Care)”, she sings, “Baby, it’s war outside these walls/A safe place tonight/Let’s play it safe tonight.” Artists Nia Andrews and Kia Rowland go on to sing an acapella interlude, “I Got So Much Magic, You Can Have It,” that celebrates blackness. “Don’t let anybody steal your magic” is the defining rhetoric, both of this interlude and Solange’s journey.</p>\n<p>The album ends with a spoken-word interlude by Master P called “Closing: The Chosen Ones.” The final lyric, “Now, we come here as slaves, but we going out as royalty, and able to show that we are truly the chosen ones,” evokes regality. Solange has not only endured personal suffering, but identifies also with the suffering of all black people in America. At the conclusion of her journey, she recognizes herself and other people of color as the “chosen ones,” who deserve to be honored for their strength.</p>\n<p>Solange has created a beautiful and deeply personal album, rife with classic instrumentation and jazzy R&amp;B beats defined by her strong and clear voice. <em>A Seat at the Table</em> is black excellence and black affirmation at its finest.</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"attachment_72937\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"193810748\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72937\" data-attachment-id=\"72937\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?fit=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?fit=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-72937\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Warp\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/danny-brown-atrocity-exhibition.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Warp</p></div>\n<p><em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> by Ryan Hikes</p>\n<p>In a recent interview with <em>Complex</em>, Danny Brown said that his artistic vision for his music is to “paint my own path and do something nobody else did because originality is everything to me.” Brown accomplishes this goal with his new full-length studio album <em>Atrocity Exhibition, </em>tackling the otherworldly, experimental beats all over this record that very few other rappers would even attempt to rap over.</p>\n<p>Lyrically, Brown returns to the more personal content of his breakout 2011 album <em>XXX</em> centered on his mental problems and drug use. However, <em>Atrocity Exhibition </em>does not simply celebrate drugs and partying, nor does it wholly condemn it. Instead, it portrays a person experiencing the highs and the lows of life. For example, the song “Get Hi,” which features a comedic hook by B-Real, seems at first to be an innocuous weed anthem. However, in the context of the album it amounts only to a temporary high, which may only lead to worsening depression akin to the “Downward Spiral” described in the first track. This song features unsettling guitars and industrial percussion that bring to life its hazy, eerie lyrics as Brown describes a depressive episode where he “feel like no one care, so I isolate myself and don’t go nowhere.” He then tries to quell this depression by “drowning [his] frustrations in an ocean of sin.” This is the tension of the album, as Brown seeks to relieve his pain, even though he knows it’s only pushing him further down this “Spiral.”</p>\n<p>This tension is realized in the instrumentals, as some of the best bangers of the year share a track list with some of the most soul-bearing raps since Kendrick Lamar’s <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>. Incidentally, Kendrick features in one of the lead singles of the album, the posse cut “Really Doe,” along with Ab-Soul and Earl Sweatshirt. One of the highlights of the album, all four verses bring the energetic flow that makes a great posse cut, and it’s hard to pick a favorite feature, though Black Milk brings an excellent beat in his one production credit. Paul White, who is coming off a successful collaboration with Open Mike Eagle this year, remains on top of his game with a production credit on ten songs. A key standout from White is the sixth track, “Ain’t It Funny,” which features looping samples a muddy driving bass reminiscent of Grime music with high hornlike synths that create a creepy, funhouse beat. However, despite the exciting bangers of the album, the looming shadow of Brown’s depression remains in the background before being addressed with force on the final cut “Hell for It,” in which Brown reasserts control of his life by promising to keep fighting for his art despite his other problems. Ultimately, <em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> does something quite remarkable among today’s hip-hop releases and remains cohesive in content, while tackling a variety of instrumentals that keep you interested throughout the 46-minute runtime of the record.</p>\n<p>Overall, this album is the perfect mix of unique artistry in the hip-hop medium: everything from the dark personal lyrics that present the highs and lows of a strained mental state to the eerie, experimental beats that seem to mesh perfectly with Brown’s unique yelping vocal delivery. <em>Atrocity Exhibition</em> is the realization of Danny Brown’s desire to create something absolutely original and is one of the best hip-hop releases of the year.</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"attachment_72938\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2101037434\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"72932\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72938\" data-attachment-id=\"72938\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/banks/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?fit=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?fit=888%2C888&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-72938\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks-250x250.jpg?resize=250%2C250\" alt=\"Courtesy of Harvest\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/banks.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-72938\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Harvest</p></div>\n<p><em>The Altar</em> by Malei Guzman</p>\n<p>Two years after the release of her debut album, singer-songwriter Jillian Rose Banks, better known as BANKS, released her sophomore album titled <em>The Altar.</em> The album was released at midnight on Sept. 30 2016. In this album BANKS experiments with her sound plenty, but also defines who she really is and who she wants to become as an artist.</p>\n<p>She starts the album off with an indie pop sound, and as it progresses it transitions into a much slower, alternative R&amp;B sound. The album touches many subjects, but the main theme that appears often is self-love and breakups.</p>\n<p>The song “To the Hilt” is a piano ballad about how hard it is to go through a breakup. It’s deep, it’s sad, it’s beautiful. Honestly,  listen to this song when you’re having feels.</p>\n<p>Her lead single, “Fuck with Myself,” is an anthem for everybody. It shows the beauty of loving yourself. BANKS herself has mentioned that this song can be interpreted in many ways. It has multiple meanings like, “I’m freaking awesome and I love myself,” or, “I don’t need anyone but myself!” It leaves one with the strong impression of, “I love myself because I am an awesome person, and if I’m the only one that can see that, it’s okay!”</p>\n<p>The song “Weaker Girl” also shows the strength within that comes with learning self-love. It’s a much slower song than “Fuck with Myself,” but it definitely shares the same message. The song explains the importance of loving yourself and surrounding yourself around people just like you. Being around people who share similar goals, interests and mindsets is a lot more important than one may think. The song is about a toxic relationship in which her boyfriend did not appreciate her for her greatness. He saw her as a toy; she was weak, and that gave him power. In the song she explains that she is not weak. She does not need someone who keeps brining her down; all she needs is herself and someone just as badass as her.</p>\n<p>In the song “Mother Earth,” we can hear the rawness of her voice. It’s soothing and it has a lot of true and powerful emotion to it. The song uses just a guitar for the instrumentals rather than her usual electronic, rap-inspired beats, which makes it great. We can hear her actual voice shine through, not one that is overpowered by the beat.</p>\n<p>Even though <em>The Altar</em> has a sound very similar to BANKS’s debut album <em>Goddess,</em> her sound on this album shows the improvement she has made with her voice. It shows how comfortable she has gotten over the years with her unique style of music.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-72932\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-72932\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-10-06/artsweek-co-review-the-hottest-new-records/","id":6725,"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy"},"related":[6724,6723,6722],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UMO Stops at SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_0256.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_0256.jpg?resize=795%2C529&ssl=1","description":"The band may be off to Indio for the weekend, but, as frontman Ruban Nielson said, “Man, fuck Coachella.

Before the Coachella-bound band made their appearance, however, Vinyl Williams got the crowd warmed up.</p>\n<p>Rewind to 9 p.m. Four men grace the tangle of wires that is the stage, each markedly different in appearance. For those like myself who had never heard of openers Vinyl Williams before, it was immediately clear that their sound would be hard to gauge from their presence. A bassist with sleek hair, a sweatshirt and wing-tipped boots; a goateed and Hawaiian shirt-wearing drummer; a keyboardist/guitarist decked out in a fine black blazer; and a front man sporting a tribal coat and a curly mane concealing the bulk of his expression offered little in the way of my musical style predictions. Once the hodgepodge of musicians got started, however, it was clear that they were a perfect warm-up to UMO. The L.A.-based group’s Tame-Impala-esque, affected sounds and eerie harmonies grounded by deep bass started the evening off right with psychedelic and celestial vibes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“Your eyes are twinkling and you’re all purple,” Lionel Williams, the band’s front man, said through his curtain of curls. “You’re like little raspberries.”</p>\n<p>Though there was something to be said for SOhO’s lighting techs, who unfailingly matched the setting to the psychedelia in the music, the crowd was just about done with Vinyl Williams’ “transcendental pop” and antsy for some UMO.</p>\n<p>Literal drum warlock Riley Geare was the first to brave the stage to assemble his set amid screams of anticipation. Soon after, bassist Jacob Portrait, keyboardist Quincy McCrary and front man Ruban Nielson joined their percussionist for a quick tune-up … or was it even a tuning session at all? Even their sound check sounded like nonchalant yet expert off-the-cuff jamming, transitioning seamlessly into opening song “Like Acid Rain.” By the time they were throwing their second song back to “From The Sun” off of 2013 record <em>II</em>, it was clear that even the band was surprised at the noise and overall hype emanating from the modest crowd that SOhO allowed. Nielson’s half smirk stuck throughout the band’s mid-song jam as body parts groped at him from the crowd and concertgoers took deep, arm-waving bows in his direction. When the singer’s mic failed during “How Can You Luv Me,” a girl literally climbed on top of me to catch the attention of the closest person of authority — who just so happened to be bassist Portrait — to make sure we wouldn’t be without his voice for too long. “We know,” mouthed Portrait consolingly, but it hardly mattered. Though Nielson’s vocals were back in a flash, the devoted audience was doing a perfectly good job of filling in the blanks.</p>\n<p>“Man, fuck Coachella. This is the show right here,” Nielson said after a particularly funky and particularly crowd-wooing rendition of “The World Is Crowded.”</p>\n<p>It really was no wonder that showgoers were worshipping the man, what with the front man’s signature third-eye tattoo peeking out of the collar of his baggy garb with every twist, turn, dip or unclassifiable dance move during the many mind-blowing solos and musical improvisations. These intra-song jams are what make a UMO show. The talent of each individual band member is remarkable, but, somehow, they come together to form something greater than the sum of their parts. One second, the crowd is singing the familiar guitar riff of “So Good at Being in Trouble” and the next, McCrary has transported us to a jazz cafe with the simple tap of a few keys.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, the highlight of the show was marked by the reintroduction of Vinyl Williams’ guitarist/keyboardist. It wasn’t so much that we missed the opener’s musical stylings, but more so that this meant Nielson was free to roam the crowd with just a mic as he sang “Stage or Screen.” In that moment, selfies were taken, tears were shed, lives were changed. It’s quite possible that my soul left my body when I brushed Nielson’s shoulder.</p>\n<p>In any case, the manhandled and shaken but happy-looking singer made it back to the stage to close with “Multi-Love.”</p>\n<p>“This song is too real,” yelled someone who was either close to tears or had simply tired out their voice so much from screaming that it cracked mid-sentence.</p>\n<p>Of course, what’s a show without an encore? Unknown Mortal Orchestra didn’t keep us waiting too long for two hits from their most recent album. They saved single “Can’t Keep Checking My Phone” for last, which got everyone dancing in sync, making me seriously consider the soundness of SOhO’s infrastructure and causing me to fear for my life to an extent. In the end, we came out alive, certainly more alive than we had come in.</p>\n<p>After the show, McCrary mozied out to the dying crowd to chat up some fans, myself among them. Though the keyboardist didn’t have much to say about their Coachella performance to come the next day, he was happy to share his thoughts on Santa Barbara. According to McCrary, UMO has been playing in Santa Barbara since 2002 and has always recognized it as a hub of enthusiastic fans.</p>\n<p>“The energy here is always amazing,” McCrary said.</p>\n<p>That’s certainly something we can agree on. While I’m sure Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s Coachella performances will be just as good musically, I don’t envy festival-goers. A SOhO packed to the rafters with devoted fans fostered an intimate and excited energy, the likes of which simply couldn’t be matched anywhere else.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-70186\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/umo-stops-at-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-70186\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/umo-stops-at-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/umo-stops-at-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/umo-stops-at-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-21/umo-stops-at-soho/","id":6756,"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy"},"related":[6755,6754,6753],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UMO Coming to SOhO","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?resize=658%2C438&ssl=1","description":"Psych-rock set Unknown Mortal Orchestra to warm up for their Coachella act right here in SB.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_69440\" style=\"width: 668px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-69440\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"375272114\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"69439\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69440\" data-attachment-id=\"69440\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/e2f8750d/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?fit=658%2C438&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"658,438\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"e2f8750d\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?fit=658%2C438&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69440\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?resize=658%2C438\" alt=\"Courtesy of pitchfork.com\" width=\"658\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/e2f8750d.jpg?resize=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69440\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Courtesy of pitchfork.com</em></p></div>\n<p>In 2010, a mysterious, hip new track was floating around the ether, gaining acclaim from popular and respected music bloggers. After some time trying to track down the creator of this delectable new flavor of lo-fi rock, singer and guitarist Ruban Nielson finally laid claim to it under the name Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Thus, with “Ffunny Ffrends,” UMO was born. Fueled by this pre-prepared hipster blog following, the New Zealand/Portland-based group hit the ground running, releasing a self-titled album in 2011 that gained acclaim from Pitchfork Media for its unique lo-fi garage rock sound with just the right touch of psychedelia.</p>\n<p>With the recent success of their third album, <em>Multi-Love</em>, it is no surprise that Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s upcoming show at SOhO has been sold out for weeks. You may know UMO from last summer’s Outside Lands lineup, though you may not have seen them given Mac DeMarco’s conflicting show time. Be this the case, I sincerely hope you’ve claimed your SOhO ticket, because an Unknown Mortal Orchestra performance is so grungy yet perfectly executed that it turns passive music listeners into connoisseurs and brings connoisseurs to tears.</p>\n<p>Drawing inspiration from classic jazz and hip-hop artists like Chet Baker and MF Doom, UMO’s vintage sound peppered with affected guitar and hypnotic bass lines is the stuff of underground rock dreams. Though their recordings are testament to this, it is impossible to comprehend the depth of talent each musician in the band possesses individually without witnessing one of their seven-minute intra-song jams during a live show. So, calling all lo-fi fanatics, all garage rock enthusiasts and all psychedelic devotees; this April 14, 9 p.m. show is the one for you.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-69439\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-69439\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-04-05/umo-coming-to-soho/","id":6690,"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy"},"related":[6689,6688,6687],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"13 Reasons Why Santa Sucks","category":"Nexustentialism","subcategory":"Nexustentialism","publish_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/santa5.gif?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/santa5.gif?resize=650%2C366&ssl=1","description":"Despite what his name suggests, old Saint Nick is no saint.

Many feared the group’s sound and stage presence would suffer on tour, myself included. After a life-changing show at the Santa Barbara Bowl last Saturday, however, my worries were quelled. Kintsugi itself is a Japanese art form involving mending broken pottery with metallic lacquer, aiming to add to the beauty and history of the pottery rather than cover up the breakage. How appropriate a title for their tour, as Death Cab was able to take something broken and make something stunning with their new assembly.</p>\n<p>As the light faded over the hills, a vintage voice sample played the band in, battling with the screams of fans. Buttoned up in all black, the band opened with “No Room In Frame,” and the crowd went wild. The rest of the show continued much the same, with a focus on newer releases, although the boys did throw it all the way back to their second album. Despite two new touring members, Death Cab’s sound was better than ever, my only complaint being that the mixing could have been better on a few songs. Other than that, it was as near to perfection as I could have imagined. Even the chemistry between frontman Ben Gibbard and newbie touring guitarist Dave Depper seemed like that of old friends. Gibbard even shared stories of their adventures exploring the Santa Barbara hills together that morning.</p>\n<p>“We saw this little pool of water and we decided it would be a good idea to go swimming … we soon realized this was not good water. It wasn’t like doo-doo water, but it was not good water,” Gibbard said. “We think we might get some sort of superhuman powers … it’s kinda played out, the whole superhero thing … we’ll be taking suggestions at the merch desk for how to use our powers.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although this got plenty of laughs, Gibbard and the band were able to set a multitude of tones throughout the show. These are certainly seasoned performers who know the art of creating a set list, and the emotional fluidity of the show was absolutely seamless. The group perfectly manipulated the mood of the show throughout the night, easing the crowd in and out of their more melancholy tunes, but making sure each song showcased a different style than the last.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, the emotional height of the show was the heart-aching ballad, “What Sarah Said.” Just a few taps of the keys in, the crowd recognized the tune and let out a collective “aaahhhhhh.” Looking around, couples everywhere were having moments. For lonely, single-entry press pass me, the performance yielded a sigh and a “… damn …” at my fellow lonely reporters in the press section. From there, the mood stayed low and cathartic with long-time top song, “I Will Follow You Into The Dark.” Gibbard took the center of a dark stage with a single, soft spotlight on himself and his acoustic guitar. Throughout the song, the crowd remained silent, apart from a single “OH MY GOOOODDDDDD” which, although quite a juxtaposition to the apparent mood, yielded laughter and shouts of agreement from the audience before growing quiet again. As Gibbard crooned the lingering note before the final chorus, a shooting star flew radiant over the bowl. Sounds of joy and disbelief overcame the crowd as showgoers pointed heavenward. Sorry, everyone not at this show, but your life will never be as magical as that moment. You can’t make this shit up.</p>\n<p>But even more so than the sound, the lighting was truly entrancing — with each song came an entirely new setting. A celestial backdrop granted the feeling of sitting on the moon, the stage lighting alluding to tendrils of Starbursts reaching off into the vast cosmos as the group performed “Black Sun.”  The image of television-static provided a satisfying contrast when the opening riff to “The Ghosts of Beverly Drive” cut cleanly into it. An ethereal green animation gave the illusion of a ghost floating above the performers during “You’ve Haunted Me All My Life.” With a consistently symphonic, yet always unique balance of piano, drums, bass, guitar and synth, it is easy to be drawn into Death Cab songs, but with this lighting, the audience was drawn into another world.</p>\n<p>Die-hard Cabbie or not, this show was undeniably magical. I’m a broke college student with no car, but after a show like that, I’m thinking a trip to Seattle to see their final shows is totally doable.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pq-yP7mb8UE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64934\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/death-cab-and-best-coast-kick-off-santa-barbara-bowl-fall-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64934\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/death-cab-and-best-coast-kick-off-santa-barbara-bowl-fall-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/death-cab-and-best-coast-kick-off-santa-barbara-bowl-fall-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/death-cab-and-best-coast-kick-off-santa-barbara-bowl-fall-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-01/death-cab-and-best-coast-kick-off-santa-barbara-bowl-fall-season/","id":6921,"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy"},"related":[6920,6919,6918],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Death Cab is Sure to Kill","category":"Artsweek","subcategory":"Music","publish_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/deathcabforcutiepress.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/deathcabforcutiepress.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Death Cab for Cutie, savior of the indie-rock world, has done it yet again with 2015 release Kintsugi, and has been celebrating with a world tour.

On Sept. 26, the band famous for “Soul Meets Body” and “I Will Follow You Into The Dark” will grace our own Santa Barbara Bowl along with beach-rock duo Best Coast.</p>\n<p>Originally founded by four Bellingham, Washington men in 1997, Death Cab boasts a long career on the indie/alternative scene with plenty of success. Over the years, the boys have produced eight full-length albums and two EPs, racked up five Grammy nominations, streamed the world’s first live, one-shot music video, earned <em>Billboard</em> gold and platinum certifications, been featured on movie and television soundtracks, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. The list goes on and on and, needless to say, this is a group of seasoned musicians.</p>\n<p>Likely, the show will feature much of the material from their latest album, but I predict some of their old hits will make the setlist as well. It wouldn’t be a show for bassist Nick Harmer without bass-centric fan favorite “I Will Possess Your Heart,” and I’ll be damned if frontman Ben Gibbard doesn’t end the show pleading “I need you so much closer” from their <em>Transatlanticism</em> title track, hopefully with some pyrotechnics involved (lookin’ at you, SB Bowl … make the magic happen).</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Recently, however, the group has become smaller. Chris Walla, guitarist and producer, announced that he would be leaving the band after <em>Kintsugi</em> was finished. Thus, Death Cab will be touring with remaining three original members Gibbard (vocals/guitar/piano), Harmer (bass) and Jason McGerr (drums) along with new recruits exclusively for tour, Dave Depper (guitar/keyboards) and Zac Rae (keyboards/guitar). Although Cabbies everywhere — myself among them — find themselves wondering why anyone would leave a band that created such impeccable angsty anthems, tear-inducing ballads and all-around lyrical and musical genius, I am sure we are all excited to see what the threesome can do without Walla, nonetheless.</p>\n<p>As for the show-openers, Best Coast is sure to set the stage well for Death Cab. Although their lyrics lack in intellectuality, especially in comparison to Gibbard’s poetic verses, the band’s beachy sound will be no stranger to a Santa Barbara crowd. The two-piece consisting of songwriter, guitarist and vocalist Bethany Cosentino and guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Bobb Bruno is famous for their upbeat California-centric songs with just a hint of haunted distortion. Although not a huge fan of Best Coast due to my inability to overlook the distractingly shallow lyrics, the band holds a special place in my heart seeing as Cosentino is the only famous musician to have come out of my high school choir. Personal preferences aside, the pair is sure to hype up the crowd with hits like “Boyfriend,” “The Only Place” and “Our Deal.”</p>\n<p>If you find yourself wanting to escape the crowded and surely alcohol-drenched streets of Isla Vista that first weekend back, snag a seat at the Bowl for what’s sure to be the alternative rock experience of a lifetime. After all, a band whose first release was a cassette tape and yet who continues to be relevant among music-lovers of all ages in 2015 has got to have some serious talent.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"888\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/srvcc8izHSU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-64751\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-64751\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/death-cab-is-sure-to-kill/","id":6909,"author":{"id":713,"name":"Simone Dupuy"},"related":[6908,6907,6906],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/713"}},"__N_SSG":true}
