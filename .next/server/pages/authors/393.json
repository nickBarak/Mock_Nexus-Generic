Yet Mr. Banuelos believes that Trump’s candidacy united the country. If the protests across the nation over the past week have not disabused him of that notion, then perhaps he should take a hard look at what his candidate has done and said throughout the course of his campaign.</span></p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a candidate who, in his very first campaign speech,</span><a href=\"http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> declared</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that “When Mexico sends its people … They’re bringing drugs.

These are stubborn facts recorded in articles and video footage. Yet Mr. Banuelos criticizes Democrats and the media establishment as the ones who “openly decr[ied] an entire segment of the American population,” as if his candidate had not done so all on his own.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He then claims that Mr. Trump won in response to an intolerant ideology that “is quick to label political opponents rather than engage in meaningful dialogue.” He is right in that regard — except he points the finger at the wrong candidate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The author says that we should all agree that “legitimate acts of racism need to be called out and dealt with accordingly.” Perhaps he should start with all the Trump supporters who have verbally and physically assaulted women, Muslims and African-Americans after the election. Or he could start by acknowledging the support that his candidate has received from groups like the Ku Klux Klan, who are so enthusiastic about his victory that David Duke, a former grand wizard of that organization </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrDavidDuke/status/796249464826687488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boasted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, “our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But perhaps, Mr. Banuelos, you argue that grouping you together with the KKK is an inherently unfair characterization, and you would be right. After all, no group containing millions of Americans can be fairly painted with broad brushstrokes. Yet you seem so unhesitatingly willing to do the same for those who opposed Mr. Trump’s candidacy by labeling the large proportion of Americans who opposed Trump as merely “the left,” as if they were a monolithic political force devoid of the differing beliefs individuals can still have with their ideological peers. </span></p>\n<p>If we really are to unite together and put patriotism above partisanship, we ought to start by dispensing with the caricatures that have permeated our discourse.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a conservative, the author’s embrace of Trump’s candidacy on the basis of conservatism puzzles me. I believe that America is safest when we embrace a policy of what Reagan called “peace through strength,” by establishing a strong and rigorous defense and standing resolutely with our allies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trump believes that our partners in NATO are disposable, and that our support should be contingent upon how much they’ve paid us, as if we ought to play the role of the mafia demanding protection money. If Mr. Trump truly believed in “peace through strength,” he should know that NATO has helped </span><a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/nato/nato-can-remain-relevant/p28292\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preserve stability</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Europe for over half a century, and that our alliances are instrumental to our security, especially in this increasingly interconnected world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conservatism stems from the belief that the free market is the greatest economic engine in history, and when reasonably regulated, can create a rising tide that lifts all boats. Free trade facilitated Europe’s miraculous economic recovery after World War II and America’s stratospheric rise to the status of a global superpower. It has enabled those with lower incomes to have higher spending power by giving them access to cheaper products, and capitalism continues to be the economic force that lifts millions out of poverty in Africa and Asia.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span>Donald Trump represents the type of individual our Founders feared: a demagogue who appeals to our society’s worst impulses.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>This is not to say that freer trade has not come without its costs. Millions of American workers have lost manufacturing jobs because of foreign competition, and we should rightfully find ways to help them. But Donald Trump’s policies will not do that. Instead he believes he can bring jobs back to America by threatening to hike up tariffs with China and withdraw from NAFTA, stoking the very real possibility of a trade war that would</span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/19/the-effect-of-trumps-trade-policies-trade-wars-with-china-mexico-that-could-cost-u-s-4-million-jobs-report-says/\"><span> hurt</span></a><span> the very middle-class and working poor families he claims to champion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While conservatives believe in fiscal responsibility through lowering taxes and broadening the tax base, Trump instead proposes playing a game of fiscal acrobatics by favoring massive tax cuts and simultaneously promising to dramatically </span><a href=\"https://www.greatagain.gov/policy/transportation-infrastructure.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> spending. His policies would recklessly </span><a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-fiscal-guide-2016-election\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">add</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> $11.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade in a plan so incoherent it would make a volume of Tolstoy or Dostoevsky seem easily comprehensible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Banuelos ends by saying that, “Those who pretend their ‘existence’ is at risk by having a President Trump should remember he cannot do anything without the discretion of 535 members of Congress.” On this point, the author may well be right … If we discount the president’s power to veto legislation, negotiate treaties, deport illegal immigrants, detain suspected terrorists, order troops into combat, conduct drone strikes or launch nuclear warheads. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The executive branch may be checked by the powers of the legislative and the judicial, but let’s not kid ourselves about how “little” the president can do. The office carries a great burden of responsibility, one that I do not believe Donald Trump is fit to carry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m ashamed of the decision our country has made on who should be president for the next four years. I believe that we have a special obligation to be responsible stewards of this country. Donald Trump represents the type of individual our Founders feared: a demagogue who appeals to our society’s worst impulses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet on January 20th, he will become the next president of the United States, and one can only hope, against the preponderance of evidence thus far, that he truly becomes a president for all Americans. He would do well to remember what Kennedy said in his inaugural: “Civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Calvin Chiu isn’t quite ready to welcome the President-elect with open arms.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-74395\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/a-response-to-its-morning-again-in-america/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-74395\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/a-response-to-its-morning-again-in-america/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/a-response-to-its-morning-again-in-america/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/a-response-to-its-morning-again-in-america/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2016-11-22/a-response-to-its-morning-again-in-america/","id":5750,"author":{"id":393,"name":"Calvin Chiu"},"related":[5749,5748,5747],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/393"}},"__N_SSG":true}
