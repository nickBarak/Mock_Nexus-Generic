It’s cheap,” Hothi said. “They always have good sales.”</p>\n<p>Spisla said it can be difficult for I.V. residents to reach retail stores that are several miles away since the majority rely on bicycles and skateboards for transportation.</p>\n<p>“[Amazon] was looking into the proximity of other locations where the general population can actually purchase items, what kind of retail stores are in this area as well, and we found that there’s not a lot around here,” Spisla said.</p>\n<p>First-year economics and music double major Nick DiPierro, an Amazon Student member, said having the pick-up point open on weekends will be helpful.</p>\n<p>“Our post office is closed on Saturdays and Sundays and closes at four,” DiPerro said. “Sometimes I’d like to be able to order things over the weekend.”</p>\n<p>Spilsa said she hopes the new pick-up will become a part of the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“We’re excited to be the first site that’s actually off-campus, and to be able to be part of the community and build those relationships with the other businesses, meeting everyone that’s around this area, and working very closely with the students and general population that lives around here or works around here,” Spisla said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-66511\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/new-amazon-store-offers-prizes-convenience/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-66511\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/new-amazon-store-offers-prizes-convenience/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/new-amazon-store-offers-prizes-convenience/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/new-amazon-store-offers-prizes-convenience/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/new-amazon-store-offers-prizes-convenience/","id":4599,"author":{"id":148,"name":"Jacob Little"},"related":[4598,4597,4596],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Co-op Hosts Organic Potluck With Live Music","category":"News","subcategory":"Isla Vista","publish_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-1.jpg?resize=800%2C530&ssl=1","description":"The Isla Vista Food Co-op, Associated Students Food Bank and I.V.

Community Relations Committee hosted their third potluck of the quarter titled “The Grazing Hour” Friday at the I.V. Co-op patio.</p>\n<p>The Grazing Hour featured organic food provided by the three organizations and participating attendees, and UCSB alumnus Conner Cherland played solo guitar and sang for music entertainment. The first-ever potluck was held earlier this quarter in September in an effort to build connections with I.V. residents by sharing healthy food.</p>\n<p>A.S. Food Bank Coordinator Tuyen Nguyen said the purpose of the event was to help connect I.V. residents through healthy eating habits.</p>\n<p>“I think that if folks have the ability to begin to interact with their neighbors, and begin to really use and work with the other neighbors, there’s a lot of potential to really be able to capitalize on that social capital and really be able to support one another in some way or another, in genuine way of figuring out and caring for one another,” Nguyen said.</p>\n<p>The event drew a crowd of around 70 to 80 people, according to Nguyen.</p>\n<p>“We might have reached 100; I think there was a moment where it was pretty packed in here,” Nguyen said. “I think that [the Grazing Hour] has continued to grow and we hope that it continues to grow as folks are hanging out and chilling.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_66475\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"2124948698\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"66513\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-66475\" data-attachment-id=\"66475\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-11-16/co-op-hosts-organic-potluck-with-live-music/iv-food-co-op-potluck_vivian-bui-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"530,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D5100\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1447432573\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0025\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"IV Food Co Op Potluck\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?fit=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?fit=530%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-66475\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=350%2C528\" alt=\"Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus\" width=\"350\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?w=530&amp;ssl=1 530w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IV-Food-Co-Op-Potluck_Vivian-Bui-3.jpg?resize=166%2C250&amp;ssl=1 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-66475\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vivian Bui/Daily Nexus</p></div>\n<p>Nguyen said she feels it is important for the Food Bank to reach out to the community.</p>\n<p>“We have engaged in some of these other activities in the community, just to kind of begin to engage folks in sharing food differently, and build some community beyond just our pantry,” Nguyen said. “So it was important for folks in our leadership to engage in something like this.”</p>\n<p>Nguyen also said she hopes The Grazing Hour created a welcoming environment which Isla Vistans may not often experience.</p>\n<p>“As we expand … even if this creates some sense for someone who just walked by, and who now is just coming in for and seeing this event happen, and they have that sense of community for this moment and for this month, ” Nguyen said. “Even if it’s once a month that they’re a part of something, it’s important.”</p>\n<p>Fourth-year global studies major Ariana Richmond said the event connected her to other people in I.V. in a “chill” way.</p>\n<p>“It’s just a great community feel, beautiful music, and food.

id=\"caption-attachment-65754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara Arts &amp; Lectures hosted “Untamed Antarctica” Sunday with renowned climber and National Geographic explorer Mike Lebecki speaking at Campbell Hall about his 2012 expedition to Bertha’s Tower.</p>\n<p>Lebecki was the first person to climb Bertha’s Tower, naming the 2,000-foot granite spire after his grandmother who passed away before the expedition began. During the event, Lebecki presented photojournalist Cory Richards’ documentation of the expedition and recounted the details of climbing in below-freezing temperatures, traversing unusually sharp rocks and taking shelter from extreme wind.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said the expedition had an aura of excitement before it began due to the location and height of Bertha’s Tower, which looks like a sharp spike of rock.</p>\n<p>“This particular expedition felt like it would be the biggest one of our lives,” Lebecki said.<br>\nLebecki said the jutting rock looked like a foreign planet.</p>\n<p>“It’s a really alien landscape; we could have been looking at Mars,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>According to Lebecki, his team was delayed three weeks shortly after the trip began due to heavy winds ranging from 40 to 80 mph. Lebecki said when the crew finally arrived at the base of the tower, the heavy winds continued to make travel difficult.</p>\n<p>“The weather [in Antarctica], it’s raw and it’s brutal and it just beats the shit out of you,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said although the team had originally planned to travel by kite skiing, the strong winds pulled kites out of the explorers’ hands. Lebecki said the slick, wind-polished ice made hand skiing impossible, forcing the team to walk using spiked boots. The sharp rocks on Bertha’s Tower raised concerns of cut ropes if someone fell, making trust a primary requirement for the expedition, according to Lebecki.<br>\n“We were all putting our lives in somebody’s hand,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>According to Lebecki, the crew made camp and began preparing for their final push toward the peak after scaling 1,200 feet and placing anchors in the tower’s face. Lebecki led the final push to the summit.<br>\n“All of my experience for the last 20 years was for this moment,” Lebecki said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki said the panoramic views from the camera were breathtaking, but the team could only stay for twenty minutes before it was necessary for them to begin rappelling back down.</p>\n<p>Second-year economics major Matthew Edmiston said the whole expedition was difficult to imagine.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how he did it, how he got the rope up there; it was like a flying city, with him and his crew and his gear, I don’t know how he got it all up there,” Edmiston said.</p>\n<p>Lebecki’s mother Charlotte said she admires her son’s profession.</p>\n<p>“Every story is new to me and I just love hearing it and seeing it, especially the videos are just breathtaking,” Charlotte Lebecki said. “I am in awe of what he does, and I feel very fortunate to see what he sees.”</p>\n<p>First-year environmental studies major Marissa Rajczi said it was inspiring to hear about Lebecki’s experiences, having recently experienced the difficulty of climbing.</p>\n<p>“It was especially exciting to hear Mike’s first-hand account of his Antarctic expedition given that yesterday I went outdoor free climbing for the first time,” Rajczi said. “I could appreciate the mental and physical stamina it must have taken him to complete such a climb, and found myself in awe as I related my own experiences to his.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i

Sustainability and UCSB alumna Tamara “TJ” DiCaprio discussed her role in reducing Microsoft’s carbon emissions in a talk titled ‘”Carbon Neutrality IS the Bottom Line: The Development and Success of Microsoft’s Innovative Carbon-Fee Model” Wednesday evening at Bren Hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio recounted the process of convincing Microsoft executives to work toward carbon emission reduction through an internal carbon fee model, which the corporation has now used for four years. DiCaprio also discussed Microsoft’s clean energy projects in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said the carbon fee model imposes fees on business units within Microsoft Corporation according to their carbon emissions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we do, technically speaking, is we cascade the price of carbon down through the different business units and then we collect the funds in the central pot and use all those funds for environmental initiatives to reach carbon neutrality,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said the internal carbon fee model is gaining recognition in business communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was just recently, a couple weeks ago, recognized by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an article in the business section, which means it’s getting mainstream,” DiCaprio said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to DiCaprio, it was difficult to gain support from Microsoft executives when first attempting to reduce the corporation’s carbon emissions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody would come to my meetings,” DiCaprio said. “When they did come to my meetings, they would come and do emails the whole time. I couldn’t capture anyone’s attention, let alone get engagement in their brains.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said she was able to secure the support of executives when she learned to “speak their language” and focus on the relationship between carbon emissions and money, which lead to the creation of the internal carbon fee model.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started thinking: Okay, I’m in a business, I’ve got to start talking in terms of dollars,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to DiCaprio, Microsoft also funds carbon-offset projects in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are not only reducing carbon in Kenya and emerging nations, but also taking money from developing countries and getting them out to the emerging nations to develop a low carbon economy,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DiCaprio said Microsoft’s nonprofit work is “changing peoples’ lives” by helping developing countries industrialize in a sustainable ways.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are able to allow them not only to plant trees, but also go build factories and sell clothes and manufacture clothing with Puma and then recycle money back to be able to build schools and hospitals for healthcare and get fresh water for people,” DiCaprio said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First-year environmental studies major TJ Keeling said DiCaprio’s talk showed her the potential effects of an individual’s work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It brought into prospective the impact you can have on the environment, and more of the benefits that actually show when you do work,” Keeling said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Katheryn Collins said the internal carbon fee model is surprisingly simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you hear about it, it makes so much logical sense but it’s not something that I’ve seen widely done,” Collins said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Collins, corporations like Microsoft often create nonprofits to separate philanthropy from business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They do not want their projects on the side to be associated with their company,” Collins said. “I think this is a really interesting model that has captured the minds of the leadership so well.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graduate student Jessica Perkins said she was surprised by Microsoft’s work in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To economically make that kind of impact on a community like that seems so far removed from what companies are able to actually accomplish,” Perkins said.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">\n</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

AB 3 aims to make I.V. a Community Services District (CSD) governed by a board of local representatives and supported by a Utility Users Tax (UUT).</p>\n<p>Farr said it will be a “big job” to educate I.V. residents about how a CSD would affect them before they vote to approve it in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes people get voter fatigue; they’ve got this enormous ballot, all this stuff to go through so hopefully [AB 3] doesn’t get lost in that,” Farr said.</p>\n<p>Farr said she has heard concerns regarding funding for CSD administrative costs and services, and the role Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) would play in a CSD.</p>\n<p>Farr said a UUT, which taxes residents a portion of their utility bills, is a more effective method of dividing the costs of the CSD between students, long-time residents and property owners.</p>\n<p>“That was why they wanted the UUT rather than a property tax because the thought was that the tax burden is spread more evenly throughout the community that benefits, and not just on those people that own property,” said Farr. “Long-term owners are concerned that they are going to be saddled with enormous tax assessments.”</p>\n<p>According to Farr, IVRPD was intentionally excluded from the CSD planning.</p>\n<p>“The I.V. Park and Rec District did not want to be folded into the CSD and that was why we thought the governor might not sign it, because he doesn’t like creating layers,” Farr said. “So it was specifically written to exclude IVRPD … we’ve got a good thing going, we don’t want to goof it up.”</p>\n<p>Professor of economics Lanny Ebenstein said he has plans to raise funds for an Isla Vista Community Center that involve alumni and current students.</p>\n<p>“There are 190,000 alumni at UCSB and most of them have probably lived in Isla Vista,” Ebenstein said. “Only 15,000 people live here at a time, but over twenty or thirty years, 150,000 may have lived here.”</p>\n<p>According to Ebenstein, significant funds are still needed to build a community center.</p>\n<p>“$483,000 is a start, but it is not enough to do everything that should be done,” Ebenstein said. “Our goal would be to raise a million dollars … What we are trying to do is raise a million dollars more — that would be the funds that we think would be necessary to really make the community center.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-65162\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-65162\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-10-09/doreen-farr-talks-to-community-about-i-v-self-governance-i-v-community-center/","id":4630,"author":{"id":148,"name":"Jacob Little"},"related":[4629,4628,4627],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/148"}},"__N_SSG":true}
