Both my husband and I have spent a lot of time on campus and we lived in faculty housing just past I.V., near Sands, when we first moved here. So while the type of violence happening here is shocking, I know that the incredible community response is not.</p>\n<p>It will take time to heal, and I have no doubt that we will. But we must not forget. </p>\n<p>I have heard the frustration in the voices of those who grieve like Richard Martinez, father to Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, as he remembered his son and called for action. Far too often have we, as a nation, seen tragedy, but little changes to prevent it in the future.</p>\n<p>This tragedy has shown us the gaps. We must ensure that our mental health system and law enforcement can work together to identify potentially dangerous individuals. We must help parents who are concerned that their sons or daughters might be a danger to himself, herself or others so that they have a meaningful way to seek help. And we need systems to make sure that threats of violence flagged on social media are taken seriously.</p>\n<p>I have been in Washington this week already getting to work on some of these efforts. I was pleased that the entire California delegation joined me to lead a moment of silence on the floor of the House of Representatives on behalf of all those affected by this tragedy. Many of my colleagues have also joined my resolution in support of the I.V. community. In addition, on Friday I helped introduce a bill to start addressing ways to improve the interaction of our mental health and gun safety systems.</p>\n<p>But there is more to do. Over the next few weeks I will be meeting with local and national advocates on these issues and others to identify the gaps and weak spots in the system, and propose ways to fix them.</p>\n<p>Together we must not let Congress forget about Isla Vista or any of the number of places that have experienced this type of senseless violence.<br>\nWe must act. We must act now on sensible, responsible violence prevention legislation for our nation. Because I agree that Not One More life should be lost. Not One More family should have to grieve like this. And Not One More community should be added to this list.</p>\n<p>I will be hosting a Coffee with your Congresswoman event Thursday, June 5 from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. at Caje Coffee on Embarcadero del Norte in Isla Vista. I’d love for you to join me so that we can have a conversation about your experiences over the last couple of weeks and what you would like to see Congress doing to ensure there is #NotOneMore tragedy.</p>\n<p><em>Lois Capps is the U.S. Representative for California’s 24th congressional district.</em></p>\n<h6></h6>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared in the Thursday, June 5, 2014 print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus</em>.</h6>\n<h6>Views expressed on the Opinion page do not necessarily reflect those of the <em>Daily Nexus </em>or UCSB.

As you’re settling into your final quarter of the school year, many of you are applying for summer internships and finalizing your plans to study abroad, while others may be getting ready to graduate and start a career … and wondering how you’re going to pay off those student loans.</p>\n<p>At a time when student loan debt has surpassed credit card debt in our country, I know this is a very real concern for soon-to-be graduates. The high cost of paying back your loans can be substantial — determining the type of career you pursue or even where you’ll live. As a former student at UCSB myself and the mother of college grads, I know how daunting a challenge it can be. That’s why in 2007 I worked hard to help pass into law the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. This bipartisan law cut the interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans in half, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, over a four-year period, easing the burden on thousands of students and their families.</p>\n<p>While I had pushed for the interest-rate cut to be longer, Congress and then-President Bush compromised and set the lower rate for only a period of four years. That means these historically low rates will double — going back up to 6.8 percent on July 1 — if Congress does not act soon. This troubling increase would cost a student borrower thousands of dollars more in interest payments over the life of his or her loan.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Our country needs to be investing in higher education, not pulling back. And with tuition skyrocketing in California and in states across the country, it is more important than ever that the federal government take action to keep education affordable and within reach to all. That’s why I’m supporting legislation to keep student loan interest rates at 3.4 percent. So far, the majority party has refused to bring our bill up for a vote, but I keep pushing them. For example, last month I forced a House vote on legislation to at least allow the Department of Education to take any steps it could take to make college more affordable if Congress won’t act. Unfortunately, my legislation was defeated on a party-line vote.</p>\n<p>Lower rates on student loans are important, but I know that Pell Grants are also critical to helping thousands of Gauchos afford the ever-increasing costs of tuition and textbooks. In fact, over 15,000 students in my congressional district alone benefit from this vital federal financial assistance, and it’s one reason why I’ve continued to push for increased funding for Pell Grants.</p>\n<p>We passed legislation in 2009 to increase the maximum Pell Grant award to $5,550, and I’m urging the leadership in the House of Representatives to increase the award to $5,635. But despite the soaring costs of going to college, some actually want to cut back this vital assistance. In fact, the budget the House just passed would cut Pell Grants by more than $1,000, raising costs for the nearly 10 million students getting grants today. Needless to say, that budget did not get my vote.</p>\n<p>I know these are tough times for college students. Tuition is going up and graduates are facing a very tough job market. But for those of you who have gone the extra mile to get into college and worked so hard to graduate, I’ll do everything I can to help support you. I believe we must make investments in higher education and give you — our nation’s future leaders and innovators — the tools to compete successfully in a global economy and make a difference in your community.</p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing you on campus sometime soon. In the meantime, I hope you’ll also get in touch with me on Facebook and Twitter. My Twitter handle is @RepLoisCapps.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and Go Gauchos!</p>\n<p>Lois Capps is the representative for the 23rd District of Calif.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46155\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46155\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-17/congresswoman-capps-pledges-allegiance-student-funding/","id":6057,"author":{"id":431,"name":"Lois Capps"},"related":[6056,6055,6054],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/431"}},"__N_SSG":true}
