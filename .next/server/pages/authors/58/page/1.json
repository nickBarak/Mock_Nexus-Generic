The old Ike’s building is newer – the infrastructure and everything is better. Since [the Trigo location] doesn’t have air conditioning, our employees will feel much better at the new location.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also noted that in the winter, when it rains more often, his customers didn’t have a place to sit since the current location is limited to outdoor seating. He added that Mojo looks forward to being able to provide indoor seating at the new location.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before setting up shop on Trigo, Wang had been skeptical about the location. “When I first came here, even my employees said, ‘You made a bold move coming into this location.’ I had seen it change hands between 805 Kabob and Café International a couple times.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang cited lack of kitchen space at the current location as another important factor in the move. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The space [at the current location] is limited and people are often complaining about us not being able to keep up with their demand. So, moving into a larger space gives us more storage and cooking space to turn over that demand and give customers what they need,” he said.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wang also hopes that being closer to campus and the more popular parts of I.V. will help with business.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When I’m in I.V. I go walk around at different times of day and observe the busiest parts. Trigo is dead on the weekends, and the busiest street is Pardall and the area where Woodstock’s is. Sometimes people may feel like Mojo is such a long walk from there, but now, more people will be able to try us since we are closer.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He had also heard of people having trouble finding the current location and thinks that the newer location will make for easier access, especially because many people “know Ike’s was there.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ike’s closed abruptly in April and moved to a new location in downtown Santa Barbara. </span><a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/amidst-lawsuit-ikes-moves-to-state-street/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Issues between the sandwich shop and the property manager, Icon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including the reported presence of mold at the location, led owner Ike Shehadeh to pack up shop and move to State Street. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asked about the status of the mold, Wang said, “I did follow up with the property owner, and they said the mold situation was resolved.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A representative from Icon Property Management declined to comment on the situation.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89719\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89719\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-03/mojo-teahouse-to-move-to-former-ikes-location-on-65-seville/","id":4149,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[4148,4147,4146],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"“Power Is Found In The Community”: Santa Barbara Gathers at Vigil for Mass Shootings","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-08-13T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Texas-Ohio-Vigil_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_7.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Texas-Ohio-Vigil_Ida-Kazerani_ONLINE_7.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Over fifty members of the Santa Barbara community convened downtown last Monday evening to mourn those who were killed in the mass shootings in Dayton, El Paso and Gilroy.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the sun faded on the crowd gathered outside Casa de la Raza last Monday, daylight gave way to candlelight.

Thirty six died and nearly one hundred were injured across the three mass shootings, which all happened within the span of a week.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gathering was organized over Facebook by Armbruster-Sandoval and Amanda Pinheiro, a graduate student in the UCSB Global Studies department, less than 24 hours earlier. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marcus Lopez, a local activist and Chumash native, opened the vigil with a blessing and performed a native healing song. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attendees were invited to step forward and speak their minds. Most messages centered around community and a common humanity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I believe that power is found in the community,” one attendee said. “We must stand together as a community. It is the answer. We must demand from politicians the responsibility to act. When we get there, we’ll be back as humans together.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are no agendas here tonight other than the human agenda,” another gatherer said, alluding to the political nature of the debate that has sparked across the country in response to the three shootings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emiliano Campobello </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a UCSB alumnus, local activist, co-chair of Santa Barbara Standing Rock Coalition and co-founder of The Climate Mobilization’s Santa Barbara County chapter </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> condemned the racist motivations of the El Paso shooter who opened fire at a crowded Walmart. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shooter admitted to </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/us/el-paso-suspect-confession.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“targeting Mexicans”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and, in his manifesto, </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/us/politics/trump-mass-shootings.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wrote</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the “attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">President Donald Trump, who has </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/11/business/media/el-paso-killer-conservative-media.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">referred to the northern migration of asylum seekers from Latin America as an “invasion,”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been criticized this week for similarities between his words and those of the shooter. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The rhetoric that’s coming out of the White House right now is really disturbing,” Campobello said. “Now, are we going to have to be afraid to be brown and go to Walmart?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campobello, who is also a professional muralist, musician and descendent of the Yaqui and Huichol tribes, performed a song on the Native American flute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Music gets past the mind,” he said. “Language kind of gets stuck, even if the words have certain meanings. Music and melodies… get into the heart space. And as that space can open up, we can tap into a field of love. And that is what we really need right now.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others reflected on their hope for future action to prevent such tragedies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think hope is sometimes the only thing that we have to hold on to,” said one attendee. “But it is powerful. Because hope can lead to action. If we all put in our little piece of work, we can transform our communities, we can transform our state, we can transform our country. You each have a lot of power.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I see an awakening,” said Campobello. “People are less able to remain complacent and are being called to action because things have been so bad. That’s where I see hope.” </span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89519\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89519\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-13/power-is-found-in-the-community-santa-barbara-gathers-at-vigil-for-mass-shootings/","id":2014,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[2013,2012,2011],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Anthropology Professor Celebrates 32nd Consecutive Summer Traveling Across the World to Teach at UCSB","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2019-07-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Manasendu-Kundo_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Manasendu-Kundo_Siavash-Ghadiri_ONLINE-2.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Kundu’s first official quarter teaching at UCSB was the winter of 1988.

Kundu wrote a scathing response, and, not knowing what to do with his paper, began sending it to various professors at several American universities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To his surprise, some professors got back to him and liked what he had written. At the end of a reply, one professor even invited Kundu to apply for graduate school and study under him in the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That professor was Mattison Mines, who taught anthropology at UCSB from 1970 to 2005. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I pinched myself,” Kundu said, recalling the invitation from Mines. “He is my guru.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Kundu arrived in Santa Barbara for graduate school in 1982, he was primarily interested in the modernization of agriculture, population studies and the Green Revolution in India.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until Kundu was fully immersed in the environmental studies circles at UCSB that he began to see the darker sides of what he was studying — how human behavior and modern agriculture were negatively affecting the environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[Mankind’s] connection to environmental degradation … I had no idea until I came here. At the time, that conversation was not happening in India. Everyone was still thinking of how good the Green Revolution was, thinking they had found the solution,” Kundu said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the late 1980s, nearing the completion of his Ph.D., Kundu applied for a lecturer position in the environmental studies department and was subsequently accepted. However, he realized that he hadn’t quite considered the dilemma of whether to return to India or stay in the United States. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had no interest in leaving India permanently. My parents were there, my in-laws, my wife. But I couldn’t leave Santa Barbara either. I fell in love. It is this lifelong love with this campus, its students, its faculty members.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To resolve his problem, Kundu worked out a deal with the department to teach only a couple quarters a year, eventually transitioning to only teaching in the summer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s first official quarter teaching at UCSB was the winter of 1988. He hasn’t stopped since. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This summer marks his 32nd consecutive year of returning to Santa Barbara from India to teach both environmental studies and anthropology classes including Environmental Studies 132: Human Behavior and Global Environment and Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu’s interest in anthropology and the environment began in ninth grade after he attended a village boarding school.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There, I came to know the villagers, the farmers. I was born in a city and I had never seen a paddy field before,” Kundu said. “I noticed that these families had a different culture, and I became interested in their lives, the farmers’ lives. It made a deep impact on me.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu was one of the early scholars to approach environmental studies from an anthropological perspective, looking at how the development of human societies and cultures is affecting the environment today. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kundu wants students to understand that “our own consumption is at the root of the environmental crisis,” noting that during a flight from Japan to the U.S., he received a bottle of water from the Swiss Alps. He lamented the use of resources required to bring the water from Switzerland to Japan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“What is the purpose? Was there water scarcity in Japan? I did some research, and no, there’s no water scarcity. The airline wanted to show that they cared about us or something like that. Yet what is the impact? Unless we understand this, we will not be able to change it. Technology is only part of the solution. We need a behavioral solution as well. A change in perspective. That is my key message for students.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourth-year biological anthropology major Ana Perez, who is currently taking Anthropology 148: Ecological Anthropology with Kundu, said she appreciates the substance and methodology of Professor Kundu’s teaching.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “When he talked about being one of the first people to actually consider putting environmental studies and anthropology together… I didn’t even think of putting those two together. I hope that more people taking his classes decide to pursue environmental anthropology,” Perez said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think it’s awesome that he travels the world for this, and I wish more people had the opportunity to take his courses.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Kundu is grateful for his unique career, it is not without downsides. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you have two homes, you are always homesick,” Kundu said. While in Santa Barbara, it is hard not to miss his wife and family in India. However, he said that friends like Debjani Bhattacharya, a financial analyst at UCSB’s Earth Research Institute, help with that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Really, wherever you go outside of India, there will be an Indian diaspora. We met here 17 years ago through a group of friends,” Bhattacharya said. It just so happened that the two were born and raised in the same state in India, West Bengal, and attended the same university for their undergraduate studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When we go back to India, we visit each other’s families, and we have become family friends.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two friends, along with other colleagues, like to get together to cook traditional Indian meals and take walks on Del Playa Drive. Once, during an evening Del Playa walk, some students approached their group and asked Kundu if he was the chancellor of UCSB. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without skipping a beat, Kundu replied, “Not yet.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for what the future holds for Kundu, he welcomes more of the same. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Teaching is my religion. It’s not just my profession. If I wished, I could retire, but I’m not going to retire,” Kundu said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As long as my family will allow, as long as these two departments will allow, as long as my physical abilities are good… I will continue to teach.”</span></p>\n<p><em>Correction [7/28]: A previous version of this article said that Kundu was a full faculty member in the Department of Anthropology. Kundu works as a lecturer during summer sessions. </em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-89400\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-89400\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-27/anthropology-professor-celebrates-32nd-consecutive-summer-traveling-across-the-world-to-teach-at-ucsb/","id":2002,"author":{"id":58,"name":"Alex Bumpers"},"related":[2001,2000,1999],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":1,"highestPage":1,"route":"/authors/58"}},"__N_SSG":true}
