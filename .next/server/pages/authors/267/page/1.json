The officer then prepared to arrest him, noting that he was extremely intoxicated.</p>\n<p>As the 19-year-old man was taken into custody, he kept shouting at the arresting officer, “I’m not going to be in your fraternity!”</p>\n<p>The deputy informed the potential pledge that he was not affiliated with the greek system and arrested him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The subject seemed upset that the incident was not a joke. He was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed… in a jail, not a frat house.</p>\n<p>When Alternate States of Sobriety Collide…<br>\nFriday, Oct. 26, 2:03 a.m. – Deputies patrolling the 6700 block of Sabado Tarde Road observed a man pounding on the front door of a residence.</p>\n<p>The officer watched the subject stumble over a bike, pick it up, drop it and pick it up again, apparently intent on stealing it.</p>\n<p>A resident emerged from the house and told the man to leave the bicycle alone, asking the officer for backup.</p>\n<p>The deputy contacted the alleged thief and began questioning him. The 19-year-old subject said that he was just looking for a place to party – perhaps at some Isla Vista bicycle bash.</p>\n<p>As questioning continued, the officer asked the man for his phone number and the subject replied, “San Diego.”</p>\n<p>The deputy then asked the man for his emergency contact information and the man said, “Single.”</p>\n<p>The officer then decided that the two were having completely different conversations, as the subject seemed to be filling out a Match.com survey rather than answering the questions. The deputy arrested the man for public intoxication. The man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Trojans Never Learn…<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 27, 2:26 a.m. – On the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive, an officer walking by noticed a 20-year-old man sitting on a driveway, slumped forward with his back against a wall.</p>\n<p>The officer contacted him and noted that the man was unconscious. The deputy announced his presence and tapped the subject on shoulder three times before he spoke.</p>\n<p>Without looking at him, the man, who attends the University of Southern California, acknowledged the officer with a nod.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked the troubled Trojan if he was OK the man said, “yes,” and that he was just sleeping.</p>\n<p>When asked how much he had to drink, the wounded warrior admitted, “Quite a bit.”</p>\n<p>Forgetting to take a page from history, the man apparently got too drunk while surrounded by his enemies.</p>\n<p>The man said he thought he was in Los Angeles and did not even know how he got drunk.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked the man where his friends were, the man did not reply and instead vomited for several minutes on his hands and feet.</p>\n<p>The man was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was kept behind the fortress walls until he learned his lesson.</p>\n<p>Never Yell Your Phone Number to Strangers<br>\nSunday, Oct. 21, 2:41 a.m. – A woman was stumbling down the 6500 block of Seville Road, held up by an unknown man.</p>\n<p>An officer contacted the pair and asked the woman where she lived. The subject pointed and said, “Right there at 66 Seville.”</p>\n<p>The deputy duly noted that no such address exists in I.V., and decided to continue questioning the 19-year-old woman.</p>\n<p>When he asked the subject if she knew her companion, who was also intoxicated, she said she only knew his first name. The woman then apparently forgot how to pronounce her new friend’s name.</p>\n<p>When the deputy asked her how much she had drank, the subject replied, “I don’t know… but it was a lot.”</p>\n<p>The woman was taken to I.V. Foot Patrol office, where the deputy continued questioning her. The woman repeatedly said that her phone number was “714-c-h-a-y.”</p>\n<p>She immediately fell asleep after questioning.</p>\n<p>The woman was woken up and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail where she was housed, pending sobriety.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-15116\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-15116\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-11-14/police-blotter-20/","id":3863,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[3862,3861,3860],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-11-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem...

I’m fine. I’ve had four shots, but I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>When the officer managed to get a word in edgewise, he asked the subject where she lived and the 20-year-old woman replied, “I live a lot of places.”</p>\n<p>In his report, the officer noted as evidence of the subject’s extreme intoxication that her tan dress was disheveled and her top was open, nearly exposing her breasts.</p>\n<p>Evidently, the reporting deputy did not understand the Isla Vista Halloween dress code.</p>\n<p>The woman was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>Out of Her League<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 27, 11:04 p.m. – On the 6700 block of Trigo Road, a deputy observed a woman wearing a Washington Wizards jersey charge into a group of people and lose her balance.</p>\n<p>The woman, apparently incised over the foul, turned around and yelled at the group and continued traveling down the lane.</p>\n<p>That is, until an Isla Vista referee stopped her in her tracks. Noticing a strong odor of alcohol, an officer stopped the woman and took her out of the game.</p>\n<p>The deputy sat the woman on the curb and began questioning her, only to learn that she was 17 years old.</p>\n<p>The officer informed the player that she was too young to drink alcohol, to which she countered, “Yeah, but it is Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>The rules of the game are the same everywhere, and the deputy said he thought the Wizard had too much to drink. The subject shot back, “Yeah, but so has everyone else.”</p>\n<p>This defense did not work, and the officer asked if the woman had any friends who could help her home. The subject said she drove to I.V. with her sister, but when the officers asked where her teammate was, the woman said, “I don’t know, she walked away from me.”</p>\n<p>This was then game over for the underage Wizard, who was arrested for public intoxication and transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where she was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>I’m the Baby… Gotta Love Me<br>\nSaturday, Oct. 27, 11:28 p.m. –  Officers watched a 300 pound wearing a diaper with a pacifier in his mouth being  escorted down Camino Corto by a friend.</p>\n<p>An officer who observed the man noted that he was filthy and said it appeared that the big baby had fallen into a pile of dirt and rolled around in it.</p>\n<p>After watching the man stumble away from his friend and bounce into a parked car, a deputy stopped the duo and began questioning the 19-year-old man.</p>\n<p>The troubled toddler started whining to the deputies, repeating that he was not drunk, despite his inability to stand on his own, which the officers decided not to attribute to his infantile alter ego.</p>\n<p>The man had no identification and no money for a cab to transport him to his home downtown. The man would not tell officers how old he was  and refused to hold up the appropriate number of fingers.

He had to catch the man and force him to sit on the curb just to keep him from toppling over.</p>\n<p>During questioning, the man provided the deputy with several different partial addresses before admitting, “[I] have already been arrested so many times [I don’t] even care anymore.”</p>\n<p>As such, this made things easier for the officer, who then arrested the man for public intoxication and transported him to the Santa Barbara County Jail where he was housed pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>An Officer and a Gentleman</p>\n<p>Sunday, Oct. 21, 12:58 a.m. – An officer patrolling Camino Del Sur stopped a group of three women.

He then asked her how much alcohol she had consumed, and she said “none,” despite exhibiting several signs of intoxication.</p>\n<p>When asked what year she was born, the heartbroken honey replied, “1929.”</p>\n<p>Because the woman had no friends to look after her, the deputy decided to arrest her for her own safety.</p>\n<p>During booking, the woman repeatedly lied about her age and expressed her distaste for the IVFP officers, saying “I am 19.

Following his proud pronouncement, he tried to approach the officers to explain that he was OK, but again fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>Due to his extreme level of inebriation, the man was arrested for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>As the man was transported to the Santa Barbara County Jail, he vomited in the van before falling asleep in the puke-y puddle.</p>\n<p>You Say It’s Your Birthday<br>\nSunday, Sept. 30, 12:05 a.m. – Deputies contacted a 19-year-old man after they observed him disturbing a group of women walking down the 6500 block of Del Playa Drive.</p>\n<p>After confirming that the man did not know the women he was attempting to hit on, the officer sent him home.</p>\n<p>The deputy watched the man walk away and noticed that he had a very unsteady gait. After watching him run into a parked car, the deputy and his partner began following the suave subject.</p>\n<p>Officers had been trailing the man for approximately three minutes when they observed the man collide with yet another parked vehicle. They then decided to arrest him for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>During questioning and booking at the I.V. Foot Patrol Station, the subject revealed his name and told officers that his birthday was “100036.” The self-proclaimed 71-year-old subject then began vomiting before he passed out.</p>\n<p>The man was transported the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he woke up with a hangover and a criminal record.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-14570\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-14570\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2007-10-02/police-blotter-15/","id":3823,"author":{"id":267,"name":"Nikki Moore"},"related":[3822,3821,3820],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Police Blotter","category":"News","subcategory":"Crime","publish_date":"2007-01-17T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Why is the Rum Always Gone?\nFriday, Jan. 12, 11:30 p.m. - Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw an 18-year-old man urinating on a hedge near the sidewalk.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Why is the Rum Always Gone?<br>\nFriday, Jan. 12, 11:30 p.m. – Officers patrolling the 6600 block of Del Playa Drive saw an 18-year-old man urinating on a hedge near the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>When the deputy contacted the man, he noticed the subject had a fixed look in his eyes – silently staring as if in a trance.</p>\n<p>The officer helped the man to the curb, and placed him on the ground in a seated position while he filled out the police report for public intoxication.</p>\n<p>The mesmerized man remained mute during the process, and the deputy collected most of his information from the friend of the speechless subject.</p>\n<p>When the man stood up to be transported to the police station, a water bottle with dark liquid inside fell out of his pocket.</p>\n<p>The man ended his silent streak and told the deputy, “Hey, that’s Captain Morgan’s rum.”</p>\n<p>The officer told the man he did not care who’s liquor it was, and poured out the contents of the bottle before transporting the subject to the Santa Barbara County Jail, where he was housed, pending sobriety.</p>\n<p>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Getting Arrested<br>\nFriday, Jan. 12, 12:35 a.m. – Deputies stationed on the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde Road observed an 18-year-old man stagger into the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>The man walked right up to an oncoming car, forcing the driver to slam on his breaks and swerve to miss the subject.</p>\n<p>The deputy shinned a flashlight on the man, and ordered him to leave the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>The subject eventually staggered to the south side of the road, where he met the officer with bloodshot eyes, as well as the strong odor of alcohol and urine.</p>\n<p>The man told the officer he was trying to find a ride home, but could not remember his address.</p>\n<p>The deputy offered the man a lift, which he readily accepted.
