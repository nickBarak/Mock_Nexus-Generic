The state assemblyman co-authored a bill allowing courts to issue gun violence restraining orders. According to Williams, the bill was written to address “a gap in the law.” Kenneth Song/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>Two laws introduced by state legislators from the Santa Barbara area following last spring’s murder spree in Isla Vista, which took the lives of six UCSB students, were approved by Governor Jerry Brown this past Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The approved laws are AB 1014, which allows a judge to issue a temporary, emergency restraining order to briefly prohibit an individual’s access to firearms if they are judged to be dangerous, and SB 505, which requires local law enforcement agencies to implement written policies to encourage officers to consult the Department of Justice Automated Firearms System to determine whether a person subject to a welfare check is the registered owner of a firearm. The authors of the newly approved laws and other public officials gathered at Anisq’oyo’ Park in I.V. yesterday for a press conference on the law’s approval.</p>\n<p>State assemblyman for Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and AB 1014 co-author Das Williams stated that the governor’s approval of the gun violence restraining order is a “huge victory” that empowers law enforcement and family members to take steps to protect themselves.</p>\n<p>Williams also said in a separate press conference that he was inspired to author the bill to address a “gap in the law” that became evident following the events of May 23.</p>\n<p>“As I learned more about the details of this incident and that the family of the perpetrator of this violence had made an effort to alert law enforcement to possible danger, it became clear the system wasn’t set up, directly, to protect us as a community,” Williams said at the press conference yesterday. “In the future, it will be a tool for concerned family members, friends and law enforcement to deal with troubled individuals.”</p>\n<p>AB 1014, which goes into full effect Jan. 1, 2016, authorizes a given court to issue a maximum 21-day “gun violence restraining order” prohibiting the subject of the order from owning or having any access to firearms or ammunition. The issuance of such an order is contingent upon the court’s determination that the subject of the order poses a threat to themselves or others by having access to firearms.</p>\n<p>The law states that gun violence restraining orders can be requested by both an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer. The bill also requires an additional court hearing to be held within the 21-day period to determine whether a year-long order prohibiting firearm access should be issued. Additional year-long orders can also be issued at the court’s discretion.</p>\n<p>Williams also said in a separate interview that roommates would be able to make a request for the order because under California law anyone living with someone for a minimum of six months also qualifies as immediate family.</p>\n<p>The issuance of a gun violence restraining order would also require that the subject of the order surrender all firearms in their possession. Under current laws, sheriff’s deputies can ask the subject of a welfare check to voluntarily surrender firearms, but cannot seize weapons simply during welfare calls, according to Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office can only hold firearms if it determined there is a danger to the individual or the public.  A check the welfare call does not alone permit the Sheriff’s Office to seize weapons,” Hoover said in a prior interview.  “Depending on the circumstances, the Sheriff’s Office could hold weapons seized for a period of time up till approximately 180 days, but typically 60-to-90 days.”</p>\n<p>Williams also said he thought the “most important thing” when it comes to addressing existing gun laws is to get Congress to act.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been able to pass some very good gun laws here,” Williams said in a separate interview. “But at a national level nothing has been done. Sandy Hook, Colorado, our tragedy in Isla Vista, all of this has happened, and while it’s changed the politics of Sacramento it hasn’t changed the politics in Washington at all … so people are gonna have to get angry and demand that change.”</p>\n<p>Third-year environmental studies major Jennifer Suh and friend of Christopher Michaels-Martinez was present at yesterday’s press conference and said she believed the bill’s approval is a start to making a difference.</p>\n<p>“Even if it doesn’t make a huge dent in the problem, even if it doesn’t make a huge difference in the bigger issue, I think it’s a start,” Suh said.</p>\n<p>In late August, the families of slain UCSB students Christopher Michaels-Martinez, Veronika Weiss and Katie Cooper wrote a letter to Brown urging him to approve the legislation and emphasized that if a gun violence restraining order had been possible prior to the shooting, lives could have been saved.</p>\n<p>“Nothing we can do will bring back Christopher, but I’m confident this new law will help save lives and prevent other families from experiencing this same kind of tragedy. States around the country should be exploring this life-saving measure,” Richard Martinez said in a statement following the law’s approval.</p>\n<p>SB 505 author and State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, said the governor’s approval of SB 505 would better equip law enforcement during welfare calls.</p>\n<p>“This bill will help ensure that law enforcement agencies are using all the tools available to them to gather potentially life-saving information for themselves and others,” Jackson said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Three weeks prior to the Isla Vista shooting, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s deputies contacted assailant Elliot Rodger as a part of a welfare check at his parent’s request, but did not know he possessed any firearms and cleared the call. Under the new law, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office will now be required to develop policies to encourage officers to consult the Department of Justice’s Automated Firearms Database prior to conducting a welfare check.</p>\n<p>Welfare calls are fairly commonplace, but consulting the Automated Firearms System prior to taking a call is not standard procedure and would only occur if deputies felt the individual in question posed a threat to themselves or others, Hoover said in a prior interview.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56357\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56357\" data-attachment-id=\"56357\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-02/brown-approves-precautionary-gun-laws/legislation-doreen-farr-weiss-and-martinez_10-01-2014_kenneth-song-copy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy.jpg?fit=2760%2C1892&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2760,1892\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412172768\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"200\",\"iso\":\"320\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0005\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Legislation Doreen Farr, Weiss, and Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth Song – Copy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy.jpg?fit=250%2C171&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy.jpg?fit=888%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-large wp-image-56357\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Legislation-Doreen-Farr-Weiss-and-Martinez_10.01.2014_Kenneth-Song-Copy-1024x701.jpg?resize=888%2C608\" alt=\"Kenneth Song//Daily Nexus\" width=\"888\" height=\"608\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-56357\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenneth Song/<em>Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>This story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, October 2, 2014’s print edition of the <i>Daily Nexus.</i></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Yang announced Young’s planned departure in a recently released memo on the Office of the Chancellor website. Young oversees the Division of Student Affairs, a large administrative arm of the university that oversees various non-academic campus departments including Judicial Affairs, Student Health and the Office of Student Life, among others.</p>\n<p>In his memo to the campus, Yang expressed his “sincere appreciation” for Young’s time with the university and described Young’s relationship with university staff and students as that of an “advocate and mentor.”</p>\n<p>“He has worked closely with our students and with colleagues across the campus and UC system to foster a supportive and inclusive community,” Yang said in the memo. “Many of our alumni have returned over the years to express their gratitude for his mentorship and support.”<br>\nYoung joined the campus as the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs in 1990, previously serving as the Associate Dean of the College and University Registrar at Wesleyan University.</p>\n<p>According to Associate Dean of Students Don Lubach, who was in Student Affairs when Young was hired to run the division, UCSB has greatly benefitted from Young’s “principled and consistent” leadership qualities. According to Lubach, when Young arrived at UCSB the state was on a downward economic cycle, yet he immediately consulted with the dozens of departments to figure out how to keep service levels high while saving money.</p>\n<p>“He vowed to save as many of our jobs as possible,” Lubach said. “His creativity worked. I don’t think our Division had a single layoff because of his leadership.”</p>\n<p>Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Katya Armistead, who has worked with Young for almost 24 years, said he is “relentless” about pushing staff to continue their education and pushed Armistead to complete her doctorate degree, along with many other professionals.</p>\n<p>“Michael is a man of principle,” Armistead said, “he’s consistent, and he has a way truly listening to students and staff.”Director of Student Health Services Mary Ferris said Young’s legacy includes support for diversity, tolerance and training and professional development.</p>\n<p>“He has been such an inspiring leader for us all,” Ferris said in an email. “Many current campus staff leaders have been mentored and guided by him, so even though we will sorely miss him, he is leaving a whole new generation of Student Affairs leaders that can continue his vision.”</p>\n<p>According to Lubach, along with being well known across UC campuses as the “Mental Health Administrator,” Young has led a number of UC-wide efforts to support students who are challenged with depression, anxiety and other issues and has led an overhaul of nearly “every computer system that affects students.”</p>\n<p>“Clearly, Michael Young has left the campus in much better condition than it was in the [1990s] when he arrived,” Lubach said. “He has modernized our systems, but kept us working well with old-fashioned care and solid leadership.”</p>\n<p>Armistead said Young has taught her, the rest of her division and the university a great deal of wisdom.</p>\n<p>“Michael’s legacy includes a strong believe in professional development, freedom of speech, even though I also learned from him that just because you can say something, doesn’t mean you should, and to show up well,” Armistead said.</p>\n<p>According to Yang, a nationwide search committee will be formed to find candidates to replace Young, whose last day will be Jan. 31, 2015.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story appeared on page 1 of Thursday, September 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div

The University Committee on Educational Policy presented initial recommendations from the sexual assault task force and then discussed partnerships at UC Davis to advance food and health research.</p>\n<p>Educational Policy Committee Chair Regent Bonnie Reiss said the task force would continue its work into the next year and quickly draft a plan to implement its recommendations by July 2015.</p>\n<p>“As Regents we take very seriously our role as stewards of UC. We care about maintaining our role as the premier research institution on the planet,” Reiss said. “As important as this mission is, providing a safe environment is every bit as important, perhaps more important.”</p>\n<p>Members of the sexual assault task force included UC Senior Vice President Sheryl Vacca and fourth-year international development studies major UCLA Savannah Badalich, both of whom discussed task force goals before presenting seven overarching recommendations to the board.</p>\n<p>The recommendations included the creation of consistent a “response team model” at all campuses with separate focuses on reporting and prevention education; system-wide standard investigation and adjudication standards; a system-wide training and education plan for students, staff and faculty; community education about UC programs; creation of an independent confidential advocacy office for sexual violence on each campus; a system-wide website customized for each campus to provide students with resources regarding sexual assault; and a “standardized data set” leveraging existing sexual violence data, to report data in a consistent manner, with agreed upon definitions.</p>\n<p>Badalich said student respondents played a large role in generating some of the recommendations, especially the recommendation to establish an independent confidential advocacy office and the system-wide, campus-customized website.</p>\n<p>“Many students on campuses don’t know who to go to, who they can talk to about their assault without having to give a mandatory report,” Badalich said, speaking from personal experience. “After my assault I Googled ‘sexual assault at UCLA’ and the many different websites confused me, so one website would be very effective.”</p>\n<p>Badalich also emphasized how sexual assault prevention education and alcohol abuse education should not be “conflated” in new student orientation presentations and said that all faculty and staff should be required to participate in “survivor centered” sensitivity training.</p>\n<p>According to Reiss, the system-wide standardization of penalties and minimum responses following a guilty verdict in the university adjudication of a sexual assault case will be further assessed in Phase II of the task force’s work. Badalich also said the task force would keep itself open to additional recommendations in the work it does in Phase II.</p>\n<p>The Regents then convened the Committee on Finance and discussed the UC’s energy service programs to achieve climate neutrality in a presentation given by newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom and UCOP Vice President of Budget and Capital Resources Patrick J. Lenz.</p>\n<p>According to Brostrom, widespread efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are taking place across campuses, with each university cutting its emissions down to the same levels they were in 2000, as per University climate policy. Brostrom also said the UC is examining ways to reduce greenhouse gas output by eventually transitioning from burning natural gas to burning biomethane, with proposals on such efforts to come as early as the November Regent’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Brostrom and Lenz also overviewed the budget for the current fiscal year before discussing preliminary budget priority recommendations for the 2015-16 fiscal year. Among the preliminary recommendations for the priorities of the next fiscal year were a minimum of $120 to $130 million in mandatory costs, a minimum $195 million in high-priority costs and $50 million in “quality reinvestment” costs to increase graduate student support, reduce the student-faculty ratio and reduce faculty and staff salary gaps, among other purposes.</p>\n<p>According to a memo from UCOP to the Committee on Finance, the $120 million in mandatory costs are unavoidable costs that must be covered before other high-priority costs or initiatives can be funded. Lenz said if Governor Jerry Brown maintains his four percent increase in the UC’s general fund as part of his multi-year education funding plan — an amount of about $119 million — that revenue could “just fall short” of covering the proposed mandatory costs.</p>\n<p>Following the presentation, Regent Richard Blum said he is dissatisfied with what he described as the state’s “continuous” underfunding of the UC system.</p>\n<p>“We are now educating 78,000 more students with the same amount of money … than we did 25 years ago,” Blum said. “How do we do it? Larger class sizes, not a good thing. Greater tuitions, let buildings run down … there’s hardly a month goes by that I don’t hear about some dean or some chancellor worried about losing yet another good person because of a much better offer.”</p>\n<p>According to Blum, “corruption” in Sacramento is due to the UC’s current funding issues.</p>\n<p>“We at the University get the short stick,” Blum said. “We’re gonna turn this place into a community college if we keep going the way we are … after watching all this for all these years, I’m tired of it.”</p>\n<p>According to the slides of the Lenz presentation, between fiscal years 1990-91 and 2014-15, state funding for the UC grew 31 percent while inflation grew 80 percent. The UC also enrolled over 82,000 more students.</p>\n<p>The Regents then approved a $297 million dollar package to fund 15 capital improvement projects, mostly related to infrastructure and “seismic/life safety needs” as part of the 2015-16 budget for state capital improvements. One proposed project included $15 million in seismic work on UCSB’s Campbell Hall, subject to further review at the November Regents meeting.</p>\n<p>Prior to convening the Committee on Investments, the Regents heard from Jefferson Kuoch-Seng, a fourth-year management major at UC Merced and newly elected UCSA President who discussed the continuation of the IGNITE campaign, aiming to “dismantle the school to prison pipeline” as well as the recently announced UConsent campaign against sexual assault and sexual violence. Kuoch-Seng also spoke against tuition increases despite what he described as the UC’s “budget shortfall”.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Investments then heard a discussion item from UCOP Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Bachher on the status of the UC’s investment portfolio in the last fiscal year. According to slides presented during Bachher’s presentation, the UC’s total assets under management grew almost 15 percent in the last fiscal year, increasing $78.4 billion to some $90 billion, described as an “all-time high.” The UC’s investments, according to Bachher, are approximately 70 percent in North America, with 10 billion dollars in Asia, and five percent in “emerging markets,” with roughly half the total assets invested in the stock market and 20 percent and 30 percent in alternative assets and fixed income sources, respectively.</p>\n<p>After lengthy discussion, the Regents also approved the establishment of UC Ventures, an independent fund to pursue investments in companies that use UC research, subject to approval of the Regents with an initial amount of $250 million to get started.</p>\n<p>“Its pretty clear that there are opportunities, they have been profitable for investors and they exist within our organization,” Bachher said. “It is a new way to finance and benefit from innovation within the University of California.”</p>\n<p>Regent Blum said he thought it would be difficult to attract investors away from private companies in the Bay Area and cautioned Bachher on the proposal.</p>\n<p>“Other universities have done it but … you are entering into a long hard struggle and I would be very surprised if you come back three or four years from now and you will have made any money at all,” Blum said.</p>\n<p>The President’s Task Force on Sustainable Investing also presented recommendations to the Regents on implementing sustainable investment practices. Bachher specifically addressed the demands of the student-led Fossil Free UC Campaign.</p>\n<p>Task force member Bachher said he recognized efforts made by Fossil Free UC toward fossil fuel divestment and said that of the UC’s $90 billion dollar investment portfolio, roughly 10 percent of it is anchored in energy investments. According to Bachher, divesting from companies in the top 200 of emitters would result in a divestment of $3 billion, while cutting coal investments alone would equate to a $500 million dollar divestment.</p>\n<p>The Regents also passed a motion recommending the establishment and implementation of a framework on sustainable investment to be completed by June 2015 that integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as a core component of “portfolio optimization.” The board allocated $1 billion over five years to investment pursuits in renewable power and fuels as well as in energy efficiency, among other possibilities.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Compliance then presented to the board several discussion items on the internal auditing activities conducted at all UC locations between July and August, as well as a presentation by UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks on recent NCAA rule changes and their impact on the PAC-12 conference, of which UCLA and UC Berkeley are members.</p>\n<p>During the Thursday morning session the Regents appointed Howard Gillman as UC Irvine’s sixth chancellor following the departure of former Chancellor Michael V. Drake, who has been serving as Ohio State University’s president since June.</p>\n<p>Gillman previously served as the provost and executive vice chancellor, and was interim chancellor for the Irvine campus since January. According to Napolitano, Gilman was selected after a four month national search from a pool of some 405 prospective candidates. The board also approved a $485,000 compensation package for Gillman.</p>\n<p>Chair of the Board of Regents Bruce Varner praised Gilman’s leadership ability and dedication during the appointment.</p>\n<p>“Strong leadership is central to the excellence of each of our 10 campuses,” Varner said in a UCOP statement. “Chancellor Gillman has demonstrated he has the leadership attributes, the vision and the dedication to public service needed to move UC Irvine forward with vigor and integrity.”</p>\n<p>Gillman gave a brief address following his confirmation by the Regents. Following Gillman’s remarks, the Regents reconvened the Committee on Compensation and passed an action item to develop a policy to keep the compensation of UC chancellors competitive compared to “peer institutions.”</p>\n<p>The Regents also passed a motion to raise the pay of four UC chancellors who are among the lowest paid chancellors in the UC system, including UCSB Chancellor Henry T. Yang. The motion’s approval of increased Yang’s pay by roughly 20 percent, from $324,450 to $389,340.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal and UC Merced Chancellor Dorothy Leland also had their compensation packages raised 20 percent with the passage of the motion. A five percent increase was also given to UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox in the same motion.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Health Services was then convened and heard a discussion on the current financial status of the UCSF Medical Center and its soon-to-open Mission Bay Hospital, as well as a discussion on the needs of each campus to address student mental health. Regent William De La Pena requested further investigation of mental health needs of students across UC campuses and asked for a more detailed report to be presented at the Regent’s November meeting.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This story is a <em>Daily Nexus</em> online exclusive.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor:

<em>(Photo courtesy of bfs.ucsb.edu)</em></p></div>\n<p>Six current and former UCSB students filed federal complaints against the university last Wednesday, citing violations of the Clery Act and Title IX in the way university administration handled their sexual assault cases.</p>\n<p>The complaints allege that administration discouraged the reporting of sexual assault, did not appropriately sanction students admitting to sexually assaulting fellow students and created a hostile environment by allowing alleged assailants to remain in classes with their victims, among other violations. The complaints could result in a federal investigation of the university and steep financial penalties if Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and Federal Student Aid (FSA) officials deem such action appropriate.</p>\n<p>Colleges and universities are required to disclose information about crimes occurring on and around their campuses via the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, and Title IX is a federal statute that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity that receives federal funding. Both laws are enforced by the Department of Education.</p>\n<p>The complaints were filed with the help of End Rape on Campus (EROC), a sexual assault survivor advocacy group of current and former college students, which assisted the UCSB students in drawing together their complaints based on both Title IX and the Clery Act.</p>\n<p>According to EROC staff member Annie Clark, the Department of Education receives separate complaints pertaining to Title IX and the Clery Act. Clark also said that if the OCR finds a school in violation of Title IX they face what she described as an “all or nothing” penalty.</p>\n<p>“There’s a nuclear option of revoking all federal funding or nothing, which basically means they sit down with the school and the school promises to do better,” Clark said. “There’s no real accountability there.”</p>\n<p>For Clery Act violations, Clark said the Department of Education may levy a fine of up to $35,000 per violation.</p>\n<p><strong>Taking on the Crimmel Case</strong></p>\n<p>Lead complainant and recent UCSB graduate Myra Crimmel said her assault occurred on Sept. 8 of last year and that when she reported it to her crisis counselor at UCSB’s Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE), as well as to Judicial Affairs, naming her assailant, she was initially told the evidence presented was so severe the university had an obligation to pursue her case.</p>\n<p>According to CARE Director Jill Dunlap, CARE counselors assist those on campus impacted by sexual violence by supporting their decision whether or not to report the incident through official channels, as well as by accompanying the formation of a report and serving as a support person through subsequent processes.</p>\n<p>“CARE advocates are available to support a survivor through any reporting process,” Dunlap said in an email, “including campus judicial processes, as well as criminal law enforcement proceedings.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56091\" style=\"width: 199px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"757508921\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56090\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56091\" data-attachment-id=\"56091\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?fit=498%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"498,500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?fit=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?fit=498%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56091\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=189%2C190\" alt=\"44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd\" width=\"189\" height=\"190\" align=\"left\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?w=498&amp;ssl=1 498w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=260%2C260&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=250%2C250&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=64%2C64&amp;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/44075a51cb8e2daa4d054def9957e2fd.jpg?resize=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Campus Advocacy Resources &amp;

After the attorneys got involved however, various meetings between her alleged assailant and Judicial Affairs were canceled, allowing the accused to “stonewall” the case by delaying a decision, Crimmel said.</p>\n<p>“I expressed my need for the case to end in a timely manner, which the Code of Student Conduct promised me,” Crimmel stated in her complaint. “Instead, I was told ‘these things take time’ and that there was nothing I could do in the meantime. I was told that ‘the system is the way it is, you need to let it play out.’”</p>\n<p>At this time Crimmel said Judicial Affairs assured her in December her alleged perpetrator would be kept from enrolling in future classes with her. Yet when she began class Winter quarter, long after the promised 60 day limit for case resolution, Crimmel found her alleged assailant attending one of her classes. Mid-way through last Winter quarter, Crimmel’s alleged assailant requested a hearing with Crimmel while she said she distressed over moving forward and risking her case getting dropped completely in the event she lost.</p>\n<p>Crimmel also said a representative from Judicial Affairs and her crisis counselor at this point began discouraging her from going through with the hearing.</p>\n<p>“[The Judicial Affairs officer] also told me … ‘I don’t want you to go through it’ and ‘It is so much work on our end.’ I felt helpless because my crisis counselor was my only ally and was unfamiliar with the adjudication process,” Crimmel stated in her complaint. “[The crisis counselor] told me that during her time of employment there, she has never seen a sexual assault case result in a hearing.”</p>\n<p>Crimmel opted not to go through with the hearing.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, she said Judicial Affairs had contacted her father and informed him that Crimmel’s alleged assailant had refused to admit guilt and that neither the incident nor the sanctions would appear on the student’s transcript or criminal record.</p>\n<p>According to correspondence between Crimmel and Judicial Affairs provided by Crimmel, her case was closed March 4, 2014 and her alleged assailant was permitted to take his Winter quarter finals before withdrawing from the university until Fall 2014, after Crimmel’s graduation, where he was allowed to attend on disciplinary probation.</p>\n<p>“By refusing to accept responsibility and using his attorneys, he guaranteed that there would be no trace of what happened or why he temporarily left UCSB,” Crimmel stated in her complaint. “How will students be safe when a perpetrator can return to the campus after facing virtually no consequences other than some lost time and a quarter-long suspension?”</p>\n<p><strong>The Aftermath: Filing the Complaint</strong></p>\n<p>Director of Judicial Affairs Stephan Franklin said he could not offer comment on the complaint and that punishments for perpetrators of such cases vary considerably depending on individual circumstances.</p>\n<p>The UCSB Office of Public Affairs also released a statement that said the university takes “students’ reports of sexual assault extremely seriously” and that they offer counseling, support and advocacy resources, as well as a “comprehensive adjudication process” to those impacted by sexual assault.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_55124\" style=\"width: 352px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"524382703\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56090\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55124\" data-attachment-id=\"55124\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-05-01/doe-official-discusses-sexual-assault/lhamon-media2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?fit=1538%2C849&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1538,849\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"SLT-A57\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1398856647\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Catherine Lhamon held a media availability after her meeting with student leaders on sexual assault.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?fit=250%2C138&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?fit=888%2C490&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-55124\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21-1024x565.jpg?resize=342%2C195\" alt=\"Catherine Lhamon held a media availability after her meeting with student leaders on sexual assault.\" width=\"342\" height=\"195\" align=\"left\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=342%2C195 684w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lhamon-media21.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=342%2C195 1026w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-55124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education Catherine Lhamon met with student leaders on sexual assault this past Spring.</p></div>\n<p>According to Dunlap, CARE interacts with students based on the “empowerment model,” designed to give students more control over their options after an assault. She also said CARE program staff are currently collaborating with the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment/Title IX Compliance to develop a faculty guide for “responding to disclosures from survivors of interpersonal violence.”</p>\n<p>“It’s important that the student be in charge of their own recovery process,” Dunlap said in an email, “and CARE staff are here to support whatever decisions they make.”</p>\n<p>According to a spokesperson with the Department of Education who wished to remain anonymous, the Office for Civil Rights does not confirm the receipt of complaints and “will inform the institution, the complainant and the public as appropriate.” A staffer with the Department of Education’s San Francisco Office, who also wished to remain anonymous, said the evaluation of Title IX complaints from the time the complaint is received to the notification of complaint investigation or dismissal usually takes 30 calendar days.</p>\n<p>Kelty Kauffman, co-chair of campus sexual assault survivor advocacy group Take Back the Night, said the university must make strides to better combat sexual violence and provide sexual assault response resources that are swift, effective and accessible to students.</p>\n<p>“You can do a Judicial Affairs complaint, but right now there’s no one on campus besides Take Back the Night and CARE who tells students that that is an available option,” third-year English and Feminist Studies double major Kauffman said. “Most students have no idea that that they can even do that, and if they do know that they can do that, they don’t know where to go. They don’t know who to talk to. They don’t know anything.”</p>\n<p>According to Crimmel, the driving force motivating her to file the federal complaint is the hope that it will “ bring justice to those silenced by trauma.”</p>\n<p>“I was victimized twice, both by my perpetrator and my university, but the silver lining is that I am now more strong and resilient,” Crimmel said in her complaint. “Going forward, prompt action must be taken against perpetrators of sexual assaults, and survivors must be treated with respect. What happens in Isla Vista does not stay here. Things must change.”</p>\n<p><em>Editor-in-chief Carissa Quiambao contributed to this report.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-56090\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-56090\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-09-12/students-file-federal-complaint-alleging-ucsb-mishandled-rape-case/","id":3426,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3425,3424,3423],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Senate Passes Bill to Prevent Gun Violence, Sent to Brown","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The California State Senate unanimously passed Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s bill to prevent gun violence last Friday, and the bill now heads to Governor Jerry Brown, who must approve the bill by Se...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <div id=\"attachment_55991\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55991\" data-attachment-id=\"55991\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/jackson_ben/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben.jpg?fit=1447%2C932&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1447,932\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Database\",\"camera\":\"Canon EOS REBEL T1i\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1400962866\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"70\",\"iso\":\"400\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0125\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Jackson_Ben\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben.jpg?fit=250%2C161&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben.jpg?fit=888%2C572&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-55991 size-large\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jackson_Ben-1024x659.jpg?resize=888%2C571\" alt=\"Following the tragic shooting that took place in I.V. on May 23, the bill was introduced.

The purpose of the bill is to assure that law enforcement has adequate information when responding to welfare calls.</p></div>\n<p>The California State Senate unanimously passed Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson’s bill to prevent gun violence last Friday, and the bill now heads to Governor Jerry Brown, who must approve the bill by Sept. 30 for it to become law.</p>\n<p>The bill was introduced following the events of the May 23 Isla Vista mass shootings which killed six people, three of gunshot wounds, by SBCC student Elliot Rodger. Three weeks prior to the shooting, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s deputies contacted Rodger as part of a welfare check at his parent’s request but did not know he possessed any firearms and cleared the call. SB 505 requires law enforcement agencies across the state to develop and implement policies encouraging officers to consult the Department of Justice’s Automated Firearms System prior to conducting a welfare check.</p>\n<p>According to Jackson, the purpose of the bill is to ensure that law enforcement has adequate information at their disposal when responding to welfare calls.</p>\n<p>“This bill would help ensure that law enforcement agencies are using all the tools available to them to gather potentially life-saving information for themselves and others,” Jackson said in a statement.</p>\n<p>According to Senator Jackson’s communications director Lisa Gardiner, while welfare checks can be conducted by law enforcement for various reasons, SB 505 only applies to calls where “there is a concern the person may be in danger to themselves or others.”</p>\n<p>Welfare calls are fairly commonplace, but consulting the Automated Firearms System prior to taking a call is not standard procedure and would only occur if deputies felt the individual in question posed a threat to themselves or others, Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Kelly Hoover said. According to Hoover, deputies responding to the April 30 call for Rodger did not feel the need to consult the register based on their interaction with him at the time, and were thus unaware he possessed any firearms.</p>\n<p>Hoover also said deputies are empowered to ask individuals possessing weapons to voluntarily forfeit them during a welfare check but that responding to such calls alone does not permit the sheriff’s office to simply seize weapons.</p>\n<p>“The Sheriff’s Office can only hold firearms if it determined there is a danger to the individual or the public.  A check the welfare call does not alone permit the Sheriff’s Office to seize weapons,” Hoover said. “Depending on the circumstances, the Sheriff’s Office could hold weapons seized for a period of time up till approximately 180 days, but typically 60 to 90 days.”</p>\n<p>The Automated Firearms System will prove to be beneficial by virtue of making knowledge more accessible to law enforcement, which Amanda Wilcox of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in California said will put law enforcement “in a better position to protect their own safety” because “the more knowledge they have about what guns to expect the more they’re in a better position to protect their own safety.”</p>\n<p>“It’s an officer safety issue,” Wilcox said. “A lot of resources have gone into having the kind of database we have in California and we, including law enforcement, should be taking full advantage of that information.”</p>\n<p>The bill has received the support of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the California Police Chief’s Association. The latter group, according to Gardiner, lobbied for the bill to enable local law enforcement agencies to design policies on how law enforcement officers would consult the Automated Firearms Systems database.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 4 of Wednesday, August 27, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-55990\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-55990\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/senate-passes-bill-to-prevent-gun-violence-sent-to-brown/","id":3473,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3472,3471,3470],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UC Creates Anti-Sexual Assault Measures","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/napolitano122way-c48e8812a811823643248af8099e08df8e5f6a5e-s6-c30-e1379334859917.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/napolitano122way-c48e8812a811823643248af8099e08df8e5f6a5e-s6-c30-e1379334859917.jpg?resize=600%2C450&ssl=1","description":"University of California President Janet Napolitano announced the formation of a system-wide task force to address sexual assault and sexual violence on campus this past Friday in an effort to make th...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>University of California President Janet Napolitano announced the formation of a system-wide task force to address sexual assault and sexual violence on campus this past Friday in an effort to make the UC a national leader in combating sexual assault on university campuses.</p>\n<p>The announcement comes several months after the UC Office of the President issued an update in March to the university’s sexual assault and sexual harassment policy, made in compliance with the 2013 federal reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The task force will oversee efforts made system-wide to prevent sexual violence and will allow various UC campuses to share effective practices in regard to sexual assault prevention, response and education.</p>\n<p>According to UCOP spokesperson Dianne Klein, the formation of the task force was not mandated by the policy update, but came directly from Napolitano.</p>\n<p>“Sexual violence is a serious crime that we will never tolerate,” Napolitano said in a statement. “The mission of this new task force is to continue to review and improve our efforts to make sure the University of California employs innovative, evidence-based and consistent practices across the system.”</p>\n<p>The task force is comprised of 23 individuals from nine undergraduate campuses and UCOP, — including three UC Regents — and will meet via teleconference every two to three weeks and twice a month in person in July and September. A report regarding the task force will be presented to the Regents during the upcoming July 16-17 meeting.</p>\n<p>According to Ricardo Alcaino, Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment, while each UC campus is unique and has different needs to consider when responding to sexual assault, some standardization throughout the UC system is “still feasible.”</p>\n<p>“Having some minimum requirements around education for incoming students, ongoing education throughout a student’s time on any campus, and on-campus advocates for survivors could be some areas where campuses could be held to the same standards,” Alcaino said in an email.</p>\n<p>The task force could also create “meaningful change” if it lead to the establishment of some standardization of guidelines for sexual assault response for students, staff and faculty, according to Alcaino.</p>\n<p>“There simply cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to this work,” Alcaino said in an email, “but having resources that campuses can share and use is a reasonable goal for the Task Force.”</p>\n<p>According to Jill Dunlap, director of Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education and Women’s Center programs, UCSB’s GauchoFYI program is a good example of a practice that could be shared with other campuses via the task force.</p>\n<p>“[It] is a stellar example of collaboration among different departments, including the CARE program,” Dunlap said in an email. “We think requiring first-year and transfer students to go through comprehensive, in-person alcohol and sexual violence prevention programming within their first six weeks of school is important.”</p>\n<p>Alcaino also said the collaboration between CARE and the Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Sexual Harassment has “proven to be an effective model for the [UC] system to emulate.”</p>\n<p>Savannah Badalich, a fourth-year international development studies major at UCLA and one of two undergraduate students on the task force, said despite her excitement over the “freaking amazing” formation of the task force, more student representation is needed.</p>\n<p>“There should be more students,” Badalich said. “I was kind of hoping that there would be one [student representative] from each school … this is a student issue, there should be a student majority on that task force.”</p>\n<p>Bailey Loverin, third-year literature major and Associated Students Student Advocate General, also said there should be more student involvement with the task force.</p>\n<p>“I’m also concerned about the apparent lack of student feedback on this task force … [four] student voices is not enough here. The UC system has over 200,000 students. You can’t simplify that to [four] representatives,” Loverin said in an email. “I’d like to see at least two reps from each school, preferably representatives nominated by their student body.”</p>\n<p>In regard to the number of student voices on the task force, Klein affirmed that students are represented and said for any task force to be effective it “can’t be too large,” although she could not comment on the how the members of the task force were selected.</p>\n<p>Badalich also said she hopes the task force will recommend additional funding, particularly for mental health resources for sexual assault survivors.</p>\n<p>“What students need are resources, especially mental health resources … that is stuff that requires money,” Badalich said. “That’s sort of the factor. You can say all you want in support of a cause, but if you don’t give money towards it, it doesn’t mean crap. So we’ll see, I hope one of the recommendations will be giving funding.”</p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Wednesday, June 25, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article identified Jill Dunlap as the director of the Women’s Center for Sexual and Gender Equality.

Later this month, parties are hosting informational sessions designed to educate students on A.S. and the elections process, which differs for both parties. OPP selects candidates for their slate through an interviewing process, while DPP hosts primaries. Next week, parties and independents will be permitted to begin ‘active recruiting,’ which includes advertising party platforms, hosting public events and making selections for candidates. Elections will be held during week four of Spring Quarter.</p>\n<p>According to A.S. Elections Chair Claire Fox, students will soon begin submitting declarations of candidacy, which is when independents and slated party members announce their plans to run and attend a mandatory meeting on the elections process and associated regulations.</p>\n<p>According to Fox, independent candidates have had success in the past and running as an independent is a “good option” for students, citing current A.S. President Jonathan Abboud’s election to the office of senator as an independent candidate two years ago.</p>\n<p>Third-year sociology and black studies major Navkiran Kaur said the process for building slates is different for each party and noted that while DPP’s primary process is slower, it allows for greater student input into the selection of A.S. officers and representatives.</p>\n<p>“I believe the process for determining slates is different between the parties because each party has different values. DP Party was really created to challenge the status quo of Associated Students and allow for an open, democratic process,” Kaur said in an email. “We really believe that Associated Students should truly be associated with the students and as such, we feel the primary allows students to be directly involved. It also allows students to nominate exactly who they would like to see in office.”</p>\n<p>According to OPP senator Ali Guthy, OPP candidates are selected using an interviewing process, one which Guthy said allows party members more “one-on-one” time with candidates, allowing them to better assess students’ leadership abilities and skill sets.</p>\n<p>“OPP uses an interview process because we like to give candidates more personable, one-on-one time discuss themselves and their viewpoints; however, I believe that both processes are equally valid for creating slates,” Guthy said in an email. “That’s what is great about a two-party system – such different processes can be used, and both have been successful.”</p>\n<p>Active campaigning occurs during weeks three and four of spring quarter, with general elections held during week four on GOLD. Those seeking office will have the chance to hold tables, pass out flyers and meet with students who have questions for them on who they are and what they want to do if elected.</p>\n<p>DPP will host informational sessions Feb. 18 at the Santa Rosa Formal Lounge, Feb. 20 at the Loma Pelona Center and the Gibraltar Center in Santa Ynez, Feb. 24 at the MCC Theatre and Feb. 26 at the San Miguel Formal Lounge and the Santa Catalina Fiesta Room. There will be a last-minute info session on Feb. 27 in Girvetz, right before the DP Party primary. The most important date for DPP is the primary election, occurring Feb. 27 at Girvetz 1004, where any student can nominate any other student for a spot on the DPP’s spring ballot.</p>\n<p>OPP will be holding three informational sessions for sessions for students on Feb. 18, 19 and 20 at HSSB 1210, at Santa Catalina Espacio II and the San Nicolas Classroom, respectively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Wednesday, February 12, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53998\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53998\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-12/a-s-prepares-for-election-season-members-hold-informal-info-sessions/","id":3047,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3046,3045,3044],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Suicide Awareness, Prevention Among Local University Students","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Sixteen years ago, UCSB student Matthew DeMarco lost his 15-year-old half-brother to suicide and depression.

Two years later, his father — a successful Los Angeles businessman — contracted a life-threatening illness but ended up taking his own life before the illness could.</p>\n<p>With his life forever shaken by suicide, DeMarco has struggled as a victim of bullying and childhood schizophrenia in the months and years following his father’s death. Eventually, the thought of killing himself began creeping up on him as well, and the third-year economics major said he began having suicidal thoughts in the earliest years of his adolescence.</p>\n<p>“I was made fun of a lot. My life was just going to hell and I thought, ‘This is happening to me at 13, 14 years old. What about when I’m 28 or 35? If I can’t deal with the stress at 14, how am I going to deal with it when I’m 35?’” DeMarco said. “I just thought about killing myself.”</p>\n<p>But DeMarco’s story isn’t an isolated one. Two UCSB students committed suicide just last year alone, and UCSB Student Health reports that suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students. A 2011 report by the American College Health Association says roughly seven percent of UCSB students have reported seriously considering suicide, and 16 percent of these students said they felt so depressed that it was difficult to function.</p>\n<p>The causes behind suicide and the stories behind every life lost to it are not so simple, however. According the National Institute for Mental Health, individual suicides almost always involve a combination of factors such as social isolation, a family history of suicide, incarceration, a history of family violence or exposure to firearms during one’s upbringing.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president of research at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said 90 percent of people who die from suicide have diagnosable and treatable illness such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.</p>\n<p>“Therefore, treating these illnesses is an important part of reducing suicide, but the approach must be comprehensive,” Harkavy-Friedman said.</p>\n<p>According to Harkavy-Friedman, such an approach includes addressing the wide range of factors that influence one’s struggle with suicide, as these can include causes that are environmental or related to mental illness.</p>\n<p>“Suicide is a complex behavior that arises out of the coming together of many risk factors, both internal and in the environment,” Harkavy-Friedman said. “Each individual and members of different age groups experience different types of stressors. Nonetheless, mental illnesses in combination with other risk factors are key.”</p>\n<p>The presence of mental illness is strongly related to genetics, according to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) psychologist Janet Osimo, who said poor mental health can make one especially susceptible to suicidal tendencies.</p>\n<p>“If you have someone in the family with mental illness, then genetics can make an individual more vulnerable,” Osimo said in an email. “Vulnerability escalates relative to [both] stress in the environment and an individual’s capacity for stress.”</p>\n<p>In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control reported that suicide was the third leading cause of death among persons aged 15-24, accounting for 20 percent of all deaths annually within that age group. In light of these statistics, Dr. Victor Schwartz — medical director of Jed Foundation, a non-profit aiming to prevent suicide and promote emotional health of college students — said young people may be slightly more vulnerable to suicide due to the tendency for young people to be more impulsive. Sometimes, Schwartz added, substance abuse can also be a problematic factor in the occurrence of suicide in younger age groups.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes it is an impulsive act,” Schwartz said. “Sometimes, with younger people, they don’t really appreciate the finality of a mistake, of doing something that’s dangerous to oneself.”</p>\n<p>However, Schwartz also said being a college student could potentially lower one’s chances of committing suicide, in part due to the relative lack of firearms on college campuses and the support services offered by university health departments.</p>\n<p>“It appears that being in college might be protective or that the cohort of people who are attending college are at a slightly lower risk for suicide than non-college attenders,” Schwartz said.</p>\n<p>College students may also be better positioned for good mental health, according to Schwartz, since the experience of reaching higher education is a goal that requires a considerable amount of energy and positivity.</p>\n<p>“On the sociological front, people have suggested that being in college … you are in a better place sociologically — that you have more hopefulness, you have more connections, you have maybe more of an optimistic sense of the future.”</p>\n<p>Fortunately, according to Osimo, suicide leaves warning signs. Before carrying out a suicide, Osimo said an individual may reach out and say something to someone they know. They might talk about death, wanting to die or being in unbearable pain, and they may express feeling like a burden to others or display extreme mood swings or other changes in functioning.</p>\n<p>“One thing we tell people to look for — if they are trying to figure out if something is going on — is to see if there is a big change in behavior,” Osimo said. “If you can’t remember any of the warning signs, listen to your gut. If you think something is wrong, we don’t need you to know what’s wrong; we don’t need you to diagnose it. You don’t have to fix it: Just get them to someone who can help.”</p>\n<p>When looking out for warning signs, Harkavy-Friedman said people must keep in mind that mental health needs carry great variability amongst different groups of people, particularly for students.</p>\n<p>“At any age, it can take time for individuals to seek help and then, even when one seeks help, the path to wellness may not be direct,” Harkavy-Friedman in an email. “For students, declining grades, social withdrawal, sleep changes, aggression, irritability, impulsiveness and substance use may be red flags.”</p>\n<p>According to Debbie Fleming, senior associate dean of Student Life, while the two suicides during the last school year are “extraordinarily rare” occurrences on campus, two is far too many for one year at just one school. In response, UCSB launched the “Say Something” campaign on campus in October of 2013, a suicide prevention outreach effort encouraging students and faculty to seek help or take action if they or someone they know is struggling with thoughts of suicide.</p>\n<p>The campaign takes a two-pronged approach to addressing suicide on campus. The first is to reach out to students who are themselves struggling with suicide and encourage them to “say something” to someone and get help. Osimo said students should always seek help, even if suicide is not on the forefront of their mind, as she said statistics have shown that people “get better quicker if they come in sooner when distress occurs.”</p>\n<p>“A lot of people feel like they need to wait until something is a crisis to come in for help,” Osimo said in an email. “We are really trying to tell students that it doesn’t need to be a crisis to come in and talk to a counselor. In fact, it’s better to come in earlier. … As they say — come early and often.”</p>\n<p>Despite the adage, most people who die by suicide have not seen a mental health professional, according to Osimo. Instead, they often wait until things are too serious — maybe even fatal — because they believe they can manage the problem themselves.</p>\n<p>The second part to the “Say Something” campaign targets the bystander: Friends are encouraged to speak up on behalf of those they perceive are struggling with suicidal thoughts. They are told to take great care when approaching someone about suicidal behavior, such as not panicking and not “minimizing” the situation, according to Osimo.</p>\n<p>Also, when friends do reach out, Osimo said they should be careful of certain negative tendencies such as arguing with suicidal individuals about the benefits of living, as she said it is often too late for such reasoning to be effective.</p>\n<p>“Once somebody gets to that point, in their mind they’ve thought about every avenue. This is really a last resort for them, and they’ve already had that argument with themselves and they have had in their mind a number of failures,” Osimo said. “When you get to that point, it’s almost like you have blinders on: You can only see one solution, and that’s all that is left for you.”</p>\n<p>Gladys Koscak, a mental health specialist with CAPS, said suicide is less about wanting to die and more about seeking a cessation to one’s pain.</p>\n<p>“Most people who have attempted suicide don’t actually want to die. They just see it as their only option because they want the pain to end,” Koscak said. “So I think at that point, too, it’s so much less philosophical and moral of an issue than it is about them just really wanting to end the pain that they are feeling.”</p>\n<p>According to both Osimo and Koscak, the “Say Something” campaign has attracted positive feedback and a fair amount of support so far. About 27 Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District buses have attached a “#saysomething” hashtag or suicide prevention hotline somewhere on the bus. An Apple and Android smartphone application was also created in light of “Say Something,” with it acting as a tool to help students and faculty receive additional resources and information on suicide prevention.</p>\n<p>Despite their success, the program currently faces potential cutbacks. By Feb. 3, CAPS must collect signatures from around 4,000 undergraduate students as well as 400 graduate students in order to put an initiative on the Spring ballot allowing for the continuation of CAPS’s suicide prevention efforts. Osimo said as of Jan. 24, 1,500 signatures have been collected.</p>\n<p>As for students like DeMarco, they were fortunate enough to overcome their struggles on their own. DeMarco said in the end, he simply had to let go of suicide as an “answer” to his problems. But, he advises students who currently have suicidal thoughts to not ignore it and not be afraid to talk. He also said he believes parents play a major part in watching out for their children and should closely observe their child’s behavior.</p>\n<p>“Don’t ignore the problems — that’s the biggest issue. And if you see bullying, do your best to stop it,” DeMarco said. “Talk to them because suicide is permanent.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 3 of Wednesday, February 5, 2014’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53875\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53875\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-05/suicide-awareness-prevention-among-local-university-students/","id":3492,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3491,3490,3489],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Who’s Watching Your Keystrokes?","category":"News","subcategory":"Feature","publish_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Internet Creeping Emerges As Potential Method of Evaluating Applicants in Competitive Job Market, College Admissions","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <h3>Internet Creeping Emerges As Potential Method of Evaluating Applicants in Competitive Job Market, College Admissions</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have you Googled yourself lately? If the answer is yes, you’re probably not the only one digging up the Internet’s version of your personal history.</p>\n<p>From February 11 to March 6 of last year, a nationwide survey conducted by the employment website CareerBuilder.com found 39 percent of companies use social networking sites to research their job candidates. Meanwhile, only 11 percent of survey respondents said they do not check online profiles.</p>\n<p>The survey’s findings suggest employers use social media to look into the applicants’ personality and behavior outside their job interview, helping them gauge how well the candidate can fit in with the company culture. Examples of content examined include the positive, such as conveyence of a professional image or display of creativity, and the negative — such as posting of provocative photos, bad mouthing previous employers or even alcohol and drug use.</p>\n<p>But the ongoing trend is not a new one. In 2006, a survey by the private business network ExecuNet discovered 77 percent of corporate executives reported using social media sites to learn more about job applicants. A third of this 77 percent indicated that they found enough “digital dirt” to reject a potential candidate’s application.</p>\n<p>In light of this, Bradley Shear, a Maryland attorney who specializes in social media law, said he cautions job-seekers from posting potential harmful content on their social media pages. Shear advised Congressional Representative Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) in authoring the Social Network Online Protection Act, a bill forbidding institutions of higher education and employers from requesting access to student or applicant social network accounts. However, Shear said online content is never safe from employers’ eyes.</p>\n<p>“Candidates for employment are being searched online all of the time,” Shear said. “Searching candidates online has become part and parcel of the hiring process, and there is nothing illegal about performing an Internet search about someone applying for a job, just like it is not illegal to ask for references and/or past employers to verify information about a candidate.”</p>\n<p>But one of the difficulties that arise when employers Google names and online profiles of prospetive employees, according to Shear, is the growing prevalence of fake social media accounts. CNN reported in August 2012 that Facebook estimated there was about 83 million false Facebook accounts that year. Soon after, the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission filed a 2012 report identifying two problematic types of Facebook accounts: the “misclassified” and the “undesirable accounts” — the latter group being profiles that have violated any of Facebook’s terms of service policies.</p>\n<p>Because of this, Shear said it is difficult for an employer to know whether the online identity found is the right identity. In this case, he said it is illegal in some states for employers to request applicants to verify their online identities. States prohibiting this practice are California, Illinois, Maryland and Michigan.</p>\n<p>However, Shear said the law is not designed to protect people who abuse the freedoms inherent to the Internet.</p>\n<p>“The law is meant to protect those going out of the way to protect their own privacy and not those who are careless online,” Shear said. “If someone is being careless, that is their own problem.”</p>\n<p>Currently, many social media sites are taking a stand against the practice of employers using online profiles as a measure of one’s personal character. For example, Facebook — the largest social networking service worldwide — issued a statement in March 2012 condemning such activities.</p>\n<p>“As a user, you shouldn’t be forced to share your private information and communications just to get a job,” the statement said. “And as the friend of a user, you shouldn’t have to worry that your private information or communications will be revealed to someone you don’t know and didn’t intend to share with, just because that user is looking for a job,” according to the statement, which was authored by the company’s chief privacy officer, Eric Egan.</p>\n<p>Scrutiny of applicants’ social media profiles does not only exist for employment purposes. Kaplan Test Prep recently released a summary of its survey of college admissions officers and found that 31 percent of respondents — a bump up from 26 percent last year — said they visited an applicant’s social networking page to learn more about them. In addition, 30 percent of admissions officers polled said they found online content that negatively impacted a student’s application.</p>\n<p>In 2013, roughly 21.8 million high school graduates were expected to enroll in over 4,400 degree granting institutions in the United States, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. With more students than ever enrolling in college, the big question becomes: Shouldn’t freshmen and transfer applicants be worried?</p>\n<p>Christine Brown, Executive Director of Kaplan Test Prep’s College Prep Programs, said she believes otherwise.</p>\n<p>“Students should be aware and careful, but not worried,” Brown said. “There is no reason to say that admissions officers are doing this for any nefarious reasons. They often do searches for themselves to see what people are saying about their schools.”</p>\n<p>However, Brown said students must stay proactive about being responsible for maintaining and posting appropriate online content.</p>\n<p>“Your social media presence is something that you have a lot of control over,” Brown said. “Students need to recognize that anything and everything they post online can be fair game — fairly or unfairly.”</p>\n<p>But disquieting stories of students’ social media profiles harming them for job or school applications has prompted countless news sites to suggest students “clean up” their profiles during application season. In November 2013, the New York Times ran an article discussing an online profile situation gone wrong for a student applying to Bowdoin College in Massachusetts. The student attended an on-campus information session and later posted negative comments on Twitter about her fellow attendees. According to the article, her actions garnered criticism from Bowdoin’s Dean of Admissions, and she was denied admission to the university.</p>\n<p>Despite such stories, Brown said the actual chances of a student being looked up for the sake of admissions are not necessarily high. She said application officers probably only do so if a student’s application contains different or unique elements, whether alarming or impressive.</p>\n<p>“Generally, there needs to be a flag, something good or negative,” Brown said. “It could be anything.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, UC spokesperson Dianne Klein said the sheer number of applicants makes it unrealistic for admission officers to be browsing through online profiles on networks such as Facebook or Twitter. According to a 2013 information summary report offered through the UC Office of the President, 174,767 students applied to the UC for Fall 2013 — an increase of 8.6 percent from the number of fall applicants the year before. The report also stated these gains in admissions were being seen by all UC campuses, from Berkeley’s increase of 8.1 percent to Santa Cruz’s increase of 14.8 percent.</p>\n<p>“We do not check applicants on social media,” Klein said in an email. “We simply have too many applicants to do that.”</p>\n<p>Lisa Przekop, UCSB Director of Admissions, said reviewing social media content of applicants has never been a part of the admissions process.</p>\n<p>“It has never been done at UC Santa Barbara. The only information used in our review of an applicant is the information they provide on the UC application,” Przekop said. “We would not have need to review social media profiles.”</p>\n<p>But even when schools do opt to check students’ online profiles, applicants can protect themselves through various privacy options. Brown said applicants always have the choice to crack down on their privacy settings, or refuse to add “friends” and other connections they do not recognize.</p>\n<p>“We encourage students to be aware that their digital footprint and online persona is part of their identity,” Brown said. “Also keep in mind that college admissions officers are just that: admissions officers. They aren’t privacy experts or sleuths. They don’t have magic passwords to open your private Facebook account or Twitter feed. They are overwhelmingly judging your application on the traditional factors like your GPA and SAT or SAT score.”</p>\n<p>In the end, Brown said the choice of being careful lies with the students, saying it is their job to do the best they can in cleaning up their online footprints.</p>\n<p>“We advise students to check their digital trails and keep them clean. Search yourself on Google, Bing and other search engines and clean up anything that doesn’t put you in a positive light,” Brown said. “Be smart and think about everything you post online before you do it. The Internet has a long memory.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this story appeared on page 5 of Wednesday, January 8, 2014’s print edition of the <em>Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53445\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53445\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-01-08/whos-watching-your-keystrokes/","id":3484,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[3483,3482,3481],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":2,"route":"/authors/156"}},"__N_SSG":true}
