Zalesky detailed the incidence of MST compared to civilians and discussed stark similarities and contrasts between sexual assault in the military and in civilian life. About a dozen students, primarily interns in the CARE advocacy office, attended the lecture.</p>\n<p>According to Zalesky, there is a parallel between sexual assault at universities and within the military. According to Zaleski, one in two women and one in 12 men experience MST in the course of their service.</p>\n<p>“When you are in a Greek system or university system you have your own reporting process,” Zalesky said. “You have your own police department you have your own way of tracking sexual trauma and you have a culture in which you are kind of confined, and when we’re talking about the military, we’re talking about that in the same way.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky said the military and UC face similar difficulties in addressing sexual assault, and neither are particularly effective.</p>\n<p>“[UC system’s framework] rarely results in a conviction of the assailant and it’s also true for the military,” Zalesky said. “This university culture, it’s not that different from someone who is 18 and chooses military service, in terms of the sexual boundaries.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said the common ideas surrounding how sexual assault occurs usually do not match reality.</p>\n<p>“These are the typical assumptions we make about sexual assault: it’s a random guy in a dark alley; it’s someone we don’t know; they have a weapon,” Zalesky said. “Most often, people who are raped are raped by somebody they have a trusting relationship with — it’s a family member, it’s a boyfriend, it’s an ex-boyfriend, it’s a best friend.”</p>\n<p>According to Zalesky, this difference between the idea of a typical perpetrators and the reality of who they usually are makes reporting more difficult.</p>\n<p>“That’s why when you look at rape reports it’s so hard to get somebody to report because it wasn’t so clear. He wasn’t wearing a mask in a dark alley as a stranger with a knife right? It was your best friend who you’ve partied with for a year and a half,” Zalesky said. “The reason that we hesitate to report sexual assaults is because we’re so confused because it doesn’t match up with the construct of what we imagined.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said those in the armed forces who report are typically required to stay in service, as leave for survivors is not granted most of the time, which makes avoiding assailants virtually impossible. For this and other reasons, sexual assault survivors in the military have fewer options than their civilian counterparts, Zalesky said.</p>\n<p>“From day one this is your brother, this is your sister right? We are a military family,” Zalesky said. “Even if you want to take time off, even if you want to go see your mom, you can’t because you signed this [enlistment] contract.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky also said the number of male survivors of MST are roughly equal to the number of female survivors — just over 300,000 survivors of both genders — but males are far less likely to report than females.</p>\n<p>“Men are being brutalized as often during military service, but women come forward and it’s more socially acceptable to be a woman that’s been raped than a man that’s been raped … we have an epidemic of men who aren’t talking about their sexual assault.”</p>\n<p>Zalesky closed with a brief discussion on advocacy and how to help survivors, followed by a question and answer session with the audience. Zalesky said a more effective strategy for combating MST is not necessarily to encourage women to “not get raped” but rather encourage a culture of bystander intervention.</p>\n<p>Third-year global studies and feminist studies double major Clair Breen said student engagement in issues related to MST is important for continuing advocacy on the problem.</p>\n<p>“I think anything we can do is awesome, especially as college students,” Breen said. “Advocacy work is hard though because it’s hard to see a difference.”</p>\n<p>Breen also said her main take-away from the presentation was related to the difficulties MST survivors face in addressing their assaults.</p>\n<p>“I took away that it’s very hard to report in the military — that it’s a really prevalent issue,” Breen said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-63730\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-63730\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-05-22/talk-examines-military-university-sexual-assault/","id":2732,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2731,2730,2729],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Divestment Fails to Pass Again","category":"News","subcategory":"Campus","publish_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Senate_Hari-Patel-1.jpg?resize=600%2C338&ssl=1","description":"For the third consecutive year, the Associated Students Senate did not pass a resolution to divest from companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine, voting 13-12-1 i...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>For the third consecutive year, the Associated Students Senate did not pass a resolution to divest from companies allegedly profiting from human rights violations in Israel-Palestine, voting 13-12-1 in a private vote not to pass the resolution.</p>\n<p>During the nearly six-hour public comment period and in discussion afterward, individuals discussed the resolution in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The issue of UC divestment from companies doing business with Israel has been a mainstay of UC student politics for the last several years. Joining other major universities such as Stanford, seven UC campuses including Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Riverside, Los Angeles, San Diego and Santa Cruz, as well as the UC Student Association (UCSA), have passed resolutions urging the UC to withdraw its investments in several American companies allegedly profiting from selling arms and providing other services to Israel.</p>\n<p>UC Santa Barbara and UC Merced are the last two campuses with undergraduate governments that have not yet passed similar resolutions. In 2010, when the first such resolutions began to appear on UC campuses, UC President at the time Mark Yudof and UC Regents Chair Russell Gould and Vice Chair Sherry Lansing published <a href=\"http://www.ucop.edu/newsroom/newswire/img/15/15382853384e7a6d1bcce55.pdf\">a statement</a> maintaining that they would not bring forward a recommendation to withdraw investments from companies doing business with Israel, enforcing an earlier policy of not divesting from nations unless the United States government formally acknowledges those countries as committing genocide. However, supporters of the resolution argue passing it would serve as an important symbol of student solidarity with Palestine.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The reason why we are doing this is because in 2005 the Palestinian Civil Society sent out an international call for boycott, divestment and sanctions until the state of Israel abides by international law. – SJP member and Ph.D. candidate in the sociology department Jeremy Garza</p></blockquote>\n<p>This year’s resolution was sponsored by second-year communication major and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) member Anumita Kaur, who introduced it to Senate in the first week of Spring Quarter. This was the third attempt to pass such a resolution at UCSB, after previous versions failed two years in a row.</p>\n<p>The resolution to “divest from companies profiting from human rights violations in Israel/Palestine,” specifically names Motorola, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, Caterpillar, Boeing, General Electric and Hewlett-Packard as companies the UC has holdings in that allegedly profit from human rights violations in Israel. The resolution cites figures reported the UC Office of the President (UCOP) for its general endowment pool (GEP) from December of 2011. UCOP-generated links to the supporting documentation from 2011 provided in the resolution no longer function.</p>\n<p>According to UCOP’s <a href=\"http://www.ucop.edu/investment-office/_files/invpol/GEP_Holdings.pdf\">2012 reporting</a> of its GEP holdings, the most recent figures made available, the UC does not maintain any of its holdings in the aforementioned corporations except for Hewlett-Packard (HP) and General Electric Capital Corporation (GE Capital), the financial services unit of the General Electric conglomerate. Figures <a href=\"http://www.ucop.edu/investment-office/_files/invpol/UCRP_Holdings.pdf\">published in the same year for holdings</a> maintained by UCOP for the UC Retirement Plan (UCRP) apparatus follow nearly identical trends, with holdings in HP, GE, and GE Capital. Links provided in the resolution for UCRP figures from 2011 also no longer work.</p>\n<p>The resolution also directs the UCSB Foundation, the university’s fundraising apparatus, to divest its holdings in the aforementioned companies. According to its <a href=\"http://www.ia.ucsb.edu/ucsb-foundation/pdfs/private-giving-13-14.pdf\">2013-14 Annual Report of Private Giving</a>, the foundation received donations of undisclosed amounts on behalf of the university from almost every company mentioned in the resolution. Of the Foundation’s roughly $77 million dollar fundraising amount reached in the 2013-14 fiscal year, about $15 million came from corporations according to the report.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Garza, an SJP member and Ph.D. candidate in the sociology department, said SJP pursued passage of the resolution in response to a worldwide call for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) issued by the Palestinian Civil Society.</p>\n<p>“The reason why we are doing this is because in 2005 the Palestinian Civil Society sent out an international call for boycott, divestment and sanctions until the state of Israel abides by international law,” Garza said. “Our advocacy as SJP is a direct response to that call.”</p>\n<p>First-year physics major and SJP member Shahryar, who declined to state his last name, said after growing up in Dubai and seeing non-Western media discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he felt distressed knowing he had no choice in where his tuition money was going.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It targets the only Jewish state in the world. The BDS movement that it is founded upon is based in anti-Semitic values and rhetoric and the movement does not look for ways to make peace between two groups — it actually just detracts from that. – Student President of Hillel Sarah Tagger</p></blockquote>\n<p>“I feel uncomfortable being involved in something I really have no right to be so,” Shahryar said “When I learned how our tuition money was being spent on this issue I felt like it was something I hadn’t consented to, but its where a lot of the hard-earned money my parents had put so much time to send me here was going.”</p>\n<p>Dianne Klein, director of media relations at UCOP, stated in an email that student tuition and fees are used to “educate students as part of the university’s core budget,” but also said tuition revenues are available for short-term investing.</p>\n<p>“Tuition dollars are not spent the minute they arrive,” Klein said. “All cash positions, in keeping with sound business practices, are swept every day for investment in STIP — which stands for the Short Term Investment Pool.”</p>\n<p>The STIP is a cash investment pool established by the Board of Regents available for use in bond-type investments lasting under 13 months to all UC groups including retirement and endowments.</p>\n<p>According to the UC’s <a href=\"http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/nov13/f6attach.pdf\">2014-15 budget for current operations</a>, payouts from the UC Regents’ GEP, most of which are typically restricted for specific use by the contributing organization, are used to support a range of activities, including endowed faculty chairs, student financial aid and research.</p>\n<p>Tuition and fees, according to the budget, account for $3.52 billion in UC revenue in the 2012-2013 fiscal year and “support the University’s core operating budget and student financial aid” enterprises, which amounts to half the university’s core budget funding.</p>\n<p>“Tuition … provides general support for the University’s operating budget, including costs related to general campus and health sciences faculty and instructional support, libraries and other academic support, student services, institutional support, and operation and maintenance of plants,” the budget states. “Tuition revenue is also used to provide student financial support.”</p>\n<p>While SJP maintains the university uses tuition money for its investments, the group has not provided figures on the amount of tuition money invested in the companies named in the resolution and has not responded to requests to do so.</p>\n<p>Shahryar said because the UC Regents have the power to decide how UC tuition money is invested, that makes them a complicit third-party in human rights violations perpetrated in other parts of the world.</p>\n<p>“The UC regents are able to decide where a certain amount of money is invested into corporations and some corporations which they have invested into … propagate the human rights violations going on in Gaza and the West Bank,” Shahryar said. “It’s literally the tuition money we pay [that] is going toward these violations, through these investments, which then propagate these violations literally on the other side of the world and we need to speak up about that because otherwise we have no right to be outraged by it.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>The divestment resolution creates a framework that alienates Jewish students at UCSB, in part because it establishes a clear link to the BDS movement,” Moreh said. “Moreover, the attempt to draw parallels between Israel and South Africa under apartheid is ignorant and offensive on many levels. – A.S. Senator Michelle Moreh</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Shahryar, charges describing the BDS movement as anti-Semitic are inaccurate characterizations of the movement itself.</p>\n<p>“The fact is about the divestment movement, is that it’s critiquing the policies of the Israeli government. It in no way attacks Jewish or Israeli people specifically; it’s similar to how the American government was criticized for its Jim Crow laws,” Shahryar said. “It in no way targets a group of people; it targets an institution.”</p>\n<p>Garza said the ability to critique nation states should not be conflated with attacks on certain ethnic groups or nationalities.</p>\n<p>“We think we should always have the ability to critique nation states and governments and their policies and that should not be conflated with attacks on individual peoples,” Garza said.</p>\n<p>According to Garza the resolution is ultimately meant to have more of a symbolic impact.</p>\n<p>“We also hope that this impact is the last in a domino effect, if you will,” he said. “We also want to recognize that with this resolution passing, it’s not gonna be an immediate effect. It’s more symbolic than anything else and we also recognize that these types of campaigns take decades.”</p>\n<p>First-year financial mathematics and statistics major Alejandro Stawsky said he was opposed to the resolution due to its sole emphasis on human rights violations committed by Israel.</p>\n<p>“If the senate passes the current divestment resolution, they will not only have supported a one-sided resolution that completely ignores Palestinian violations, but they will also have given the message to the world that UCSB students support this, which I know many do not,” Stawsky said.</p>\n<p>Stawsky said the divestment resolution and the campaign associated with it invariably marginalizes the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“I believe the resolution definitely alienates the Israeli community, and through it, the Jewish community,” Stawsky said. “As a student who studied in Israel and whose family lives there, I could not help but feel attacked and singled out as I walked past the divestment wall in the Arbor.”</p>\n<p>Stawsky said both Israel and Palestine have committed human rights violations and debating about which side has done worse only exacerbates tensions.</p>\n<p>“Both sides committed inhumane actions and debating on who committed more or which side was worse only starts a cycle of hatred that will result in more violence and greater separation between peoples,” Stawsky said. “For every point made against the Israeli government there are at least two points to be made against the Palestinian government.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh said the divestment resolution’s reference to similarities between South Africa under apartheid and the state of Israel today are outlandish and unfairly target the Jewish community on campus.</p>\n<p>“The divestment resolution creates a framework that alienates Jewish students at UCSB, in part because it establishes a clear link to the BDS movement,” Moreh said. “Moreover, the attempt to draw parallels between Israel and South Africa under apartheid is ignorant and offensive on many levels.”</p>\n<p>Moreh said expressing opposition to the resolution doesn’t equate to support for denying Palestinians of basic human rights and that the resolution advocated for ending the Jewish state.</p>\n<p>“Rejecting this resolution does not mean opposing the rights of Palestinians; it means refusing to accept an agenda, promoted by this resolution; that the only way in which UCSB students can support Palestinians is by tearing down Jews and Israel, and by ultimately making the Jewish people stateless,” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>Moreh said a more productive resolution would be one that would address concerns of both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>\n<p>“In order to constructively address the hardships that both Palestinians and Israelis face, a significantly better alternative would be to write an entirely new resolution based on mutual recognition and respect,” Moreh said.</p>\n<p>Third-year anthropology and global studies double major and Student President of Hillel Sarah Tagger said the resolution seeks to “undermine the self-determination of Jewish people in the region.”</p>\n<p>“It targets the only Jewish state in the world,” Tagger said. “The BDS movement that it is founded upon is based in anti-Semitic values and rhetoric and the movement does not look for ways to make peace between two groups — it actually just detracts from that.”</p>\n<p>Tagger said evidence that divestment encourages anti-Semitism can be seen on other campuses that have passed divestment resolutions.</p>\n<p>“At UC Davis, the night after divestment was passed, the AD Phi woke up to swastikas spray-painted on their house,” she said.</p>\n<p>At a meeting on April 1, the A.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution to condemn anti-Semitism. Tagger said the anti-Semitism resolution was an important measure to take prior to the debate on the divestment resolution that had “been a long time coming.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve been working and striving towards coming up with something that we can bring up to Senate to showcase all the anti-Semitism that happens on campus that people don’t know about,” Tagger said. “I actually had a lot of people at the meeting tell me, ‘oh I didn’t realize so much anti-Semitism was occurring on campus.’”</p>\n<p>Tagger said she wants people to be more attuned to the Jewish community’s interpretation of divestment and its impact on them.</p>\n<p>“I just think it’s important for people to know that if our community sees this resolution as anti-Semitic that we should be listened to,” she said.</p>\n<p>Executive Director for Santa Barbara Hillel Rabbi Evan Goodman said there was a stark contrast between the anti-divestment camp and divestment proponents.</p>\n<p>“The premise of BDS is, one of their tenants is anti-normalization. They actively do not want to have discussions with people with a different opinion, they actively do not want to have discussions with people who support Israel’s right to exist in safe and secure boundaries as a Jewish State,” Goodman said. “We’re the opposite of that and we want to have discussions.”</p>\n<p>Goodman also said he did not believe claims from members of SJP and A.S. Senators that the divestment resolution was unrelated to Judaism.</p>\n<p>“When people say ‘Well, it’s not about being Jewish,’ it is about being Jewish and ultimately it’s so destructive to the multi-ethnic fabric of our campus communities, it’s a horrible, horrible situation and it’s not doing anyone any good on any of our campuses,” he said.</p>\n<p>Goodman said he had received numerous calls from concerned parents of Jewish students asking about the divestment resolution.</p>\n<p>“They’re hearing from their kids on campus how terribly upset they are,” Goodman said. “Many of these people are not people that have had any Israel activism before; they’re Jewish. So again this goes against anyone who says it’s not about being Jewish. From a Jewish perspective it’s absolutely about being Jewish.”</p>\n<p>Middle Eastern studies professor Adam Sabra said the conflict stems in part from the growth of nationalism in Europe over one hundred years ago. Sabra said the rise of anti-semitism in Europe alongside nationalism facilitated interest among European Jews to establish a Jewish state for themselves, with the Palestine region considered a primary option. Sabra also said the decline of the Ottoman Empire and rise of Arab nationalism in the late 19th century also facilitated interest in an Arab state in what by 1922 was the British-controlled “Mandate of Palestine.”</p>\n<p>“The conflicts between the Zionist movement and the Palestinian nationalist movement really goes back to the late 19th century, early 20th century,” Sabra said. “A key moment in this was the Balfour Declaration of 1917. Britain was at war with the Ottoman Empire and ultimately captured Palestine … and in response to request from British Jews who were supporters of the Zionist movement, the British issued a statement saying there should be a Jewish national home in Palestine, they didn’t say state.”</p>\n<p>This Balfour Declaration specifically stated the government of the United Kingdom did not wish to see inequality perpetuated in the region.</p>\n<p>“His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object,” the declaration reads. “It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”</p>\n<p>According to Sabra, tension grew between Arab communities and Jewish communities in the post-World War I international situation.</p>\n<p>“This started a situation that grew worse after the end of the war,” Sabra said. “A lot of immigration by Jews from Europe to Palestine was being pushed by flight from … persecution. At the same time, the Palestinian Arabs also were saying the possibility that they would have some kind of Arab state … this led increasingly to intercommunal tension.”</p>\n<p>Sabra also said the establishment of the state of Israel led to further tension among Arabs and Jews in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think the Palestinians had a problem with Jews as such being citizens in their state; Jews were citizens in other Arab states in much larger numbers in those days,” Sabra said. “That changed after the foundation of the state of Israel in the Arab-Israeli wars. … It wasn’t the presence of Jews that was the issue, it was the attempt to shift the demographic mix and to establish specifically a Jewish state that the Arabs felt they would have no place in this and would be second-class citizens.”</p>\n<p>Sabra said the 1948 Arab-Israeli War involved mass emigration of 90 percent, or roughly 700,000 people according to the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, of the Arab population in Palestine.</p>\n<p>“There is debate about how this actually took place, but it’s pretty clear that in some places they were actually driven out, other places they fled the fighting,” Sabra said. “The Israelis made the clear decision not to allow them to ever come back. These are the people who became the Palestinian refugees.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, according to Sabra, the Israelis granted Jews all over the world the right to come to Israel, called the right of return.</p>\n<p>“You can see this as a matter of providing Jews a last refuge, but it was also effectively a matter of demographic policy, because without the Jewish population elsewhere, they would not be able to build a Jewish state,” Sabra said. “If they allowed the Arab citizens … to return home, they also would not get a Jewish state. So Israel was founded basically on ethnic cleansing. There’s really not much doubt about that.”</p>\n<p>The A.S. resolution articulated support for a right of return for Palestinian refugees to the modern state of Israel, which Tagger said is anti-Semitic.</p>\n<p>“If they were all to return to the Jewish state it would extinguish the Jewish state as we know it and Jews would become the minority in their homeland,” Tagger said. “The right of return is as something that is part of the BDS movement [and] is in the larger framework of anti-Semitism by telling Jews they can’t be where they have historically been as an indigenous people for 3,000 years.”</p>\n<p>Modern Middle East history professor Sherene Seikaly said the Israel-Palestine conflict is primarily centered on territory.</p>\n<p>“The conflict in Israel-Palestine is a conflict over land; it isn’t a 2,000 year old conflict, it isn’t some struggle from time immemorial,” Seikaly said. “For centuries, people of multiple faiths in the Arab World and under Ottoman and before that under Islam lived and co-existed … until the 12th century, 90 percent of the world’s Jewish population lived under Arab and Muslim rule.”</p>\n<p>Seikaly also said it is only with the rise of Zionism and Arab nationalism that the categories of “Arab and Jew” become mutually exclusive, a product of “contemporary nationalism.”</p>\n<p>“I think nationalism promises everybody equality,” Seikaly said. “But the way that it promises everybody equality is that we all have to be the same in a sense … There is a way historically throughout many examples that the nation state has necessitated exclusionary and violent practices.”</p>\n<p>Seikaly said such practices occurring alongside the formation of nation-states are difficult at embracing difference.</p>\n<p>“Is it inevitable that nationalism is violent or … is there a way that one could have a nation state that wouldn’t be violent? I don’t know,” Seikaly said. “I think a process that is built on the foundation that there is some kind of natural ‘link’ between all of a certain group of people … I feel like that kind of project is going to be very difficult to be embracing difference.”</p>\n<p>Sabra said the founding of Israel was based in part off the denial of certain rights, including equal access to education and housing; to others as a matter of policy.</p>\n<p>“When they talk about founding a Jewish state, it was not to found a state necessarily that was Jewish religion-predominated, it was to found a state which was by and for Jews which offered Jews a different set of rights than offered others,” Sabra said. “It’s a policy. Israel is a Jewish state and therefore Jews have different rights than other people.”</p>\n<p>According to Sabra, adherence to such policy is not unified among all constituencies in Israel.</p>\n<p>“There’s always been this tension in Israel between more liberal tendencies that wanna say, ‘Well, okay we’re not gonna go back and reverse the conflict but at least the people who are still here should be equal citizens,’” Sabra said. “But increasingly that’s not the case anymore.”</p>\n<p>According to Sabra, the Likud Party, the current ruling party of the Israeli legislature, the Knesset, wish to pass a law defining Israel constitutionally as a Jewish state to prevent the Israeli Supreme Court from finding non-Jewish citizens are entitled to legal equality.</p>\n<p>“The direction of politics these days is away from any kind of equality … it’s an ethnocracy,” he said. “It would be like if we said, ‘Well, America is a white state and black people can live here; they shouldn’t expect to go to the same schools, they shouldn’t expect to live in the same neighborhoods, they shouldn’t expect equality in the courts. We don’t owe that to them.’”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-62527\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-62527\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2015-04-16/divestment-fails-to-pass-again/","id":2791,"author":{"id":156,"name":"Peter Mounteer"},"related":[2790,2789,2788],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A.S.

The committee will revisit the resolution at its next meeting next Thursday.</p>\n<p>The controversial resolution calls on the university, ASUCSB, the UCSB Foundation and UC Regents to divest from companies selling equipment to the Israeli government for use in “Israel’s military occupation and siege of the Palestinian territories.” The resolution specifically names Hewlett-Packard, Raytheon, Motorola, Caterpillar and General Electric as companies that should have profited due to their sale of various pieces of equipment to the Israeli government including biometric scanners, engines for Apache helicopters and various guided missiles.</p>\n<p>The resolution cites the UC’s historic disinvestment from South Africa over its apartheid policies as precedent for continued divestment from companies doing business with Israel.</p>\n<p>“ASUCSB will examine its assets and UC assets for investments in companies that a) provide military support for, or weaponry to support, the occupation of the Palestinian Territories, or b) facilitate the building or maintenance of the Separation Wall or the demolition of Palestinian homes, or c) facilitate in the building, maintenance, or economic development of Israeli settlements on annexed Palestinian territories,” the resolution states.</p>\n<p>Second-year sociology major, Students for Justice in Palestine member and co-author of the divestment resolution Anumita Kaur read the language of the resolution calling for the university to take action.</p>\n<p>“Let it finally be resolved that we the students call upon our university to disassociate itself from companies that promote systematic discrimination, inequality and human rights violations,” Kaur said. “Where this system targets people based on religion, gender, race orientation by divesting in companies that participate in or profit from human rights violations.”</p>\n<p>Kaur also said it is distressing for students to know that their funds are being invested in companies engaged in military activities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>\n<p>“Knowing that our money is going to companies that provide missiles, going to companies that bulldoze homes, going to companies that provide surveillance systems and biometric systems that are used to restrict freedom of movement — wrong,” Kaur said.</p>\n<p>Second-year biopsychology major Niki Elyasi said the divestment resolution would do nothing to address the flaws in Israeli state policy.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think that being pro-Israel means that you love Israel for all its flaws, because Israel does have flaws, but I don’t think that means that a resolution like this will solve those flaws at all,” Elyasi said.</p>\n<p>Kaur summarized her perspective of the goal of the divestment movement toward the end of her presentation and said, “We are just trying to wash the blood off our hands.”</p>\n<p>A.S. Senator and third-year student Michelle Moreh spoke in favor of some of the more controversial aspects of Israeli policy addressed in the resolution, such as the military blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been in effect since 2007.</p>\n<p>“The reason there is an imposed blockade is because terrorists smuggle weapons into Gaza before that have been used directly to attack Israeli citizens, Moreh said. “If Israel does not restrain to a certain level what goes into Gaza, its citizens are in critical danger.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology and economics double major Guy Singer said he is opposed to the passage of the divestment resolution because it does not include any input from the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>“I want the Jewish community to be involved in some way, and they have not been. In fact, having to take this on this week has been a complete surprise to all of us,” Singer said. “What I’m here to suggest is we vote this bill down, we form an ad hoc committee of certain representatives from certain communities to put forward a bill that addresses the various needs of the communities.”</p>\n<p>Second-year physics major Senator Liam Stanton said he was in favor of tabling the bill for next week and anticipated it will be voted on eventually by the full Senate.</p>\n<p>“Either tabling it here or tabling it in big Senate, sending it there and then tabling it, is the appropriate thing to do, regardless of which side of the resolution you go on,” Stanton said. “I think of course it will get to big Senate.”</p>\n<p>After further debate and discussion a proposal was made to table the motion for one week, with five of the six senators voting in favor and one opposed vote from Moreh, the motion passed.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

She was very strong and would stand up for her opinions about things and so that was something I hugely appreciated from writers.”</p>\n<p>Stone’s friend and fourth-year economics and accounting major Vivian Hu, who met Stone as a freshman Chi Delta Theta pledge, described Stone as frequently being “very positive” and as someone who was friends with students across the entire Greek community.</p>\n<p>“She loved everyone so fiercely. She would go above and beyond for anyone. She would do you any favor, do anything to make you feel better,” Hu said. “She’s probably the only person I can say never had a bad thing to say about anyone else.”</p>\n<p>According to Hu, Stone was selfless in her friendships with others.</p>\n<p>“She would make sure everyone else is okay before she would think of herself,” Hu said.</p>\n<p>Lalita’s former roommate and global studies alumna Elaine Yoo said Stone had a passion for music and had a rich, eclectic musical taste.</p>\n<p>“Every morning when we would wake up we’d listen to a lot of The Strokes,” Yoo said. “She also liked playing the accordion and listening to classical music … [junior year] she was really into Calvin Harris and that’s kind of how it started where she wanted to attend more EDM shows and write about it.”</p>\n<p>Yoo said Stone was planning out her first novel before she passed away.</p>\n<p>“She was actually in the process of trying to write a novel … she had a list that she was making like a plan for herself,” Yoo said. “That was something she was aspiring to do.”</p>\n<p>Stone’s parents will hold a memorial service for her Tuesday, March 10, beginning at 4 p.m. in Loma Pelona Center, Room 1108, near San Rafael Residence Hall and Manzanita Village.

This article has been updated accordingly.]</p>\n<p>The Academic Senate has lifted a <a href=\"http://http://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/academic-senate-approves-suspension-of-admissions-to-ccs-literature-major/\">2014 admissions freeze</a> placed on the College of Creative Studies (CCS) Literature program, effective immediately and opening to students admitted for Fall 2016.</p>\n<p>Admission to the program was suspended on a temporary basis last year by the Undergraduate Council over concerns regarding program leadership, lack of adequate involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty and an underdeveloped relationship with other campus departments.  The Senate approved the decision to lift the freeze by the Undergraduate Council at a meeting last week on Feb. 12.  The suspension of admissions did not affect the degree trajectories of students already enrolled in the program.</p>\n<p>According to Undergraduate Council Executive Director Deborah Karoff, admission to the program was reinstated after the concerns leading to its suspension were addressed and resolved with efforts by multiple campus departments and faculty members.</p>\n<p>“The College of Creative Studies and several other departments on campus worked together to strengthen the involvement of Senate faculty in the program,” Karoff said.</p>\n<p>According to Karoff, it is a norm at the university that Senate-affiliated faculty participate in major programs of all the departments on campus. Karoff also said a number of individual Senate faculty and campus departments have made commitments to support the program in the future in a way sufficient enough to convince the Undergraduate Council to lift the freeze.</p>\n<p>Dean of CCS and professor of paleobiology Bruce Tiffney said the program suffered from lack of a “coherent curriculum” in place to develop foundational skills for literature students.</p>\n<p>“The program did not have a coherent curriculum put together that was allowing students to both clearly develop in their skills as both students of literature and of writing,” Tiffney said. “[The program] was not set up in a manner that would ensure that they would get out and be taking a range of courses outside and encountering these really wonderful faculty the campus has.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney said the decline of Senate-affiliated faculty over the years took place as part of a historical process of faculty engagement issues. He also mentioned that all other programs in CCS except literature have at least one Senate lecturer in their roster, which are faculty members in CCS and its equivalent academic department in the College of Letters and Science. According to Tiffney, a search is underway for a candidate to hold that dual position.</p>\n<p>“That individual will then be a core leader in the program … who has feet in both Letters and Science and CCS,” Tiffney said. “Now that this has been lifted, the is primary focus is to go and … can run a search.”</p>\n<p>Tiffney also said the CCS literature program historically has had a strong creative writing background in its instruction, but that other aspects of literary study were less prominent in the program. According to Tiffney, the program’s name may be changed to CCS Writing and Literature to reflect the greater breadth that comes with more faculty engagement as well as curricular changes. The curricular changes will reflect the increase of involvement from Senate-affiliated faculty as well as structural changes associated with the program’s foundational material.</p>\n<p>“In the past we did not have a set of courses that in essence built from the bottom up and developed a sense of knowledge from the campus of resources of expected areas of expertise,” Tiffney said. “What we are doing here — we did not have this before — would be a sequence of courses that would develop a background in literature … creative writing and then writing studies.”</p>\n<p>CCS literature instructor Angela Holzmeister said she is pleased the program will accept admissions for the coming academic year.</p>\n<p>“My experience teaching literature courses in CCS has been a tremendously gratifying one, due, not in the least, to the impressively intelligent students I’ve had the pleasure of working with this year,” Holzmeister said in an email. “These students are not only testimony to the quality of students admitted into CCS, but they are also the product of the education they receive at CCS.”</p>\n<p>The program will still undergo certain changes as it reopens for admissions, including unapproved curricular and name changes that will be considered at a March 12 meeting of the Academic Senate.</p>\n<p>CCS literature alumnus and current Community Manager of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Tony Pierce said he was pleased with the change in fortune for the program.</p>\n<p>“I’m super relieved that the university has realized that they have a hidden flower patch in CCS Lit that should just be left alone to bloom,” Pierce said in an email.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said in a statement that he is thankful to the various faculty and administrative officials who helped oversee the program’s return.</p>\n<p>“I am very pleased that … Dean Bruce Tiffney and his administrative colleagues have overseen a successful proposal to revitalize CCS’s literature program,” Yang said.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button

policies for deadlines for the March 2 filing of 2015–16 financial aid applications.</p>\n<p>The policy shift comes as part of an effort by the financial aid office to ensure equitable distribution of university funding to students who file their applications on time and to increase the amount of students who file in a timely manner. The shift applies to students applying for university funding using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and CA DREAM Act funding, due March 2. The restrictions on FAFSA filing does not apply to certain funding sources such as Federal Pell grants and scholarships, and is strictly limited to institutional financial aid provided by the university.</p>\n<p>Students who miss the filing date are allowed to make an appeal via the existing appeals process for “on-time status,” which would allow them to be considered for full university funding despite missing the deadline. Additionally, the financial aid office will also be strictly enforcing a June 15 deadline to submit financial aid related documents, such as W-2 tax forms.</p>\n<p>Financial aid office director Mike Miller said while the university has always had priority deadlines for students, they have not been strictly enforced until now.</p>\n<p>“In the past we’ve created a culture of kind of procrastination and there weren’t any penalties for students who didn’t meet the deadlines,” Miller said. “Over the years it’s become a significant issue workload-wise, but also in terms of funding availability.”</p>\n<p>Miller also said stricter deadlines should ensure students do not miss out on funding because university funding is limited and there is significant possibility for the funding to simply run out in part because of an increase in student need for financial aid.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, when our university grant funds run out, which has been happening over the last couple of years because we have more needy students on campus … even if somebody submits an appeal for on time status, if we don’t have the funding then we can’t fund them,” Miller said, “So it’s really important that students get their applications in on time.”</p>\n<p>Miller said while appeals are still an option for late filers, appeals will be granted on a case by case basis for extreme circumstances.</p>\n<p>“We’ll take a look at all the appeals that we get and if there are extreme circumstances then we’ll look at those on a case by case basis,” Miller said. “But if a student misses the deadline and simply sends us an appeal that says that they weren’t aware that they needed verification documents because they didn’t read their email, then those are situations that will likely be denied moving forward.”</p>\n<p>According to the financial aid office, insufficient circumstances do not include lack of knowledge of published deadlines, limited means of communication or email access, events occurring after the deadline, failure to complete the FAFSA based on tax filing status if estimated information is available, a parent’s refusal to provide information on the FAFSA or insufficient financial aid as a result of missing priority deadlines.</p>\n<p>Miller said extenuating circumstances could include, but are not limited to, getting ill, sustaining an injury or otherwise some event that prevents them from collecting the necessary documents. Miller urged students to check their university email account and check the financial aid website as a way to keep up to date on financial aid policies.</p>\n<p>The financial aid office has roughly $60 to $63 million dollars to distribute as well as 17,000 financial aid applicants annually, with average award amounts clocking in at around $6,300 per student. According to Miller, around 2,000 students or 10 percent of filers file their applications after the deadline, typically in September when students enroll for Fall and resume paying tuition.</p>\n<p>“A lot students just won’t complete that [application] until right before they need financial aid,” Miller said, “So there’s a huge delay and in some cases we’ll ask for documentation in March and April and sometimes they won’t turn it in until September and that’s a long time to be sitting on request for documentation especially when it comes to funding your education.”</p>\n<p>However, according to former announcements by the financial aid office, aid awards are distributed beginning in July.</p>\n<p>According to first-year global studies major Mayela Morales, other options aside from strict deadlines exist, including moving existing FAFSA workshops to earlier in the quarter to avoid conflicts with midterms and end-of-quarter academic pressures.</p>\n<p>“I feel like there is other options besides just completely cutting off the flexibility with the deadline,” Morales said. “I see their point of view but there’s other options, because by enforcing that March 2nd deadline you are completely cutting off someone’s financial aid.”</p>\n<p>Third-year psychology major, Johanna, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she was not worried about the stricter policy affecting her because precise tax information can still be provided later as long as estimates are submitted with the application on time.</p>\n<p>“I think that it’s an important deadline that has to be met, and I’ve never worried about missing the deadline so I don’t feel like the stricter policy affects me directly,” Johanna said in an email.</p>\n<p>Miller said the move to tighten restrictions is a campus decision without any push from the state or federal government, while most other campuses in the UC system enforce strict adherence to filing deadlines.</p>\n<p>“We would have several thousand students who just didn’t do anything for themselves until they come back in the fall,” Miller said. “So we would get a huge rush of financial aid applications in August and September and that really created kind of a log jam for us especially when the fee deadline was coming up.”</p>\n<p>According to Miller, looser enforcement has been the norm because it allows for the most flexibility for students to receive money, but an increase in the number of “needy students” has put additional pressure on the office to distribute funding effectively. While part of the $63 million the office annually distributes is for usually set aside for late filers, having as many students as possible apply on time allows the office to better estimate how much funding will need to be distributed all students.</p>\n<p>“Say for example we have 95 percent of our students applying on time; that just gives us a much better baseline to begin the planning,” Miller said. “Just having a better idea of how many applicants we’re going to have on an annual basis, we can really budget out what we’re going to spend a lot more accurately.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

LAFCO is a state-mandated agency present in every California county to oversee the formation of CSDs. AB 3 would establish, by act of the state legislature, an I.V. CSD and thereby bypass the traditional role of LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>The letter was drafted and released at LAFCO’s Feb. 5 meeting and enumerates 11 concerns held by the commission over the bill, primarily regarding the bill’s current lack of specificity over the types of services that would be available in an I.V. CSD and how they would be paid for. Additional concerns questioned the role of the county, Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) and UCSB in a CSD, the makeup of the administrative board in a CSD and how the CSD would be governed after it is formed.</p>\n<p>The commission heard over two dozen speakers during its roughly hour-long public comment period, with primarily I.V. residents, property owners and students voicing their concerns. Following public comment, the commission debated the merits of sending the letter, with commissioners Second District Supervisor Janet Wolf along with LAFCO chair and Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr voicing opposition.</p>\n<p>Commissioners Craig Geyer, Jeff Moorhouse, Roger Aceves, Roger Welt and Jim Richardson voted in favor of issuing the letter, with Farr and Wolf voting against.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61164\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61164\" data-attachment-id=\"61164\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/doreen-farr-speaks-at-the-lafco-meeting-on-february-19th/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5.3\",\"credit\":\"Christina DeMarzo\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on February 19th.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424355612\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"220\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.008\",\"title\":\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on February 19th.\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61164\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-1-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Doreen Farr speaks at the LAFCO meeting on Feb. 19.

We already have law enforcement there,” Mitchell said. “We have a government that deals with those issues already … by creating more government you are asking the students to pay more, you are asking the residents to pay more … we have enough government in Isla Vista already.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_61165\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-61165\" data-attachment-id=\"61165\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-20/lafco-issues-letter-on-ab-3/lafco_christina-demarzo-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1060\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D7000\",\"caption\":\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1424356580\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"155\",\"iso\":\"1600\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"LAFCO\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2.jpg?fit=888%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-61165\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LAFCO_Christina-DeMarzo-2-1024x678.jpg?resize=500%2C331\" alt=\"Roger Aceves and Craig Geyer compare notes as they listen to a community member speak.

By overturning our role in the process to a board like LAFCO we remove our hand from this important step.”</p>\n<p>Schunk also said LAFCO should work to ease tensions between residents of I.V. and LAFCO in order to allow the community to address the concerns the commission is taking on AB 3.</p>\n<p>“We as a community have some trust issues with you all and I would feel that as a board who is made to represent the interests and assert the interests of local districts you would all be willing to compromise with us on that and understand that,” Schunk said. “By allowing us the determination of continuing these talks … you allow us to move forward and answer the very questions you have presented.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, I.V. business owner, UCSB alumnus and community organizer Jay Freeman has agreed to work on a financial feasibility study for an I.V. CSD, and sociology professor Victor Rios has begun an effort to attain $18,000 of university money to fund a demographics study of I.V., to meet the concerns of the LAFCO. Schunk and other speakers also encouraged LAFCO commissioners attend the weekly stakeholders meetings taking place in I.V. to flesh out the specifics of the bill.</p>\n<p>Commissioner Geyer said LAFCO members may be limited in their ability to attend stakeholders meetings because of the Brown Act, a piece of legislation guaranteeing the public’s right to attend and participate in meetings of local legislative bodies.</p>\n<p>“It is hard for commissioners to come to meetings because of the Brown Act,” Geyer said. “We can violate the Brown Act in a very easy manner and I think that’s probably why a lot of us don’t attend.”</p>\n<p>Following public comment, commissioner Moorhouse said LAFCO’s purpose is to create local governments and to encourage county, state and university administrations to assist in demographic and financial feasibility studies.</p>\n<p>“Opposing AB 3 does not mean that LAFCO opposes I.V. self-governance,” Moorhouse said, “LAFCO exists to create local governance, among other things. We are here to help and there is an established process to follow and it works.”</p>\n<p>According to a 2006 law updating the CSD formation process, part of LAFCO’s role in creating a CSD is to ensure 25 percent of residents of the proposed CSD area sign a petition indicating support for the effort.</p>\n<p>Geyer said LAFCO’s role is to ensure public participation in the CSD formation process and expressed concern about inaccessibility of the bill once it moves along in the legislative process.</p>\n<p>“The formation of anything, any special district in Isla Vista, should come back to the local LAFCO. That’s what we are here for. That’s why the legislature invented LAFCO, and LAFCO locally [allows] the public to be involved,” Geyer said. “When this thing heads up to Sacramento, you think you have a hard time making it here [to downtown Santa Barbara], you’re gonna have a real hard time making it up there.”</p>\n<p>The commission amended the several points on the letter before approving it for release. The commission eliminated the first sentence on point three, which falsely stated the bill was introduced in December without public outreach on the concept, when in fact two town hall-style meetings had occurred in the months prior to determine an appropriate form of local government for I.V.</p>\n<p>The commission amended language on point three to reflect concerns that LAFCO would be bypassed as a result of “commission meetings” rather than “community meetings” because of a lack of familiarity with the content of the stakeholders and town hall meetings.</p>\n<p>On item nine, the commission deleted the final sentence, which stated “LAFCO has no authority to deviate from the CSD law regarding makeup of the CSD board” and inserted, “However, if it is determined that state legislation is needed, it could be requested by Santa Barbara LAFCO.”</p>\n<p>On item 11, the language was changed from “if the Isla Vista CSD is formed with LAFCO approval” to “if Isla Vista CSD is formed without LAFCO approval, would the district be subject to the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act after the … CSD is formed?”</p>\n<p>Finally, the commission agreed to issue the revised letter undersigned by LAFCO executive officer Paul Hood, rather than LAFCO chair Farr, who opposed moving forward with the letter and had her name signed to the draft released Feb. 5.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Although a CSD would traditionally need authorization from LAFCO, Williams’ bill bypasses that requirement in favor of approval by the state legislature in light of LAFCO’s disapproval of past I.V. self-governance efforts.</p>\n<p>Historically, every submission to LAFCO to turn I.V. into a CSD or give it other forms of local government has failed, with the commission rejecting CSD petitions for I.V. in 1972, 1975 and 1983 largely due to concerns over financial feasibility. The letter to be discussed next Thursday, written by Third District Supervisor and LAFCO Vice Chair Doreen Farr, expressed the commission’s concern about its lack of involvement in the approval process as well as issues regarding yet unwritten language of the bill and the role of landowners in the proposed CSD.</p>\n<p>“It appears that in its current form, AB 3 intends to bypass the LAFCO District formation process, which is of great concern to CALAFCO and the Santa Barbara LAFCO,” the letter states. “The bill does not state which services and powers are envisioned for a CSD. Usually CSDs fold in existing districts. Are new services envisioned?”</p>\n<p>Chair of the I.V. Property Owners Association Chuck Eckert said that establishment of a CSD for I.V. is unnecessary because the services needed to improve I.V. “already exist.”</p>\n<p>“The position of the property owners of Isla Vista is this: we don’t think that a community services district is necessary … because it wouldn’t address the problems that exist which we believe to be primarily behavioral,” Eckert said. “We believe that all the government institutions needed to address problems related to infrastructure and level of services already exist.”</p>\n<p>Eckert also said the appropriate action the legislature should take includes allowing LAFCO to approve or disapprove a CSD for I.V. after appropriate feasibility research has been done.</p>\n<p>“I think that the proper thing to be done … is to let Das Williams’ bill … set up the things that this commission cannot do,” Eckert said. “Let [the legislature] send the issue back down to [LAFCO] after, for your decision, after a neutral and thorough economic viability study to make a determination if a district is to be formed.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_51559\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-51559\" data-attachment-id=\"51559\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/a-s-execs-give-reports-new-officers-sworn-in-2/senate_williamzhou/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Senate_WilliamZhou.jpg?fit=520%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"520,300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1369266755\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"80\",\"iso\":\"4000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.00625\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Senate_WilliamZhou\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abboud gets sworn in as the new  2013-2014 Associated Students President.

Community Organizer Jonathan Abboud however said that continued neglect of I.V. by county entities such as LAFCO cannot continue if I.V. wishes to attain a form of self-governance.</p>\n<p>“The old LAFCO has a really bad reputation and history for shafting Isla Vista in the Goleta cityhood attempt and our own cityhood attempts,” Abboud said. “It’s been 45 years and nothing’s happened. It’s getting worse and doing nothing is not an option and I think that those who think we should do nothing should then do something themselves.”</p>\n<p>Abboud also said a CSD in I.V. could potentially improve property values for the area and make it a “better place to live.”</p>\n<p>“The bill does not have to bypass LAFCO; it’s still an idea, that’s just one consideration people in the community came up with,” Abboud said. “Even if a CSD is limited [in scope] some sort of policy implementation could improve Isla Vista … it could improve it in a behavioral sense and structurally.”</p>\n<p>But I.V. property owner John Putra said establishing a CSD by act of legislature could undermine the legitimacy of LAFCO by allowing anyone to bypass it.</p>\n<p>“I find the process here is very dangerous from the standpoint of setting a precedent that, once it’s adopted, is going to eviscerate LAFCO because anybody can get around the process by introducing a bill and proceeding to change districts, form districts, without the input of LAFCO,” Putra said. “If this LAFCO does not take a strong stand against this kind of process I think it’s going wind up becoming a powerless agency.”</p>\n<p>According to fourth-year psychology and political science double major and Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk, the option of limiting LAFCO’s role in a self-governance bill for I.V. is more due to practical necessity rather than a dislike or distrust of the agency.</p>\n<p>“As far as precedent is concerned, we have already set some sort of insurmountable precedent just by the nature of being Isla Vista; our situation is so incredibly unique that it requires a unique solution,” Schunk said. “The term ‘bypass LAFCO’ is not necessarily accurate … it’s not necessarily a dislike or distrust of LAFCO; it’s simply the idea that LAFCO may not be able to, given the powers that it has, provide us with all of the things that we need.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59668\" style=\"width: 301px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59668\" data-attachment-id=\"59668\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-02-12/lafco-delays-discussion-opposing-bill-ab-3/das-williams/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Das-Williams_Lorenzo-Basilio-2.jpg?fit=1600%2C1276&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1276\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"2.8\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"EVPLA Cameron Schunk discusses AB-3 with students.

CSD include a user’s utilities tax, where a tax is levied on use of utilities services such as water, electricity and gas, per household. According to Eckert, because most properties in I.V. are “master metered” for water utilities for entire complexes, rather than individual units, the cost of paying taxes on water falls on the property owner, rather than the renter, which is a concern to property owners of I.V. regarding their taxes.</p>\n<p>I.V. property owner Brian Bailey said he does not want to see taxes in I.V. increase further.</p>\n<p>“You’ve been bypassed, you’ve been neutered. What’s up with that?” Bailey said. “I took out our tax bill and looked at it and saw our park district bonds that have been in place for [many] years. They comprise, on this random one I pulled out, 11 percent of my tax bill. I really don’t want more shit on my tax bill.”</p>\n<p>But while Schunk said he could not say if there was “huge community consensus” on the user’s utility tax, in small I.V. town hall meetings he said most attendees agree it is a fairer method of taxation.</p>\n<p>“If we were to do a property tax, we would see only property owners receiving that tax … and logically passing it down to us through increased rent,” Schunk said. “That’s not to say a user utilities tax won’t increase rent per se, but in the sense that cost of living will still increase if you increase taxes. That’s a fact, there’s no getting around that unfortunately.”</p>\n<p>Eckert encouraged LAFCO to amend their letter to include language specifically opposing the bill unless it does not bypass LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>“The letter should be that this commission, you folks, opposes the bill unless it is limited to certain things and unless it leaves the issue of whether or not this district is to be formed up to you,” Eckert said.</p>\n<p>Williams said in a prior interview in December that the details of the services and other specifics on the form and function of an I.V. CSD have not been established because further input is needed from the I.V. community.</p>\n<p>“We do not have all of the details because it is our intention of course to continue the community dialogue that has already been taking place,” Williams said. “We don’t want to rush and just decide what the shape is without continued community dialogue.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Where was LAFCO in 2003? Where was LAFCO when the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury published the report saying we should have a CSD? Where was LAFCO in our past three failed attempts and furthermore where was LAFCO during Goleta’s incorporation? – A.S. EVPLA Cameron Schunk</p></blockquote>\n<p>LAFCO Commissioner Jeff Moorhouse said he thinks AB 3 raises questions about local government jurisdiction and that he opposes the bill entirely.</p>\n<p>“This issue is about, ‘Is it right for the state legislature to tell local people how to form a government?’” Moorehouse said. “AB 3 needs to be pulled. It needs to no longer exist and you need to go through the right process and let [LAFCO] help you.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said, while he respects Moorhouse’s position, he “respectfully disagrees” with it.</p>\n<p>“Part of what we saw at LAFCO is proof that perhaps Mr. Moorhouse needs to do more research into the exact nature of the legislative process for one, and perhaps also be more open-minded to … what we’ve been saying the whole time,” Schunk said. “We’ve never once said that we are doing this because we hate LAFCO and want them to have no part of this; that is not the issue here.”</p>\n<p>According to Moorhouse, who supports the letter in its present form, the university, the county and SBCC are partially responsible for perpetuating problems inherent to I.V.</p>\n<p>“I see the housing crisis, overcrowding, the planning, the parking, the lighting, the sidewalks — it’s all stuff that should have been done,” Moorhouse said.</p>\n<p>“Instead of coming here, ‘LAFCO come help us with a CSD’ you should be taking your time going in front of the county board of supervisors and tell them to start throwing some money your way to start fixing some of these problems because they do have the resources.”</p>\n<p>Schunk said he disagrees with Moorhouse’s comments on LAFCO’s ability to adequately help I.V. given its history of shooting down prior self-governance proposals.</p>\n<p>“Where was LAFCO in 2003? Where was LAFCO when the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury published the report saying we should have a CSD?” Shunk said. “Where was LAFCO in our past three failed attempts and furthermore where was LAFCO during Goleta’s incorporation?”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, the county has limited funding to provide to I.V. because of the realities of governing the rest of the county.</p>\n<p>“Doreen Farr and most of county administrators will agree that the county is doing [its] best and if they could wave their magic wand they would have more revenues and resources for the people of Isla Vista,” Williams said. “But because they represent a countywide government they can’t [allocate] revenue just for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_59590\" style=\"width: 328px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-59590\" data-attachment-id=\"59590\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-08/doreen-farr-discusses-self-governance-during-office-hours/doreen-farr-coffee-collab/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Doreen-Farr-Office-Hourse_Lorenzo-Basilio-1.jpg?fit=1184%2C788&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1184,788\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"Lorenzo Basilio\\/Daily Nexus\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr spoke with students during her \\\"office hours\\\" at the Coffee Collaborative on Thursday afternoon.

Parks and Rec District (IVRPD) board member Paola De La Cruz, Moorhouse’s comments on getting the university more involved in governing I.V. already been tried without success.</p>\n<p>“We have seen that the university and entities in Isla Vista are not addressing these needs … there are other needs that need addressing and they aren’t doing that,” De La Cruz said. “So his response for us to go out to them and to ask for help. We have already done that … so we need to take a bigger step and do something that will actually address our needs.”</p>\n<p>Williams said AB 3 does not set such a precedent, nor does it seek to completely sideline LAFCO in the CSD formation process.</p>\n<p>“There are many CSDs that have been established by the legislature,” Williams said. “This would not be the first; it is not a precedent … LAFCO has an important role in the formation of local government and I want to respect that as much as possible … at the very least [LAFCO] should inspect the financial feasibility report and have an oversight role in the financial feasibility of a CSD for Isla Vista.”</p>\n<p>According to Williams, details on what LAFCO’s oversight role on financial feasibility will be for an I.V. CSD has yet to be determined and that the time for action on a new government for I.V. must happen soon, as the consequences of inaction could result in damage to the community.</p>\n<p>“To me that the most important thing here is that there are people who will be hurt by our failure to take action,” Williams said. “LAFCO might wonder why we are moving so quickly. We are trying to get a strong amount of public input but we are moving quickly because inaction is causing problems in Isla Vista and I am not willing to wait another thirty years for people take action.”</p>\n<p><em>The next Santa Barbara LAFCO meeting will take place at the Santa Barbara County Administration building on 105 East Anapamu Street at 2 p.m. at the Board of Supervisor’s Hearing Room.</em></p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted LAFCO chair Doreen Farr stating the letter was “agonized” for discussion.

The eviction notices gave the tenants, all low-income long-term residents, 60 days to vacate the apartments, according to the Isla Vista Tenants Union.<em> Lorenzo Basilio/Daily Nexus</em></p></div>\n<p>The Isla Vista Tenants Union (IVTU) announced the beginning of a campaign on Tuesday to provide required financial assistance to five households allegedly evicted from Abrego Villas on 6754 and 6764 Abrego Rd. in Isla Vista this past October.</p>\n<p>Following the evictions, which were issued without justification by Abrego Apartments, LLC, under Van Nuys property owner Majestic Asset Management, LLC, the units in Abrego Villas were renovated and the rent was allegedly increased by over 50 percent, which made the units too expensive for former tenants to re-enter. These cases are the latest in <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-01-29/tenants-removed-from-isla-vista-apartment-building-in-mass-eviction/\">a series of past evictions</a>, and under Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444, individuals evicted from households on County land are entitled to relocation benefits in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>In August, six households were allegedly served eviction notices by their landlord at 6754 and 6764 Abrego Rd., one in one building and five in the other. According to the IVTU, the eviction notices gave the tenants — all of whom were low-income, long-term residents, and many of whom were Latino families — 60 days to vacate the apartments.</p>\n<p>The tenants then contacted IVTU and an Associated Students Legal Resource Center and an IVTU-provided lawyer who then informed the tenants of the Ordinance 4444 violation potentially made by Majestic Asset Management, LLC, entitling them to benefits under county law. When the tenants presented their case to the property owner, Majestic Asset Management, LLC refused to grant them benefits and the tenants challenged the landowner over the amount in small claims court, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 11.</p>\n<p>According to the Advising Attorney at the A.S. Legal Resource Center Robin Unander, Santa Barbara County Ordinance 4444 does not take effect in every situation.</p>\n<p>“The interesting thing about the ordinance is that it applies under very limited circumstances,” Unander said. “So what we’ve seen, because these property owners are not coming forward when they decide to make these changes is, they don’t tell the residents, ‘Oh guess what we’re gonna do all this, but we’re gonna offer you some relocation benefits.’”</p>\n<blockquote><p>This does affect the whole community. It’s not just these families, it’s the entire community. Many of them work full-time job and have kids in schools. Some of them had to move kids to new schools and find new jobs. — IVTU President Andrey Bogdanov</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unander also said each evicted household is entitled to up to $10,500 in benefits, paid by Majestic Asset Management, LLC, under Ordinance 4444.</p>\n<p>“We’ve made that known to Majestic and they said, ‘We’ll give them a $1,000 and a security deposit.’” Unander said. “So when we weren’t able to get past that in November or December when it stalled, we filed small claims.”</p>\n<p>However, Majestic Asset Management, LLC has taken the position that the Ordinance 4444 does not apply to them, Unander said.</p>\n<p>“Their position is based on the fact that, before the tenants vacated, the tenants were given 60 days notice,” Unander said, “and before the 60 days were up, before the tenants actually vacated, Majestic was made aware by me that this situation might exist.”</p>\n<p>According to IVTU President and third-year econometrics major Andrey Bogdanov, the property owners attempted to remedy the situation by canceling some evictions, but the effort came too late as the tenants had secured replacement housing by the time the offer was made.</p>\n<p>“Even if they were allowed to stay they couldn’t technically move back in because they can’t have two leases at the same time,” Bogdanov said, “or even if they could move back in, even if that was legally possible, they wouldn’t be able to afford the rent.”</p>\n<p>Representatives for Majestic Asset Management, LLC could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p>According to Unander, Majestic Asset Management, LLC evicted a select number of their tenants and made sure to do no renovations that required permits so as to not trigger the benefits enacted by Ordinance 4444. She also said that once the County became aware of what Majestic Asset Management, LLC was doing, the county ordered the company to cease until they acquired permits. However, the tenants had already signed permanent contracts to live elsewhere when the company offered them the chance to come back.</p>\n<p>“That’s one of the things that takes them out of the benefits,” Unander said.</p>\n<p>Currently, the housing market in I.V. is significantly saturated, allowing unexpected evictions to substantially alter the livelihoods of some residents, especially if they are low-income or have children, Bogdanov said.</p>\n<p>“This does affect the whole community. It’s not just these families, it’s the entire community,” Bogdanov said. “Many of them work full-time job and have kids in schools. Some of them had to move kids to new schools and find new jobs.”</p>\n<p>Bogdanov also said the eviction timing has put a toll on tenants who have consequently had to struggle to find housing.</p>\n<p>“Because they weren’t evicted during the leasing season, in October it’s very difficult to find quality housing in,” Bogdanov said. “Six tenants may not seem like a large number, but since 2002 over 300 households have been evicted.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_60000\" style=\"width: 725px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-60000\" data-attachment-id=\"60000\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2015-01-22/ivtu-fights-for-evicted-tenants/tenants_lorenzo-basilio-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=1600%2C1065&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1065\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"1.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D700\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1421917242\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.004\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Tenants_Lorenzo Basilio-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=250%2C166&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11.jpg?fit=888%2C591&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-60000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tenants_Lorenzo-Basilio-11-1024x682.jpg?resize=715%2C476\" alt=\"The Isla Vista Tenants Union has recently undertaken a campaign to offer financial support to tenants that were evicted without notice last August.

Kramer is survived by his wife, Gail, their children Jeanne and Eric his grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Kramer graduated from Cornell University in 1962 with a Bachelors in chemical engineering and earned a Ph.D. in metallurgy and materials science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1966. He joined the faculty of Cornell University in 1967 and in 1973 authored a paper that greatly expanded current knowledge on a phenomenon called flux pinning, where exceptionally conductive materials are suspended in space above a magnet. While at UCSB, Kramer worked collaboratively with various professors, post-doctoral scholars and Ph.D. candidates, particularly in the area of polymer science, in which he was considered an expert.</p>\n<p>Rod C. Alferness, Dean of the College of Engineering, said the death of Kramer was unexpected despite a recent heart surgery.</p>\n<p>“Its a huge loss,” Alferness said. “It came as a shock; I was not expecting it to happen at this time. There’s a sense of loss both for the college and the university.”</p>\n<p>Kramer’s longtime colleague, chemical engineering professor Glenn Fredrickson, said while Kramer’s heart surgery had taken place several months ago and he was in recovery, Kramer had been active in the research lab and had attended the dissertation defense of two of his Ph.D. students just a week prior to his death.</p>\n<p>“He had been very active and animated during the discussion and questioning period, so we had a sense that he was on the mend and was his old self,” Fredrickson said. “Everybody who had interacted with him just a week ago had a sense that it was all uphill from there, we were really taken aback by this.”</p>\n<p>According to Materials Dept. chair Tresa Pollock, Kramer was a devoted faculty member who took pride in the achievements of the students he mentored.</p>\n<p>“He was a very dedicated teacher and mentor,” Pollock said.“He put a tremendous amount of effort into developing his courses and teaching them carefully.”</p>\n<p>Kramer was set to teach an undergraduate course this quarter in the chemical engineering department, Introduction to Polymer Science, which Pollock said would be filled by Rachel Segalman, a former student and colleague of Kramer at UC Berkeley.</p>\n<p>According to Alferness, Kramer was planning to retire from his faculty position at the end of the year and would not have taken on any new graduate students or postdoctoral researchers, but would have remained with the university as a researcher.</p>\n<p>Alferness also said Kramer was a role model for younger faculty and mentioned that Kramer and his wife donated enough money to the university to establish an endowed chair position that has yet to be filled within the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>“He was a great citizen on campus as well and a strong advocate for UCSB. A very wise person. Everyone will tell you who knows him, he was truly a gentleman and served as a wonderful mentor,” Alferness said. “[Establishing an endowed chair] is not a typical thing for faculty to do; it speaks to his view of the importance of education.”</p>\n<p>Kramer also led the Kramer/Fredrickson research group within the Materials Research Laboratory. The group’s research primarily focused on studying certain properties of block copolymers, materials made up of block-like structures of multiple molecules. Specifically, the group’s recent research has centered on understanding the processes by which certain materials melt, as well as the process of directed self-assembly. According to the Institute for Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, directed self-assembly is a process by which molecules of certain materials spontaneously come together, or “self-assemble”.</p>\n<p>According to Fredrickson, a longtime collaborator of Kramer’s, Kramer was among the first to develop the field of examining directed self-assembly and did some of the early experimentation on the process and that Fredrickson used his work in a theoretical research group in materials research.</p>\n<p>“He did a lot the early pioneering work on directed self assembly … and looking at how polymers assemble themselves in confined ‘wells’ within a thin film,” Fredrickson said. “My group has subsequently developed theoretical tools for simulating polymers under confinement and much of that was simulated by experimental work [from] his group.”</p>\n<p>Fredrickson also said Kramer’s work on the directed self-assembly processes represents an advancement in the way certain products are manufactured.</p>\n<p>“Now its become [a] technology that companies like Intel and Sony viewing it as a strategy for next generation patterning of semi-conductor devices,” Fredrickson said. “Being able to make smaller features on devices than they currently can now, the strategy for making microprocessors faster is to shrink the devices and that requires patterning on smaller and smaller length scales.”</p>\n<p>According to Fredrickson, Kramer was one of the first people to work on the process in a “methodical, systematic experimental way” that has set the stage for it to become a “developing technology.”</p>\n<p>According to Nate Lynd, an assistant professor in the department of chemical engineering at University of Texas, Austin, and formerly a post-doctoral researcher under Kramer at UCSB, the late professor’s work with the group was unique given his level of involvement in the group’s work.</p>\n<p>“Ed very much liked to be involved,” Lynd said. “You would sometimes see the light on in his office in the evening he would be working on data himself which I think is somewhat rare for a professor this late in his career.”</p>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang said Kramer’s contributions to materials science are “legendary”.</p>\n<p>“He helped to elevate the stature of our university and our top-ranked Materials and Chemical Engineering departments, and provided exemplary leadership and service to our campus community in so many other ways as well, including co-chairing the search advisory committees for our previous and current Dean of Engineering,” Yang said.</p>\n<p>Lynd also said Kramer fostered an atmosphere of collaboration in the various research efforts he took part in and various faculty members and departments would be involved in the polymer research Kramer carried out.</p>\n<p>“What was really great about Ed’s group was just how well integrated it was with the research efforts others, with the research of other faculty at UCSB,” Lynd said. “It was this incorporation of the contributions of the expertise of many people that had made a lot of this research great and Ed. This was his modus operandi, and he was a big cheerleader of carrying out collaborative research.”</p>\n<p>Lynd said Kramer aided him greatly in his postdoctoral studies and taught him to work collaboratively with others in the group.</p>\n<p>“Recognizing what kind of peg you are and finding the right hole on the team, that’s something Ed definitely helped me with,” Lynd said, “and since that time things went just great … I really owe a lot to Ed.”</p>\n<p>[Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Kramer’s age as 74, he was actually 75. The article also incorrectly described the directed self-assembly process as spontaneous, it actually occurs in controlled environments under the influence of researchers. The article also incorrectly stated Fredrickson used Kramer’s scholarship in his own work, this is also incorrect, Fredrickson used his work in a collaborative theoretical research group composed of graduate students and other researchers.

However, the resulting proposal to include I.V. and the university in the incorporation plan was voted down by the Santa Barbara County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) in May 2001 in a 6-1 decision.</p>\n<p>The LAFCO commissioners who voted to exclude I.V. argued that the ballot for Goleta cityhood would not pass in the November 2001 election if the boundaries included I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>2001: Goleta Acquires Cityhood, Leaves I.V. to Status Quo</strong></p>\n<p>LAFCO Staff Executive Officer Bob Braitman said I.V. represented a community with a separate identity and different issues from that of Goleta.</p>\n<p>“The Goleta Valley is a complex sub-region of Santa Barbara County,” Braitman said. “It’s unified in many ways, but it’s also very fragmented, both governmentally and in community identity. Many residents of the Goleta Valley perceive I.V. as a separate area, and the I.V. community itself identifies itself as unique.”</p>\n<p>According to Braitman, I.V.’s distinct social environment distinguished it from Goleta in a way that merited its exclusion from cityhood.</p>\n<p>“We could recommend inclusion of I.V. for various reasons, but we see community identity as a strong reason to recommend that the commission exclude Isla Vista and UCSB,” Braitman said.</p>\n<p>Isla Vista Recreation and Parks District (IVRPD) Vice Chairperson Ariana Katovich said in an IVRPD meeting in April 2001 that a concern she had with the plan for inclusion was that it would dissolve the IVRPD entirely, placing I.V. affairs regularly overseen by the IVRPD Board under the control of the City of Goleta.</p>\n<p>“We have been handling affairs in I.V. since 1972,” Katovitch said. “Goleta has no right to take that away from us. Goleta does not have the experience in I.V. park services. It is impossible that Goleta would be able to provide I.V. with a service that is better than what we currently have. We provide everything we do for free.”</p>\n<p>Residents of Goleta such as Robert Conbright also voiced concern on the topic of student voters in I.V. having an influence over local politics, particularly in how money is allocated, given their temporary residence in I.V.</p>\n<p>“If I.V. and UCSB are included, there are people there who will vote for things they will never have to pay for,” Conbright said. “I don’t want people who won’t be here 30 years from now to have a say in how our money is spent.”</p>\n<p>Mark Chaconas, executive assistant to former Third District Supervisor and LAFCO Commissioner Gail Marshall, said the inclusion of I.V. into the new city of Goleta would provide greater state funding for the newly incorporated city as a result of I.V.’s dense population, with a 10-year surplus of $40.13 million provided if I.V. was included and $7.05 million if it was not.</p>\n<p>“From a fiscal standpoint, the numbers are far more compelling,” Chaconas said. “The state provides subventions depending on population to new cities as a ‘jump start.’ I.V. brings a lot to the table, both financially and culturally.”</p>\n<p>IVRPD member Diane Conn said in April 2001 that the possible inclusion provided the opportunity for I.V. to acquire enhanced services needed to develop and improve the I.V. region.</p>\n<p>“Basically, we want urban services and local control,” Conn said. “The only way that I.V. will get the services it needs is to include the I.V./UCSB parcel within the boundaries of the new city. We want to work with Goleta to provide services and to support appropriate development and land use.”</p>\n<p><strong>Early 2000s: Desire For Cityhood Left Unfulfilled</strong></p>\n<p>Conn also said I.V. residents such as local business owner Jay Freeman expressed a desire to be annexed into the city as a solution for sought-after I.V. self-governance.</p>\n<p>“[I.V. residents] wanted the benefits of actually having cityhood,” Freeman said.</p>\n<p>According to Freeman, many Goleta citizens fought against including I.V. into Goleta because of its massive voting power and its broadly liberal base. This, he said, accounted for the end decision not to annex I.V. when the city of Goleta incorporated in 2002, leaving many I.V. residents dissatisfied.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of anger about Goleta not including Isla Vista and making it like an island,” Freeman said. “In the end, Isla Vista ended up getting left alone.”</p>\n<p>Following the incorporation of Goleta in 2002 excluding I.V. from the new city’s boundaries, self-governance for I.V. mostly declined in political prominence for over a decade.</p>\n<p>However, a number of important documents were issued between 2001 and 2003 by a grand jury of Santa Barbara County that assessed I.V.’s needs. In a 2001 report by the 2001-2002 jury called “Isla Vista: Who’s In Charge” and a 2003 report called, “Isla Vista: Take Charge” the jury made recommendations for moving forward with a stronger form of government for I.V. The 2001 report included a strong recommendation to establish a CSD for I.V. It found that existing entities in I.V., including the I.V. Redevelopment District, an agency responsible for overseeing infrastructure maintenance in I.V., did not have the existing funds to properly meet I.V.’s development needs, including the development of appropriate sidewalks.</p>\n<p>Among the recommendations issued by the report included a request to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to establish an agency to “correct the numerous problems” in I.V. Despite the recommendations, the Board of Supervisors took little action on the CSD proposal.</p>\n<p><strong>2014: Violence, Unrest and Tragedy in I.V. Spark Self-Governance Discussion</strong></p>\n<p>On the evening of April 6, 2014, during the third annual Deltopia streetparty that drew thousands of non-residents from across the state to I.V., an altercation between a partygoer and a local police officer exploded into violence. 17-year-old Desmond Louis Edwards from Los Angeles struck a police officer in the head with a bag containing multiple glass bottles of alcohol, severely injuring the officer and initiating an arrest attempt by accompanying deputies.</p>\n<p>A riot ensued, pitting surrounding partygoers against police and resulting in hundreds of students and visitors teargassed and shot at with rubber bullets. Over 300 arrests and citations were issued during the event, a majority of which were given to individuals who came from outside the Santa Barbara area.</p>\n<p>Following the civil unrest that occurred during last year’s Deltopia riots, A.S. held a town hall-style meeting at an I.V. business to discuss solutions to address the issues that led to the unrest. Recent graduate and then-fifth-year anthropology major Josh Plotke spoke at the meeting and encouraged attendees to pursue the formation of a CSD in I.V., stating that a lack of appropriate governmental structure helped cause the unrest.</p>\n<p>Further fervor for a stronger local government for I.V. fomented following the events of May 23, 2014, after 22-year-old Santa Barbara City College student Elliot Rodger perpetrated a killing spree on the streets of I.V., taking the lives of six students, as well as his own. A month later, an A.S. a town hall meeting was held at Santa Barbara Hillel to discuss self-governance options for I.V.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Santa Barbara County Third District Supervisor Doreen Farr said I.V.’s primary obstacle to stronger self-governance lies in its lack of an adequate funding structure for a new government, which is itself impeded by I.V.’s small geographical size.</p>\n<p>“I think that we are making strides on infrastructure, but the key baseline issue is sustainable funding,” Farr said at the meeting.</p>\n<p><strong>Present Day: I.V. Self-Governance, Rekindled; CSD Bill Introduced in State Assembly</strong></p>\n<p>The particular self-governance movement to have gained the most traction during this period has been spearheaded by Associated Students External Vice President of Local Affairs (EVPLA) Cameron Schunk and former A.S. president Jonathan Abboud, both of whom are pushing for a CSD-type special legislative district in I.V.</p>\n<p>Schunk said he hopes to learn from the mistakes of the past in order to create a viable future for I.V.</p>\n<p>“The key aspect of previous movements that I would like to avoid in this one is the ‘us versus them’ mentality,” Schunk said. “Activists felt as if they had to fight against the status quo, and that sort of aggressive tone is off-putting to the powers that be.”</p>\n<p>According to Schunk, the practical matter of pushing forward the special legislative district differ from approaches in the past because I.V. is now different demographically and culturally.</p>\n<p>“I think this movement is inherently different from previous movements simply because Isla Vista is different,” Schunk said. “We’re looking to solve a lot of the same issues. The difference is in the approach and the eventual solution.”</p>\n<p>At follow-up I.V. self-governance town hall meeting sponsored by A.S. in October 2014, attendees at St. Mark’s University Parish were divided into various groups to discuss various possible forms of self-governance. The subjects discussed included the plausibility of turning I.V. into a CSD and thus generating funds for services through a user utilities tax, forming an I.V.-specific Municipal Advisory Council (MAC) composed of appointed or elected members, or attempting to incorporate I.V. into a city again, which would still require the approval of LAFCO as it had in the past.</p>\n<p>The October meeting concluded with a vote on the preferred form of self-governance for I.V., with a majority of attendees favoring the CSD option over incorporation or a MAC.</p>\n<p>This past Monday, Santa Barbara Assemblymember Das Williams, who presented on I.V. cityhood during October’s town hall, introduced a bill in the California State Assembly seeking to establish I.V. as a CSD by act of the legislature. This bill could minimize the role of LAFCO in the establishment process, as the body has opposed increased government options for I.V. in the past.</p>\n<p>According to Williams, further town halls and meetings with I.V. stakeholders regarding the future of self-governance will continue, with the next meeting occurring this Thursday from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. in the conference room of the I.V. Clinic at 970 Embarcadero del Mar. Williams also said that further meetings will allow his bill, AB 3, to reflect the needs of I.V. residents and allow details of the proposed CSD’s structure and function to be further fleshed out.</p>\n<p>“People should understand that there is plenty of time for further public input, and for the stakeholder process,” Williams said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58944\" style=\"width: 717px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"822115420\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58966\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58944\" data-attachment-id=\"58944\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/das-williams-introduces-i-v-self-governance-bill/photo-courtesy-of-the-office-of-assemblyman-das-williams/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams.jpg?fit=6899%2C4816&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"6899,4816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.2\",\"credit\":\"Jeff Walters\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D800\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1417437712\",\"copyright\":\"Jeff Walters\",\"focal_length\":\"50\",\"iso\":\"1000\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.01\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Photo Courtesy of the Office of Assemblyman Das Williams\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams.jpg?fit=250%2C175&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams.jpg?fit=888%2C620&amp;ssl=1\" class=\" wp-image-58944\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Photo-Courtesy-of-the-Office-of-Assemblyman-Das-Williams-1024x714.jpg?resize=707%2C493\" alt=\"Assemblyman Das Williams, right, introduced AB 3 to the California State Assembly yesterday, which aims to establish Isla Vista as a community service district.

Community Council (IVCC) made several other attempts to give I.V. a more sustainable form of government in the years following.</p>\n<p><strong>1972: I.V. Creates Community Services District (CSD)</strong></p>\n<p>Other options for self-governance for I.V. also included the 1972 passage of a bill by the California legislature establishing the I.V. College Community Services District (IVCCSD). This action created a community services district (CSD), a small form of independent government that allows a given unincorporated area to tax itself to provide certain services to itself that cannot otherwise be provided by a county government.</p>\n<p>According to alumnus Josh Plotke, who acted as a research assistant to the recently released UCSB Foundation Trustees’ Advisory Committee on Isla Vista Strategies, I.V. residents pushed for a CSD in hopes of working up to later establishing a city.</p>\n<p>“They tried to create a city without calling it a city,” Plotke said. “They tried to create a law with a CSD with more extended powers than CSD law allowed.”</p>\n<p>Plotke also said the university was opposed to being included in the IVCCSD, which contributed to its ultimate failure.</p>\n<p>“The reason why it failed was the county said they [the CSD] had to include UCSB,” Plotke said. “UCSB at first acted neutral and then hired a publicist and spent $100,000 for a publicist to fight against this thing.”</p>\n<p>In 1972, Plotke said the California state legislature passed a law outlining I.V. as a special legislative district, — or a government created by the legislature to oversee a specific area — which initiated the I.V. Municipal Advisory Council (IVMAC). A municipal advisory council is a body of elected or appointed officials that convene to assess the needs of a given city or county government and recommend specific action. While a CSD can govern by controlling specific services provided to an area, a MAC serves a purely advisory role and has no actual power to provide services.</p>\n<p>Despite the formation of the CSD on paper, the IVCCSD was never implemented as it also required the approval of the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for Santa Barbara County, an independent state-mandated entity responsible for overseeing the establishment of local governments, which rejected the proposal.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58943\" style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-II-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1694545327\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"58941\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58943\" data-attachment-id=\"58943\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-02/i-v-a-history-part-ii/iv-self-governance-feature-ii-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-II-2.jpg?fit=1200%2C647&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,647\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D3&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;IVCC members seemed to be enjoying themselves at last Monday night's meeting.

The plan would incorporate all three areas as portions of the city of Santa Barbara and greatly expand its municipal borders. The university came out in support of the annexation plan, with then-chancellor Vernon Cheadle stating it would provide “the lowest long term tax rates for the greatest number of citizens.”</p>\n<p>The annexation plan was put to an election in March of 1975 that required a majority of voters in both the Goleta Valley area and the City of Santa Barbara to approve the plan. Despite university support for the measure, overwhelming majorities of both I.V. and Santa Barbara residents voted against it and the measure failed.</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident Carmen Lodise’s book <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em>, after I.V.’s failure of annexation to Santa Barbara, the IVCC called for a new advisory election, or plebiscite, to determine the best option for a local government for I.V. Options presented were incorporation of I.V. into a city, incorporation of I.V. with Goleta or maintenance of the status quo. The election, held on May 27, 1975, resulted in an overwhelming majority of support for the independent incorporation of I.V as a city, which at the time had its proposed boundaries include Storke Road, Hollister Avenue and the Venoco Corporation’s Platform Holly oil rig.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em>, the UC Board of Regents was split in its opinion on cityhood for I.V., with at least five regents supporting the proposal. The university, Lodise writes, was opposed to cityhood.</p>\n<p>Following the results of the May, 1975 plebiscite, IVCC made another submission for independent cityhood to LAFCO in 1975 backed with support from the university, which LAFCO rejected again in February of 1976 on a 4-1 vote, citing concerns over the financial feasibility of an incorporated I.V.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons Behind Failure of I.V. Cityhood</strong></p>\n<p>Lodise said he blames the political motivations of the LAFCO members for not approving I.V. cityhood, as the four no votes all came from Republicans on LAFCO, while the only yes came from a Democrat.</p>\n<p>“The wrap was that I.V. was not financially feasible,” Lodise said. “In reality, it was Republicans [on LAFCO] defeating the town because [I.V.] was overwhelmingly Democratic.”</p>\n<p>Plotke said LAFCO could not approve those proposals because various fiscal analyses have found I.V. cityhood to be unrealistic.</p>\n<p>“I.V. is a big financial drain. It’s a small tax space with a dense population that means increased expenses,” Plotke said. “It would be illegal for LAFCO to approve a city.”</p>\n<p>Lodise’s <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History</em> stated that concerns over financial feasibility of I.V. as a city were misguided but important for the Republicans on LAFCO. Lodise wrote that LAFCO was commonly thought to produce numbers on the expenditures a proposed city would make, when in practice such figures are typically determined by the city’s first city council.</p>\n<p>Lodise also stated LAFCO had no authority to use financial feasibility as a criteria in determining the viability of incorporation for a given area.</p>\n<p><strong>I.V. Self-Governance Burns Out</strong></p>\n<p>For the next few years the only governmental entities existing in I.V. were those related to IVCC and the I.V. Parks and Recreation District (IVRPD). The IVRPD oversaw the growth of new parks in I.V. beginning in 1975, adding 14 new parks to a list that originally included Anisq’Oyo Park on Embarcadero Del Mar, “Dogshit” Park along Del Playa Drive and Children’s Park on Picasso Rd.</p>\n<p>Despite this growth, little in the way of additional self-governance campaigns materialized in the years between 1975 and 1982.</p>\n<p>According to Lodise’s <em>Isla Vista: A Citizen’s History,</em> years of tension between the residents of I.V. and Goleta over representation on the Goleta Water Board, which provided water services to both unincorporated areas, contributed to renewed fervor for cityhood for I.V.</p>\n<p>The 1982 IVCC election saw a slate of candidates elected who supported independent cityhood for I.V. and opposed an incorporation plan that included Goleta, which was supported by IVCC executive director John Buttny, who promptly resigned after the election. Also in 1982, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors refused to contribute its portion of funds to the IVCC, a loss of about $10,000. Shortly thereafter, the university, also a key provider of funds to IVCC, also discontinued its funding of the council, an amount of about $9,000, according to Lodise. Funding for the council by the Board of Regents also ended entirely in 1982 after a steady decline from its peak in 1971.</p>\n<p>Despite the funding cuts, the IVCC pressed on with a cityhood proposal, filing it with LAFCO in 1984 which was again rejected in a 4-1 vote. The council lasted for several more years, but without funding went defunct in 1987.</p>\n<p>According to Plotke, after the IVCC and IVMAC lost funding, prompting residents to push for a CSD to try and recover some form of self-governance for the I.V. However, he said, proponents realized that funding for a CSD could not be started until long after the IVCC and IVMAC disappeared, which effectively ended the self-governance movement.</p>\n<p>“They found that there was going to be a gap in funding from the time the funding [for IVCC and IVMAC] was cut off to a time a CSD could be established,” Plotke said.</p>\n<p>According to longtime I.V. resident, local business owner and alumnus Jay Freeman, self-governance talks went on hiatus for over a decade after the defeat of IVCC and IVMAC.

CDP’s are typically under the direct supervision of county governments, as is I.V., which is represented on the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors by 3rd District Supervisor Doreen Farr. The only agency within I.V. that have any authority over the area is the I.V. Recreation and Parks District, which is responsible for I.V.’s numerous public parks.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">When the Board of Regents established Santa Barbara State College as the third campus of the UC system in 1944 and pursued further enrollment, the population of I.V. also began to grow. Despite this, the level of existing infrastructure remained relatively low until the 1960s, when the Board of Supervisors created a zoning committee for I.V. that allegedly allowed development to occur with looser restrictions, according to longtime resident Carmen Lodise.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>The 1970s: Isla Vista’s First Attempt at Self-Governance</b></span></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58903\" style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58903\" data-attachment-id=\"58903\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-01/i-v-a-history-part-i/iv-self-governance-feature-10/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-10.jpg?fit=1526%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1526,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NIKON D3\",\"caption\":\"On Jan. 29, 1970, police beat a student, Chris Hall, during a rally outside present-day Cheadle Hall.

According to the book, a movement to give I.V. a stronger form of government manifested after several civil disturbances in the ‘69-‘70 academic year, which culminated in the infamous 1970 I.V. Bank of America burning and the deployment of National Guard troops to the area by then California Governor Ronald Reagan.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Several months after the bank burning, during a second civil unrest in April 1970, 21-year-old student Kevin Moran was shot and killed by police while trying to put out a fire on the steps of the rebuilt Bank of America building. After previously attributing the death to a sniper, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department admitted several days later that the killing of Moran was from an accidental discharge from a Santa Barbara Police officer’s rifle.</span> </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Following the bank burning, in April 1970 the Board of Regents established a seven person committee to determine the role of UC Santa Barbara in governing I.V. The commission issued a report in October of the same year that became popularly known as the Trow Report, after committee member Martin Trow, a UC Berkeley sociologist. The report contained seven recommendations for university involvement in I.V., among them directing UCSB to adopt policies recognizing I.V. as integral to student life, giving the campus vice chancellor authority over university services in I.V. and building university owned apartments for students in I.V. The report also said the university should act to encourage greater collaboration with the County in governing I.V. and that the size of the student population be limited to 1970 levels.</span></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_58904\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-58904\" data-attachment-id=\"58904\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-12-01/i-v-a-history-part-i/iv-self-governance-feature-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iv-self-governance-feature-11.jpg?fit=1565%2C2000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1565,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D3&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Between 2,000 and 3,000 students crowd the administration building during the second pro-Allen rally in as many days on Jan. 30, 1970.

Community Council (IVCC) was formed and officially recognized by the Board of Supervisors and the Board of Regents, both of which provided funding to the body, which took it upon itself to provide an open forum to allow Isla Vistans to democratically address issues faced by the area. According to Lodise’s book, the council would decide by consensus on actions they believed would serve I.V. and would then present them to various government entities, such as the university and the County. The council, made up of 11 representatives, split I.V. into eight precincts and gave each one a vote.</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Among IVCC’s earliest actions included the establishment of various I.V. groups and partnerships between the university and the County. Among these included the establishment of bus passes for students with the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District, — a practice that continues today — the design and construction of Anisq’Oyo Park, and the establishment of I.V.’s only currently remaining governmental authority, the IVRPD. Various offshoots and commissions were established by the IVCC and included a police commission, a planning commission and an animal control commission. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Isla Vista’s Attempt at Cityhood Shutdown </b></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">According to Lodise, cityhood was first on the minds of many residents following the 1970 Bank of America burning.</span></span></p>\n<p>“<span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">It was not unreasonable to incorporate all the area into a city,” Lodise said. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In </span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><i>A Citizen’s History</i></span></span><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">, Lodise states over 80 percent of the I.V. electorate favored cityhood in an advisory election in 1972. Among the most significant actions taken by the IVCC however was the commission’s role in pushing for cityhood for I.V. and in submitting a proposal for cityhood in September 1973 to the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), a county entity responsible for overseeing the establishment of local governmental agencies. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Adobe Caslon Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">In November of 1973, the Board of Regents, then-UC President Charles Hitch and university administration came out in opposition of including the campus in an incorporated I.V.

The three will travel to Stockholm on Dec. 10 to split the $1.1 million prize. <em>(John Clow/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Materials professor Shuji Nakamura was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics this morning for the invention of the blue light-emitting diode, or <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/led-researchers-propose-design-correct-inefficient-drooping/\">LED</a>, together with Japanese colleagues Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-56636\"></span></p>\n<p>Nakamura becomes <a href=\"http://www.ucsb.edu/nobel/\">the sixth UCSB faculty member since 1998 with a Nobel Prize</a> to their name. In addition to being dubbed Nobel laureates, Nakamura, Akasaki and Amano will receive equal portions of $1.1 million in prize money. Nakamura and other Nobel recipients, not including the Nobel Peace Prize winner, will travel to Stockholm, Sweden, to receive their award on December 10. The rest of the Nobel Prize award winners will be announced later this week by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>The early morning celebration for Shuji Nakamura was short but sweet. Umesh Mishra, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, received a call at 2:45 a.m. from Steven DenBaars, who shares the title of co-director of the <a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2013-11-06/phosphor-analysis-could-improve-led-efficiency/\">Solid State Lighting &amp; Energy Center</a> with Nakamura at UCSB. By around 3 a.m, the three had convened in a campus parking lot with a bottle of non-alcoholic apple cider to toast the most recent achievement of Shuji Nakamura.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nowadays, we can buy energy efficient LED light bulbs at the supermarket and help reduce energy use. I hope it helps to reduce global warming too. —Shuji Nakamura</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nakamura was born and educated in Japan. After graduating from the University of Tokushima, he went to work at Nichia Corporation, where he, Amano and Akasaki developed the blue LED, before coming to UCSB in 2000.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56630\" style=\"width: 238px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"92824741\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56636\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56630\" data-attachment-id=\"56630\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-07/ucsb-professor-shuji-nakamura-wins-nobel-prize/shuji-nakamura-nobel-prize-winner_10-07-2014_john-clow-07/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?fit=980%2C1200&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"980,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412679040\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"18\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.02\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Shuji Nakamura Nobel Prize Winner_10.07.2014_John Clow-07\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?fit=204%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?fit=836%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56630\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07-204x250.jpg?resize=228%2C279\" alt=\"Shuji Nakamura Nobel Prize Winner_10.07.2014_John Clow-07\" width=\"228\" height=\"279\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?resize=204%2C250&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?resize=836%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 836w, https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-07.jpg?w=980&amp;ssl=1 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56630\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nakamura speaks with journalists after the conclusion of the press conference, which was held at the Engineering Sciences Building on UCSB campus. <br><em>(John Clow/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>Nakamura said at a press conference this morning that he was excited to be honored for the invention. He also thanked Nobuo Ogawa, the late chairman of Nichia, and his colleagues at the company for their support.</p>\n<p>“It also makes me happy to see that my dream of LED lighting has become a reality,” Nakamura said in a statement a press conference this morning. “Nowadays, we can buy energy efficient LED light bulbs at the supermarket and help reduce energy use. I hope it helps to reduce global warming too.”</p>\n<p>Nakamura also said he did not anticipate developing the blue LED from the outset of his research but rather started with the goal of simply getting a Ph.D.</p>\n<p>“My dream was to get a Ph.D. At that time, in Japan, by submitting several scientific papers, you can get a Ph.D … you don’t have to go to university … so at the time, my dream was to publish five scientific papers, not blue LED,” Nakamura said.</p>\n<p>DenBaars said Nakamura’s Nobel Prize is well-deserved because it is an important invention to help humans efficiently<a href=\"http://dailynexus.com/2011-01-04/rechargable-lamps-endow-impoverished-brighter-future/\"> light up the world.</a></p>\n<p>“The Nobel Prize is given to the invention which has the greatest impact on mankind,” DenBaars said. “It took twenty years to demonstrate that LEDs have a great impact on mankind. You can go today to Costco and buy a LED TV and then go down the street to Home Depot and buy LED light bulbs. Both of those inventions relied on his breakthroughs.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>This Nobel Prize … underscores the paramount importance of research conducted at the University of California. Professor Nakamura’s dedication to science, research and teaching are a hallmark of our public university — Janet Napolitano</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chancellor Henry T. Yang released a statement of congratulations to Nakamura this morning.</p>\n<p>“This is a most exciting and joyful day of celebration for all of us at UC Santa Barbara, and for our extended community of scholars, alumni, colleagues, and friends around the world,” Yang said in the statement. “Ever since Shuji’s invention of the blue light-emitting diode and energy-efficient white LED, he and our colleagues have been pioneers not only of a new field of research, but of a scientific revolution. Truly we have just begun to explore the full potential of solid-state lighting and energy technologies.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_56629\" style=\"width: 301px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-2.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"559751979\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"56636\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-56629\" data-attachment-id=\"56629\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-10-07/ucsb-professor-shuji-nakamura-wins-nobel-prize/shuji-nakamura-nobel-prize-winner_10-07-2014_john-clow-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=1200%2C696&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,696\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"4.5\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"NEX-7\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1412679276\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"34\",\"iso\":\"800\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0333333333333\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Shuji Nakamura Nobel Prize Winner_10.07.2014_John Clow-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-2.jpg?fit=888%2C515&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"wp-image-56629\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-2-250x145.jpg?resize=291%2C169\" alt=\"Shuji Nakamura Nobel Prize Winner_10.07.2014_John Clow-2\" width=\"291\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=250%2C145&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C594&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Shuji-Nakamura-Nobel-Prize-Winner_10.07.2014_John-Clow-2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-56629\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nakamura poses for the media during the press conference. <em>(John Clow/Daily Nexus)</em></p></div>\n<p>While working for Nichia Corporation, Nakamura discovered the gallium nitride LED which produces a blue light that can be converted to white light using a phosphor coating.
