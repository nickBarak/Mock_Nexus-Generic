What will she look like? Where did she go to school? What team will she play for?</p>\n<p>In reality, people should put these questions to rest and search no further because the best player in the women’s game is already playing.</p>\n<p>She wears No. 3 for the Phoenix Mercury, choosing the number as a freshman at UConn when college coach Geno Auriemma told her she could be the Babe Ruth of women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>He was right.</p>\n<p>After winning two NCAA titles, the UConn legend went on to win two WNBA championships, five scoring titles and two Olympic gold medals. Averaging 20.6 points per game on her career, she’s also an eight time all-star, tying Lisa Leslie for the most appearances in league history.</p>\n<p>Based on those clues, if you still don’t know who I’m referring to, this one of a kind player is Diana Taurasi.</p>\n<p>Like Mike, Taurasi makes her teammates better while knowing when to put the team on her back. She’s not only their vocal leader, but a lead by example kind of player. This season, she averaged 20.2 points and 6.2 assists per game. Last season, the only players in the NBA to accomplish these kinds of numbers were LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook and Stephan Curry. And they did it in 48 minutes; Taurasi only gets 40.</p>\n<p>Quite honestly, one of the reasons that Taurasi is the WNBA’s Jordan is that she plays more like a guy. You can actually compare her. She can shoot threes from NBA range, and often does. She loves contact when driving inside and has incredible hang time for a woman.</p>\n<p>Beyond her play though, Taurasi has the mentality of a man. While she would do anything for the team, she certainly has an ego. Her fiery personality often leads to arguments with referees, which adds to her entertainment value. When you watch ‘Dee,’ you look for her to get T’d up because when she does, it usually means she’s going to go on a scoring tangent.</p>\n<p>But despite the fact that there is typically one player believed to be the best ever, there is never one player that will always be the best. Deciding the top player in any league is always controversial and there will always be a better player that comes along. Jordan is the best NBA player to play in the modern era, but there will be another, just like before Jordan there was Dr. J and Wilt Chamberlain.</p>\n<p>The game of basketball is constantly evolving and as a result, it’s impossible to compare players from different time periods. So, Taurasi is the best right now, but at some point in time, there will be a next best women’s player to play the game. She won’t necessarily be better than Taurasi when compared to the time she plays in, but the game will have grown and changed its style.</p>\n<p>Another comparison that can’t be made in the sport of basketball is men to women. Taurasi has a more masculine style of play, which allows the comparison, but overall, the men and women’s game are too different. When the women find its best player ever, like Jordan is considered, nobody will be saying that she’s the women’s version of Jordan.</p>\n<p>While basketball is basketball, men and women play extremely different styles, the men being more athletic and the women playing a more strategic, finesse game.</p>\n<p>So, when that best player ever arises for the women, you’ll know it because there will be no comparison to the men. The game will have reached the point where women will be respected.</p>\n<p>You’ll simply hear, “That’s _________ and she’s the best player to ever play the women’s game.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of wnba.com</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52308\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52308\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-04/the-wnbas-michael-jordan/","id":3227,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3226,3225,3224],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sacramento Kings Finally See Positive Changes in the Front Office","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sports-art.jpg?resize=750%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After avoiding a move to Seattle, the Kings are trying to regain their stability from the top down.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>With plenty of change for the Sacramento Kings in the past year comes a lot of new pieces to the puzzle — a new beginning, a new owner, a new general manager, a new coach and a new style.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is this is the new era for the Kings.</p>\n<p>New can be good, but it can also be bad.

While it is extremely easy for Ranadive to look like a fantastic owner after the Capital City watched the Maloof brothers’ deceit and lies for far too long, Ranadive has made a great effort to give Sacramento hope again.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, Ranadive appears to have the opposite persona of the Maloofs. He seems to genuinely care about Sacramento and wants to revive the city. What’s key though, is that Ranadive isn’t just talking; he’s actually putting together a great management team.</p>\n<p>The foundation of any sports franchise is the general manager (GM). Thank goodness for Sac Town that’s a new face. Replacing the outdated Geoff Petrie is Pete D’Alessandro. A former executive for the Denver Nuggets and the Golden State Warriors, D’Alessandro is known for his basketball smarts and communication with other members within the franchise. He realizes that rebuilding the Kings is a process and unlike Petrie, knows that you actually need to have talented players to be a playoff contender.</p>\n<p>For example, D’Alessandro inked DeMarcus Cousins, the face of the Kings, to a four-year extension. He traded Tyreke Evans for Greivis Vasquez to aid Head Coach Michael Malone’s effort in creating an unselfish offense and at this year’s draft, brought in a rookie class that with some work could be important pieces in years to come. D’Alessandro also signed a player he is familiar with in power forward Carl Landry, who helped guide the Warriors to the postseason last year. Also fitting in with Malone’s unselfish style of play is new signing Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, who is a defensive specialist on the wing, an important position in this fast-paced day and age of the NBA.</p>\n<p>Ranadive also hired an advisor to help both himself and D’Alessandro. This advisor just happens to be a big name in the basketball world: Chris Mullin. This Hall of Famer, five-time NBA All-Star and member of the 1992 Dream Team not only knows the game of basketball, but has GM experience with the Warriors.</p>\n<p>Bringing in Mullin shows Ranadive is serious about rebuilding. He’s bringing attention to Sacramento while assuring he has great leaders below him. In other words, he’s not taking the easy way out.</p>\n<p>The last piece to the management puzzle, of course, is the coach. Ranadive chose Warriors assistant Malone, who has made clear that the identity of the Sacramento squad needs a revision. Malone also added former player Dee Brown and fan favorite and former King and fan favorite Corliss Williamson to his coaching staff. Williamson has a chance to be an impactful coach immediately, working with Cousins and the fellow big men down low.</p>\n<p>One thing that has been guaranteed to change under Malone is Sacramento’s defense. Last season, the Kings gave up a dismal 105.1 points per game, the worst in the NBA.</p>\n<p>Despite preaching defense, Malone does want to play fast and use the fast break, which suits the personnel of this young, athletic squad with numerous quick guards. The biggest change on the offensive end, though, should be the mentality. Malone is not going to tolerate selfish play, which is one reason the Kings shipped off Evans in turn for a past first point guard in Vasquez.</p>\n<p>When noticing the background of this staff, Golden State comes up a lot. All have backgrounds with the Warriors; they all know each other, know the game, and as a result, are making the transition much more fluid while committing themselves to Sacramento.</p>\n<p>Then, one extra piece was added to the front office. To die-hard Kings fans it was a shock: Shaquille O’Neal became a new minority owner. There is no introduction needed for the retired Lakers big man in the city of Sacramento, but despite the long-standing hatred toward him, which I don’t see changing no matter what he does, he might be the answer to Sacramento’s prayers.</p>\n<p>For several years now, Cousins has not been reaching his potential. He’s had an attitude. He’s been suspended by the organization. He’s downright underperformed, but with O’Neal as his mentor, Cousins could become the franchise player the Kings need him to be. Plus, O’Neal is a huge name in the basketball world and it doesn’t hurt to bring that kind of attention to Sacramento.</p>\n<p>The Kings rewarded Cousins with a big contract and are heavily relying on him to get his personal orders in check and improve his consistency as a dominating basketball player on a nightly basis. It will be up to Cousins to prove he deserved the extension.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, whether the Kings can snap their seven-year streak without making the postseason is in the hands of the players. They determine the wins and losses. But the look of the Kings in the future and putting the pieces together to return to a playoff contender resides in the hands of the management.</p>\n<p>So far, Sacramento is on the right track.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of October 2, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52277\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52277\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-02/sacramento-kings-finally-see-positive-changes-in-the-front-office/","id":634,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[633,632,631],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Sports Editors’ Welcome: Kristen Henneman","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Editors-Welcome-Art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Editors-Welcome-Art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Sports Editor Kristen Henneman's contagious enthusiasm and love for UCSB sports just might make you forget she's not a Laker fan.

I could go on and on, but trust me, there’s something for everyone.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>For those of you concerned that there is no football, I promise you won’t mind. We have real fútbol (a.k.a. soccer), and it’s absolutely fantastic. UCSB isn’t known as soccer heaven for nothing. Last year, the team was ranked as highly as No. 3 in the nation.</p>\n<p>So go to the first game of the year tomorrow against Stanford and give it a try. My first ever soccer game as a freshman was against UCLA. UCSB won 2-0 in a tremendous upset in front of what was basically a sold-out crowd. We set the NCAA record for attendance at a soccer game with 15,896 people, the majority throwing tortillas in celebration. It is one of my favorite memories at UCSB, so I’d love to see all incoming students have a similar experience.</p>\n<p>As for a bit about me, I am a communication major, Spanish minor who would love to turn sports journalism into a career. All my life, sports have been my thing. Most girls have celebrities or pictures of friends on their bedroom walls; I have pictures of basketball players.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think basketball is the best sport on the planet. Whether it’s playing, watching or writing it, men or women, pro, college or any other level, I love this game.</p>\n<p>Coming from the Sac Town area, my favorite team is the Sacramento Kings. I’m extremely excited to see what they do in what’s been deemed a new era. Also, all of you should know that while I currently reside in Laker territory, there’s no saying I love more than ‘beat LA.’</p>\n<p>What makes me different than most basketball fans, and sports fans in general though, is that I prefer the women’s game. I’m currently glued to the television right now with the WNBA playoffs in full swing.</p>\n<p>I grew up playing a bunch of sports year-round, but my dream was always to play in the WNBA. When I realized that wasn’t going to happen, I figured if I couldn’t play for them, I’d write for them.</p>\n<p>And with my love for sports, it didn’t take long for me to fall in love with sports writing. I wrote my first sports piece at 14, and with every article, I fall more and more deeply in love. As tough as it can be putting the sports section together at 1 a.m. sometimes, I do truly adore my job. Plus, I’m extremely proud to say I’m part of a college paper that is ranked No. 9 in the U.S.</p>\n<p>So Gauchos, if you’re a sports lover like me, come see us. Challenge our articles online or, even better, come write for us. Otherwise, I’ll see you tomorrow at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Have a great year,</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Kristen</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of September 26, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52053\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52053\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-09-26/sports-editors-welcome/","id":2094,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2093,2092,2091],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Women’s Basketball: New Look, Same Style","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/basketball-photo_photo-courtesy-of-Ramon-Ravirosa.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/basketball-photo_photo-courtesy-of-Ramon-Ravirosa.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"At this time last year, the UCSB women’s basketball team was coming off a Big West Championship and NCAA postseason berth with almost the entire team returning for this season.

You don’t get to the NCAA in year one. And any time you can be one of 64 or 180 teams playing in postseason play, you have to feel good about that for the future.”</p>\n<p>With the season over, Mitchell has been busy recruiting as she loses three incredibly important seniors in the program to graduation in guard Angelei Aguirre, center Kirsten Tilleman and forward Sweets Underwood.</p>\n<p>Three of the top four leaders in minutes for Santa Barbara this season were its seniors, with all starting at least 30 of the 33 games. Underwood led the team in scoring at 12.2 points per game and, combined with Tilleman, dominated the boards for UCSB, grabbing 9.2 and 7.1 rebounds, respectively. Tilleman led the team in steals with 1.0 per game, while Aguirre led the team in blocks with 0.7 per game.</p>\n<p>“They all led in different ways and had different roles,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, it’s always hard to replace players that have played a lot of minutes because we always know that experience will trump talent.”</p>\n<p>Losing their entire starting frontline, the obvious need for UCSB going into next year is height. The Gauchos have typically been undersized, but Mitchell, who was Rutgers University’s recruiting coordinator for seven years and was known for consistently bringing in the top talent in the nation, seems to have answered the call.</p>\n<p>“I think (last season) the lack of size caught up with us,” Mitchell said. “We all know that against Poly in the semifinals, it was size (that cost us). Hopefully we’ve addressed that with recruiting.”</p>\n<p>The look of the team should be very different next year with five recruits, two transfers and three freshmen coming to Santa Barbara and one more possible recruit in the works.</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s newest recruit is junior forward Hillary Drinovsky. At 6’3’’, Drinovsky signs with UCSB after playing last season for Central Arizona College, which posted a 32-2 record, earning a trip to the NJCAA National Championship Game.</p>\n<p>Coming from New Jersey, Mitchell is familiar with Drinovsky, working with her in middle school when she attended basketball camps at Rutgers.</p>\n<p>Last season, Drinovsky only averaged 2.7 points per game, but shot 45.7 percent from the field and averaged 0.8 blocks per game. She’s known as a more defensive player with a blue-collar mentality. For anyone that’s familiar with UCSB women’s basketball, Drinovsky personifies a lot of the characteristics of Tilleman.</p>\n<p>“One hundred percent that’s the best way to describe her (is like Tilleman), besides the fact that she’s legit 6’3’’ or 6’4’’, so she’s a big strong body,” Mitchell said. “She played on a very successful junior college team. That tells me right away she’s played against elite-level competition. She took a unique route to get to UCSB, so she’s got a bit of a chip on her shoulder and things to prove, but she’ll be the closest in exemplifying our personality and work ethic in the same way that Tilleman did.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s other transfer also comes to UCSB with a lot of experience. Junior Kristine Brance played her first two years at nationally-ranked Chipola College in Florida. Helping the team to the Elite Eight at the NJCAA Woman’s National Basketball Tournament, Brance earned Second Team All-Tournament honors.</p>\n<p>Originally from Riga, Latvia, the 5’7’’ guard also played for her national team during the U20 2011 European Championships. Now coming to Santa Barbara, Brance brings offense to a defensive-minded UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>Brance was the Indians second-leading scorer last season, averaging 14.2 points per game. She shot 39 percent from the field, 36 percent from behind the arc, and a team-best 85 percent from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“Anytime you can bring in an international kid, they have high basketball IQs,” Mitchell said. “She played on a junior college team that didn’t lose a lot of games. You want kids that refuse to lose. Kristine can play multiple positions and give us a three-point threat.”</p>\n<p>As junior college players transferring, both Drinovsky and Brance are expected to make an immediate impact for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“With Hillary and Kristine, we got some hidden talent. I think some people knew about them but I think they’ll be players that in the Big West can make a big-time impact,” Mitchell said. “The programs that they were at automatically give them leadership qualities that are hard to get from freshmen that are just trying to find their way through the college lifestyle.”</p>\n<p>Also giving UCSB more height is 6’2’’ freshman Melissa Maragnes of St. Monica High School. In her senior year, Maragnes earned Division IV All-CIF honors, averaging 9.9 points per game, second on the team. She also tallied 8.7 rebounds, 1.5 blocks and 1.6 assists per game, leading her team to the third round of the CIF State Girls Basketball Championships. Maragnes also owns the Mariners’ single-season blocked shots record with 60.</p>\n<p>“Melissa is going to give us a lot of what Sweets gave — a big-time athlete,” Mitchell said. “She has the ability to put the ball on the floor and attack the rim. She gives us a defensive presence as a shot blocker, but she also runs the floor like a guard. She’s just an athlete that is skillful around the basket, a great rebounder, and gives us some athleticism on the inside.”</p>\n<p>Freshman Onome Jemerigbe also comes from a high school team that knows how to win. Playing for St. Mary’s High School, the 5’6” point guard helped her team to a 32-3 overall and 10-0 league record. The team was ranked No. 7 in California and No. 14 in the nation.</p>\n<p>“Onome is lighting-quick end-to-end and is that guard that is going to give point guards nightmares,” Mitchell said. “She has a pass-first, shoot-second mentality and she’ll be able to get in the gaps and create for others.”</p>\n<p>Finally, Mitchell’s last recruit for next year is freshman Mi’Chael Wright, who at 5’11’’ will play the forward position for the Gauchos. During her senior season at Chaminade High School, Wright led the Eagles to a 30-4 overall record while going 9-1 in conference play. She averaged 12.7 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 0.7 steals and 0.6 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“The best way I can probably describe her is a lot like Angelei Aguirre,” Mitchell said. “She played the power forward in high school, but she has the ability to handle it well enough that at some point we’ll make her a wing player because she does shoot it well and is a great line driver. She just has that blue-collar mentality; just about every game she found a way to get a double-double.”</p>\n<p>Next season, these recruits will join several veteran players for UCSB, including senior guards Destini Mason, Nicole Nesbit and Melissa Zornig.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s going to be a different look for us,” Mitchell said. “We want to open it up more. With Nick, Destini and Onome, you have guards that can create their own shots and create for others. And then we have shooters, like Mel and Christine. I think this is a team with more speed and quickness that we can press an aggressive press, not just a tempo press.”</p>\n<p>Of course, no matter the players, there’s always one thing that will stay the same with Mitchell at the helm: the focus will be defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 29th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Ramon Ravirosa</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51602\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51602\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-29/womens-basketball-new-look-same-style/","id":631,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[630,629,628],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Top Five Reasons to Watch the WNBA This Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The WNBA turns 17 today with the tip-off to a new season.

As a young league, and with many critical of the women’s game, the WNBA has had to prove itself time and time again. Nevertheless, the league has seen great improvement since its inception, with more TV time, greater attendance and more incredible talent than ever before. And this year should be no exception.

Headlined by the “Three to See” in Brittney Griner, Elena Delle Donne and Skylar Diggins, these rookies are going to make huge impacts on their teams right away.</p>\n<p>At 6’8’’ and the ability to really dunk, Griner is going to change women’s basketball. The obvious No. 1 pick in the draft, she brings a defensive presence to a Phoenix team that’s already plenty deep with talent.</p>\n<p>Delle Donne has the versatility that will allow her to become a great player in the WNBA. Though not 6’8’’ like Griner, at 6’5’’ Delle Donne is no slouch in the post, but she can also score from anywhere on the court and has the ball handling skills of a guard.</p>\n<p>Then, there’s point guard Diggins, who can get in the lane or drain the three-point shot. She brings leadership to a Tulsa team that should have a successful season since moving from Detroit.</p>\n<p>All in all, the rookies this year won’t be sitting on the bench but will be determining the success of their franchises.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Competitive Games Every Night</strong></p>\n<p>The WNBA only has 12 teams with six in each conference, so that means that every team is stacked. Unlike in the NBA, there’s no taking a night off. With the WNBA season only being 35 games long, every night counts when determining those coveted four playoff spots in each conference.</p>\n<p>In the past, there were teams like Tulsa or Washington that were always in the cellar of their respective conferences, but not this year. Trades and the WNBA draft have taken care of that. Of course, there are still frontrunners in the league, but every night is going to be a competitive battle and a fun game to watch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Phoenix Mercury</strong></p>\n<p>Possibly the biggest frontrunner in the WNBA is the Phoenix Mercury. After a disappointing season last year, in which the entire starting lineup was injured for the majority of the year, the Mercury acquired the No.1 draft pick and therefore picked up the incredible Griner. Griner will certainly be huge. As a run-and-gun team that in 40 minutes would prefer to score into the 100s (they average more points per minute than most NBA teams), Griner will bring a defensive presence to the squad and her rebounding will simply facilitate the fast break.</p>\n<p>However, even as the future of the WNBA, Griner isn’t the focus of Phoenix because they also happen to feature the best player in the world: Diana Taurasi. The scoring champion almost every year since entering the league, Taurasi can take her defender off the dribble or will sink NBA-range threes. Possibly the biggest competitor in the league and with every basketball award/accomplishment already, she has incredible strength and a great basketball IQ.</p>\n<p>Add to that the versatility of Australian Penny Taylor, Candice Dupree, young point guard Samantha Prahalis and DeWanna Bonner, and you’ve got a Mercury team that’s going to be nearly unstoppable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The Indiana Fever</strong></p>\n<p>If there’s one team that could take the Mercury down, it’s the defending champions, the Indiana Fever. The Fever are always competitive. Leading the team is the WNBA’s best defender, Tamika Catchings. She wreaks havoc on the other team on the defensive end as the league’s all-time steals leader but on the offensive end can kill you, too. She is comfortable playing in the post or on the wing and can absolutely change a game.</p>\n<p>Her running mate, Katie Douglas, returns after spraining her ankle in the Eastern Conference Finals last year. Yes, the Fever went on to win a title without one of their best players. Douglas, who is a pure shooter and clutch handling the ball, will certainly have some motivation to win another title, as she wasn’t able to be on the court to win her first last year.</p>\n<p>Last season, to win it all, the bench players had to step up, and they did. It created a Cinderella-story ending to the season and all those players returns. Indiana is a veteran squad with plenty of weapons, so while Phoenix on paper may be the team to beat, never count out Indiana.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>An Extended Three-Point Line</strong></p>\n<p>As one of the rule changes to this season, the WNBA is moving back its three-point line. The arc moves from 20 feet, 6-1/4 inches to 22, 1-3/4 inches, the same as the international distance. While moving the line back might make some people think there will be fewer threes, I don’t think fans will see a decrease at all. Virtually all WNBA players play overseas during the offseason and are therefore accustomed to this distance. Even with the old line, there were players making NBA-distance threes.</p>\n<p>With the three-point line moved out, this will only spread the court more and give more space for the players to work with. Plus, it’s another movement toward showing that the women can really play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So, for anybody that’s never watched the WNBA, I suggest you give it a chance. It’s definitely going to be a season to remember.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51549\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51549\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-24/the-top-five-reasons-to-watch-the-wnba-this-season/","id":3213,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3212,3211,3210],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB To Begin Loco Rewards Program","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Gaucho-Rewards.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Gaucho-Rewards.jpg?resize=600%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Walking into Harder Stadium for the first men’s soccer game of the year in 2010, 15,896 fans packed the stadium and created a lasting first impression of UCSB athletics for any newly initiated Gauch...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Walking into Harder Stadium for the first men’s soccer game of the year in 2010, 15,896 fans packed the stadium and created a lasting first impression of UCSB athletics for any newly initiated Gauchos.</p>\n<p>UCSB upset No. 13 UCLA 2-0, sending a unified crowd clad in gold into a total frenzy, complete with tortillas flying through the air.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara has led the national attendance mark for men’s soccer for six consecutive seasons.

The Loco Rewards program is an incentivizing campaign to get students more involved in UCSB athletics.</p>\n<p>For the price of under $10 per quarter, this year-long program involves multiple free giveaways, beginning with one soccer-themed and one basketball-themed T-shirt. This is the same style T-shirt that has been given out at the first men’s soccer game in previous years.</p>\n<p>Like in years past, the shirt will be gold, and if you wear it certain on days, there will be deals in participating Isla Vista restaurants to receive either free or discounted items.</p>\n<p>In addition, the rewards program includes free bus rides and admission to the away Cal Poly soccer game and the Big West Basketball Tournament.</p>\n<p>As a rewards program, the more events students attend, the more points they will accumulate, resulting in a chance to win unique prizes such as iPads, flat-screen TVs and Nike apparel.</p>\n<p>With all of these incentives along with game-day giveaways, any student who is part of the Loco Rewards program will surely receive more value out of the program than the monetary amount they put in at the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>The vision of the athletic department is not only to increase attendance at UCSB athletic events, but to expand student enthusiasm and unity, as was displayed at the UCLA game.</p>\n<p>For example, in the glory days of UCSB basketball when the Gauchos defeated No. 1 UNLV, the Thunderdome was the place to be. Glimpses of this energetic atmosphere certainly have occurred in the last two to three years, such as against Long Beach State or Cal Poly, but we would hope this rewards program would help to bring back this fervor at UCSB athletic events.</p>\n<p>Even by attending one or two events, such as a softball game or a water polo match, students will have an opportunity to win worthwhile prizes. They will not be exclusively for the students who attend the most events, like the Gaucho Locos.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, as students we have the privilege of attending all UCSB athletic events for free. For most schools, Associated Students cover the cost of student tickets in their budget, but UCSB Athletics bears the burden here in Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>At several institutions, students even pay to attend sporting events such as basketball games. Here, the UCSB athletic department provides the student body with 35,000 free tickets each year for a $350,000 value.</p>\n<p>The first men’s soccer game after students return to Isla Vista will be against Stanford on Sept. 27, where the attendance is expected to be over 10,000. This will be the biggest opportunity to be a part of the Loco Rewards program.</p>\n<p>As students, we want to bring awareness and gain more UCSB student’s perspectives on this program. Let us know what you think and leave a comment online. After all, it is a program for the students.</p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 8 of May 23, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Art by Mingchen Shen of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51534\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51534\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-23/ucsb-to-begin-loco-rewards-program/","id":3212,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3211,3210,3209],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Here We Buy, Here We Stay","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kings-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kings-art.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"I have to say, I thought they were gone.

This vote came a little over a week after the relocation committee had unanimously recommended the team stay in Sacramento.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Maloofs settled on the Sacramento group to take the reins and has signed a deal.</p>\n<p>The team from the Pacific Northwest is being sold for an NBA record $535 million. Vivek Ranadive, the head of the new ownership, will purchase the 65 percent share currently owned by the Maloofs and their business partner, Robert Hernreich. Nevertheless, the Maloofs are in so much debt, owing approximately $150 million to the city of Sacramento and the NBA, that they will receive about $200 million.</p>\n<p>One clear advantage Sacramento seemed to have in gaining the relocation committee’s recommendation is the continued support and loyalty for the Kings since it came to Sacramento in 1985.</p>\n<p>With 19 sellout seasons, the Kings own one of the longest streaks in NBA history. But even more than that, the fans have shown incredible support during the time when the team was vulnerable and the team’s future was unknown.</p>\n<p>Taking the slogans of “Here We Buy” and “Here we Stay,” Sacramento fans were going to make it difficult to have their team stolen away. On Feb. 9, Kings fans orchestrated a “Here We Buy” night, selling out the arena with more than 16,000 fans to watch the Kings beat the Utah Jazz. For a not so great team to sell out against another mediocre team in Utah, now that’s dedication. And after the game, fans stayed put, rallying and not giving up.</p>\n<p>Then, during the Board of Governors meeting, Sacramento paid to have a 30-second ad supporting the city’s bid to keep the Kings playing every five minutes in Times Square.</p>\n<p>Even as the season came to an end, fans didn’t let up. After the final game of the season against the Clippers, fans once again didn’t leave their seats, staying an hour after the game with chants of “Here We Stay” and “Sacramento.” It was all that could be talked about, even in the Clippers broadcast post-game show.</p>\n<p>Leading the show though for Sacramento has been Mayor Kevin Johnson. And really, he hasn’t been given enough credit for what he’s put together in such a short amount of time. The retired Phoenix Suns guard had to act fast and with efficiency to combat a strong bid from Seattle.</p>\n<p>And even when it seemed all hope was gone and NBA Commissioner David Stern had announced Sacramento’s offer was nothing close to that of Seattle’s, Johnson continued to work around the clock. He’s been part of putting together the arena deal and of course was monumental in pitching everything to the committee. If there’s one guy who Sacramento owes a few extra thank you’s to, it is without a doubt Johnson.</p>\n<p>The deal is arguably the best possible scenario for the Kings. They get rid of the horrible owners, get fresh faces, a new start and remain in a city that loves them.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the team might be becoming free of the Maloofs, who have owned the majority interest in the team since 1999. In the last year, the Maloof name has become known like a cuss word or even have become used as verb meaning “to mess up.”</p>\n<p>The people that were once loved by the city and known for attending every Kings game have been MIA for a while now. They are clearly broke, which should’ve been obvious the second they could no longer afford the cheaper WNBA Sacramento Monarchs.</p>\n<p>At that time, they also began their lying, which has continued up until the team was sold. When the team was unanimously recommended to stay in California’s capital city, the Maloofs threatened to keep the Kings unless relocation was approved and they could sell to the Hansen and Ballmer group, only to announce how pleased they were to sell to the Sacramento group after relocation was denied.</p>\n<p>In addition, Ranadive becomes the first Indian-born owner in the NBA’s history. He already has ownership experience as part of the group that bought the Golden State Warriors and as a result was involved in building their arena.</p>\n<p>With Ranadive’s background, the Kings could also open up a new way of marketing the NBA globally, as the NBA is looking into reaching India.</p>\n<p>While the Maloofs certainly needed to go, the next person to be dismissed will probably be general manager Geoff Petrie. His contract is up and, to be honest, he should’ve been given the boot years ago. The only problem was that the Maloofs were too blind to see it.</p>\n<p>For years, Petrie has slacked doing his job, giving away all the players from the glory days and getting nothing in return. Sacramento fans, you can thank Petrie for the fact that your team has been battling to stay out of the cellar in the Western Conference. He may have been brilliant at one time, bringing in Chris Webber and Bibby and the great Kings we all know, but ever since, he’s been almost worthless.</p>\n<p>Although Head Coach Keith Smart still has one year left on his contract, he is also likely to be dismissed, leaving a fresh start for the Kings, which is exactly what it needs. Finally, there is hope to returning to the glory days. The team is not only very young, but well under the salary gap and therefore will have plenty of money to bring in some talent.</p>\n<p>Finally, the last thing the Kings will get with the deal is a brand new arena. Arco Arena (for true fans it will never be anything else) is a loved building in Sacramento, but seeing some of the newer arenas around the NBA, it really is in bad shape. The Kings’ future includes a $447 million downtown arena that will be built at the western gateway to the city near the Sacramento River.</p>\n<p>Seattle does absolutely deserve a team. There’s no arguing that. Those fans were also very loyal to their team and had it taken away, but they just can’t have ours.</p>\n<p>The best option would be expansion. Throughout the battle for the Kings, Stern was adamant that there would be no expansion, but it is a logical idea. Seattle would get its team and there are plenty of other viable cities that could be picked from to round out the NBA to a total of 32 teams. That would mean two conferences of 16 teams and four divisions of four teams. Half the teams make the playoffs, half don’t. It all makes sense.</p>\n<p>Of course, now that the deal is done, Stern has praised Seattle’s proposal and is saying that the league might consider expansion if a new TV deal could be made. Stern covered his back keeping another team from relocating under his reign. To expand would be another possible positive action he could take before retiring next year.</p>\n<p>Besides, if the Kings had relocated, they would’ve become the SuperSonics and the entire history of Sacramento would disappear.</p>\n<p>So live on the great memories in Sacramento — the cowbells being so loud that opposing teams hated playing in Sacramento and the great rivalry between the Kings and Lakers. Live on the legacies of the great players that have played there — Mitch Richmond, Mike Bibby, Peja Stojakovic, Bobby Jackson, Doug Christie, Chris Webber and Vlade Divac. And live on the idea that the Sacramento Kings could one day win a NBA championship.</p>\n<p>For people like me and all the people in Sacramento, this is our team and they are finally here to stay.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of My 20th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Mingchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51449\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51449\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-20/here-we-buy-here-we-stay/","id":3211,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3210,3209,3208],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"LeBron James Deserved A Unanimous MVP","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"For those of you that follow NBA basketball, it was absolutely no surprise that LeBron James of the Miami Heat won the prestigious MVP award.

He becomes just the fifth player to win a fourth MVP award, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six MVPs), Michael Jordan (five), Bill Russell (five) and Wilt Chamberlain (four). Those, of course, are some of the greatest names in basketball history and James’s achievements put him in their company. What’s more, as James is just in his 10th year in the league at just 28 years old, James could even pass these all-time greats.</p>\n<p>Winning back-to-back MVPs is not easy. Many people don’t think the same player should earn it in consecutive years regardless of whether or not that player was the best that year, but there was no taking that award away from James this year. He was dominant, and as a result, earned 120 of the 121 first-place votes.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>This might sound nitpicky, but James was robbed of a unanimous MVP vote. It should have been unanimous. He deserved for it to be unanimous.</p>\n<p>It would have been the first ever unanimous MVP vote. There have certainly been some unbelievable players in this league, but of course, there is always competition. This year though, James was simply that much better than anyone else.</p>\n<p>The MVP voting panel is made up of 120 sports journalists and broadcasters, with one vote also being an online fan vote. Obviously, there was one journalist who wasn’t so objective and failed in doing his/her job correctly.</p>\n<p>In my lifetime of basketball, I have never watched a player that I felt was head and shoulders above the rest enough to deserve the honor of an undisputed vote, but this year, it should’ve happened.</p>\n<p>Part of this is due to injuries. Many candidates throughout the season fell out of the race due to injury, such as Chris Paul or Tony Parker. Then take out Kobe Bryant having a chance to win simply because his team barely made the playoffs.</p>\n<p>That left James mainly in a one-man race with Kevin Durant. However, I am certainly not implying that James was simply handed the award; he completely earned it. Even halfway through the season, it seemed he was going to be the dead-obvious winner.</p>\n<p>This year, James became the first ever NBA player to go six straight games scoring at least 30 points while shooting at least 60 percent from the field. If that wasn’t enough, he became the youngest player in NBA history to reach the 20,000 point plateau for his career. Then, he took five of the six Eastern Conference Player of the Month awards.</p>\n<p>Also, James is now the second player in league history to post at least 2,000 points, 600 rebounds, 500 assists and 100 steals in a season twice, with Larry Bird doing it three times. The only other player to ever accomplish such a feat once was Michael Jordan.</p>\n<p>James wasn’t just taking easy shots either. He’s become a smart player offensively with time, becoming the second player in NBA history to shoot 55 percent from the field and 40 percent from behind the arc, joining Chris Mullin.</p>\n<p>With such a spectacular season, who could have possibly earned that other first-place vote? It would be natural to think it was Kevin Durant, since he did come in second in MVP voting and had a great year.</p>\n<p>But no. It went to Carmelo Anthony from the New York Knicks, who finished third in the voting. This is where nothing makes sense, except for the fact that perhaps there is a New York reporter who has some beef with James. After all, there is an intense rivalry between those two teams.</p>\n<p>Yes, Anthony did win the scoring title this season, narrowly defeating Durant by scoring 28.7 points per game. But James averaged 26.8 points per game while tallying 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists per night. He shot a career-high 56.5 percent from the field, 11.6 percent higher than Anthony.</p>\n<p>James is also known for his defense, while Anthony is not. James earned the second-most votes on this year’s NBA All-Defensive team. He averaged 1.7 steals per game and, of course, is known for his monster blocks tracking down players in transition. He’s not a center, but he makes his opponents think twice.</p>\n<p>And yes, New York did go on a 13-game win streak at the end of the season to secure the second spot in the Eastern Conference, but James led Miami to the second-longest winning streak in NBA history at 27 games to secure the best record in the NBA, tallying 15 double-doubles and two triple-doubles in those 27 games. Plus, during New York’s win streak, they played Miami and did win, but the Heat had benched both Wade and James in order to save them for the postseason.</p>\n<p>Anthony is hands down a great player — there’s no denying that — but the MVP is supposed to go to the player that had the best year and Anthony should not have been in the running. James simply outdid everybody else.</p>\n<p>So to that one voter who voted for Anthony, you took away a great moment from one of the greatest players in the game and voided him of an NBA record he undeniably deserved. Shame on you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51416\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51416\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-17/lebron-james-deserved-a-unanimous-mvp/","id":3208,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3207,3206,3205],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Returning to Top Form","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/M-Soccer-File-Photo.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/M-Soccer-File-Photo.jpg?resize=520%2C300&ssl=1","description":"After going 11 games to start the season without losing and earning a national ranking as high as No. 3, the UCSB men’s soccer team fell to Cal State Northridge Oct. 7.

Santa Barbara finished last in the North Division of the Big West, compiling a losing Big West record for the first time since 1991 and failing to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 11 seasons.</p>\n<p>“At one point in the season, we were 8-0-2 and it felt like we were in a really good position to not only make a playoff run but to compete for national championship,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “Then, over the course of three weekends we started to lose players (to injury). We lost Campion, Schmetz and then it went from there. By the last game of the season, we had seven starters from the start of the year out.”</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The team loses six seniors to graduation this year, including midfielders Machael David and Nic Ryan. David was known for his control on the ball as defensive midfielder, but also tallied 10 assists during his career.</p>\n<p>Ryan, the reigning Big West Midfielder of the Year, led UCSB and ranked third in the Big West in goals with eight.</p>\n<p>“We lose a group of players which had been four-year key contributors,” Vom Steeg said. “We definitely lose some key players out of our midfield, but the fact is that it’s not as much about what you lose as what you return.”</p>\n<p>With the majority of the team still intact and seven starters returning, UCSB will look to continue its excellence as one of the country’s premier soccer programs next season. To help, UCSB brings in a big recruiting class composed of eight freshmen and four transfers.</p>\n<p>Headlining UCSB’s recruiting class are forward Reed McKenna and defender Isaiah Trejo, who are already at UCSB and played with the Gauchos during their spring season.</p>\n<p>“Both these players are expected to contribute right away, which is why we brought them here in spring,” Vom Steeg said. “We’re very familiar with both these recruits because these are players we recruited out of high school.”</p>\n<p>McKenna will fill a big weakness of UCSB’s from last season, which was putting the ball in the back of the net. The junior comes to UCSB after two seasons at UCLA and is a former No. 2-ranked Southern California player.</p>\n<p>“Last year when we started to lose our players to injury, we just stopped scoring goals,” Vom Steeg said. “Reed McKenna will go a long way toward filling that void. We need somebody to play with Campion, who had the ability to score 12 or 13 goals, so that’s why Reed is an important player to our team.”</p>\n<p>Trejo, a Clovis, CA native, returns to California after two years at Louisville. As a result, Trejo comes with lots of experience, playing for a program that competed for the national championship two years ago.</p>\n<p>“Trejo is an attacking wide player that can play in back,” Vom Steeg said. “We’ve always had that player that can come out of the back and attack wide. Trejo will give us the ability to attack out of the back.”</p>\n<p>Another transfer for UCSB is midfielder Adis Islamovic from Southern Polytechnic State University. There, he led his team to a 2012 NAIA Elite Eight appearance, earning second-team All-SSAC while tallying nine goals and five assists during the season.</p>\n<p>“[Adis] is a very good player who was unable to come here directly out of high school. He decided to go play a year in Germany,” Vom Steeg said. “He is an attacking midfielder. With the players we lost in David, Ryan and Josue Madueno, he is a player that can fill in that role.”</p>\n<p>As for the freshmen, three players that could make an immediate impact are goalkeeper Josh McNeely and midfielders Drew Murphy and Nick DePuy.</p>\n<p>McNeely has played for both the Los Angeles Galaxy Academy and the U.S. Soccer Development Academy. He was also a starter for the 2011 U.S. Soccer Academy National Championship team. With senior André Grandt graduating, McNeely fills the gap of a second goalkeeper.</p>\n<p>UCSB also brings in a teammate of McNeely’s from the Los Angeles Galaxy Academy, Drew Murphy. While playing with the Galaxy, Murphy also trained with the MLS Champion first team and was a member of the 2011 U.S. Soccer Academy’s National Championship team.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have to see which of the freshmen are able to step up to this level and that’s a little bit hard to tell,” Vom Steeg said. “I think we are particularly high on those that are playing at a high level (right now). The two players we have playing for the Galaxy, Josh and Drew, are two players because of where they’re playing right now at one of the top, if not the top club team in the country, so you might expect that they could contribute right away.”</p>\n<p>Finally, Nick DePuy becomes a Gaucho after earning the co-captain spot for Real Colorado, which went to the 2011 Region IV Quarterfinals and the Colorado State Championship. In addition, at Regis Jesuit High, DePuy led the team in goals and earned All-State and All-Conference honors.</p>\n<p>“[Nick’s] another midfielder who we feel has played at a high level and could contribute in the midfield,” Vom Steeg said. “We have a group of midfielders that we’re bringing in, so along with [Fifi Baiden], the big question going into the fall will be who plays in those other two or three spots based on who we play?”</p>\n<p>The slew of incoming players for UCSB will join seven returning starters next season, including 2012 all-Big West First Team member Baiden and the Big West Freshman of the Year, Ema Boateng.</p>\n<p>“What we are returning is basically seven starters and six of them are seniors,” Vom Steeg said. “There’s a lot to be excited about in terms of what’s returning.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will start their season August 24 against Westmont, marking the beginning of an exciting preseason schedule that includes teams such as Penn, UCLA and Yale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 15th’s edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Daily Nexus File Photo</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51390\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51390\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-15/returning-to-top-form/","id":1622,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1621,1620,1619],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Student-Athletes Honored at Golden Eagle Ceremony","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Most colleges say they take pride in their student athletes and their success, not only in their sport but in the classroom as well.

The golden Eagle Ring award is given to the female and male athlete with the highest overall GPA.</p>\n<p>Tilleman boasted the highest GPA of any student athlete at 3.96. Earning the honor for the second consecutive year as a graduate student, she studies in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. Staahl, meanwhile, is a computer science major with an impressive 3.85 GPA.</p>\n<p>The complete list of winners include junior Kyle Boswell of the men’s basketball team (3.78 GPA), Tilleman of the women’s basketball team (3.96 GPA), senior Courtney Lightfoot of the women’s cross country team (3.30 GPA), senior Andre Grandt of the men’s soccer team (3.48), senior Erin Ortega of the women’s soccer team (3.41 GPA), junior Andriana Collins of the softball team (3.59), senior Andrew Latimer of the men’s swim and dive team (3.33 GPA), junior Anne Peanasky of the women’s swim and dive team (3.69 GPA), senior Benjamin Recknagel of the men’s tennis team (3.45 GPA), senior Erica Cano of the women’s tennis team (3.31 GPA), junior Winton Nguyen of the men’s track and field team (3.53 GPA), senior Helena Montin of the women’s track and field team (3.40 GPA), Staahl of the men’s volleyball team (3.85 GPA), senior Erica Lau of the women’s volleyball team (3.53 GPA), junior Matt Gronow of the men’s water polo team (3.32 GPA) and senior Rachel Nelson of the women’s water polo team (3.92 GPA).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle.jpg\" data-slb-active=\"1\" data-slb-asset=\"1905358072\" data-slb-internal=\"0\" data-slb-group=\"51377\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51378\" data-permalink=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-14/ucsb-student-athletes-honored-at-golden-eagle-ceremony/golden-eagle/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle.jpg?fit=4320%2C3240&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4320,3240\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"3.8\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"VLUU WB210, SAMSUNG WB210\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1368475436\",\"copyright\":\"COPYRIGHT, 2010\",\"focal_length\":\"7.7\",\"iso\":\"640\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.0222222222222\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Golden Eagle\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle.jpg?fit=250%2C188&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle.jpg?fit=888%2C666&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-51378\" alt=\"Golden Eagle\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Eagle-250x187.jpg?resize=250%2C187\" width=\"250\" height=\"187\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of May 14, 2013’s print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Kristen Henneman</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

However, Game One was in Golden State’s control. Late mistakes and a failure to close out the contest allowed the veteran San Antonio squad to take the early series advantage, but the underdog Warriors absolutely proved it should be a very close series.</p>\n<p>The Warriors may have five players averaging more than 12 points in the playoffs, but there is only one name that really matters for the Warriors and that is Stephen Curry. The young player has become one of the great point guards in the league and didn’t disappoint in Game One against the Spurs, totaling 44 points on 18-35 shooting, including six three-pointers and 11 assists in nearly 58 minutes of play.</p>\n<p>Easily the MVP of the playoffs so far, Curry can do it all offensively. Get up in his face and he’ll drive by you and make an easy layup, or even a difficult circus shot in the lane if there’s help. Sag off of him to stop the drive and he’ll drain the three-point shot. This season, with his quick release, Curry overtook Ray Allen for most three-pointers in a season in NBA history.</p>\n<p>Not to mention he’s a point guard, so he has no problem sharing the ball and racking up his assist numbers. He averages 9.6 assists in the playoffs, the best in the NBA. In fact, in the Denver series, Curry became the only player in NBA history with at least seven assists and four three-pointers in four straight playoff games. And he did it in the first four playoff games of his career.</p>\n<p>Curry also ranks third in player efficiency rating, behind only Kevin Durant and LeBron James. Those are big names to be grouped with for a man that was left off the All-Star team this season. Curry has something to prove, and overcoming the Spurs and winning a second-round playoff series for the first time since the 1974-75 season would be the perfect way to do it.</p>\n<p>This season, the Warriors and Spurs split their series 2-2, with each team winning on its own home court. Yet while the Spurs finished in second in the Western Conference, the Warriors finished sixth, and still have a lot of room for improvement, especially in the turnover department. If this young, athletic Golden State team can draw out the series, the more of an advantage it has as it may be able to tire out a veteran team.</p>\n<p>Plus, Golden State has possibly the best home court advantage, with a crowd and city that has gone crazy for its team given its lack of success in the last few decades. If the Warriors can steal one on the road, which they proved in Game One that they have the potential to, the home court advantage could push the series in their favor.</p>\n<p>Finally, both teams have proven they love to play the up-tempo style, wanting to put lots of points on the board. Golden State leads the league in points per game during the playoffs at 110.0, although San Antonio is close behind at 109.0. In the end, this style should benefit the Warriors because if you’re going to run, young, athletic teams will usually win the race.</p>\n<p>Either way, if Monday’s game is any indication, it’s going to be a very entertaining series.</p>\n<p>Prediction: Warriors in seven</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of May 8th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Anna Xu of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-08/the-young-warriors-versus-the-veteran-spurs-stephan-curry-takes-golden-state-to-victory/","id":2104,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2103,2102,2101],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Wide  Open Western Conference: Oklahoma City is Still the Team to Beat","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kevin-Durant-art.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Kevin-Durant-art.jpg?resize=900%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Miami takes the East, Oklahoma City takes the West.

Up until the injury, he appeared in an NBA-best 394 straight regular season games and played in all 45 of the Thunder’s playoff appearances.</p>\n<p>Westbrook’s absence leaves no clear taker in the Western Conference. Up 3-1 in the series with Houston, OKC will certainly advance to the next round, but without its all-star point guard, there is also doubt as to whether the team will make the NBA Finals for a second consecutive year.</p>\n<p>The West is a deep conference with seeds one through six all showing they have potential to go far into the postseason. When OKC defeats Houston, it will play the winner of the four/five series, which is a very close series between the L.A. Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies. Memphis would be a better matchup for the Thunder because Memphis is a more defensively-oriented team. However, the Clippers, with Blake Griffin and a deep pool of guards, including Chris Paul, Chauncey Billups, Eric Bledsoe and Jamal Crawford, could give the Thunder troubles on both ends of the floor.</p>\n<p>If the Thunder can get by L.A., they’ve probably got the best shot at taking the West, since San Antonio doesn’t have the young athleticism to come close to matching OKC. And the Golden State Warriors and Denver Nuggets both lack the experience and depth that OKC has.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that a team typically has to be peaking and playing its best basketball during the playoffs, the Thunder have the depth to still go all the way.</p>\n<p>Filling in for Westbrook is the young Reggie Jackson. He’s only a rookie and has little postseason experience as a result, but he is very athletic. The Thunder like to score, ranking third in the NBA with 105.7 points per game, and Jackson can certainly help the team do that.</p>\n<p>He’s a versatile athlete, and, like Westbrook, will push the ball. He certainly isn’t going to average Westbrook’s dynamite stat line of 23.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists per game, but Jackson has already stepped up for OKC. He’s averaged 11.8 points per game in the playoffs, over six more than his regular-season average. Without Westbrook, he’s increased that number to 16.0 points per game, proving he could be a solid role player for the Thunder down the stretch.</p>\n<p>OKC may be starting a rookie, but it has one of the best veteran point guards coming off the bench in Derek Fisher. Fisher is calm and poised with the ball and his past has definitely proved he can hit any shot no matter the pressure.</p>\n<p>Another offensive threat for the Thunder is guard Kevin Martin, who is great moving without the ball but can also knock down the three. He averages 14.0 points per game and shoots an impressive 42.6 percent from behind the arc, spreading the defense and clearing space for all-star Kevin Durant.</p>\n<p>Thabo Sefolosha isn’t going to look all that impressive on a box score, but he’s OKC’s defensive stopper and could cause havoc for guards like Stephen Curry or Manu Ginobli. On an offensively-minded team, Sefolosha brings the balance.</p>\n<p>Down low, Serge Ibaka is the big force for the Thunder. Extremely athletic, Ibaka has averaged 13.5 points and 3.5 blocks per game in the playoffs. It may be Ibaka that turns out to be the X-factor for OKC as he went off for 17 points in the first victory without Westbrook, but scored just eight in the loss Monday night. The Thunder may have lost a guard, but Ibaka’s production may determine how far the team goes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Oklahoma City Thunder now solely belong to Durant. The player who will finish second in MVP voting averaged an NBA second-best 28.1 points during the regular season. During the playoffs, Durant has only improved those numbers, averaging 33.0 points, 5.8 assists and 8.0 boards per contest as well as 48.8 shooting from the field. Without Westbrook, Durant will be the glaring focus for the other team, but so far he’s responded, dropping nearly 40 points in the two games without Westbrook.</p>\n<p>For Durant, it’s time to step up and put the team on his back. That’s what the best players do. If he wants to prove he should’ve been a true candidate for the MVP, this is the time. It’s his team and his chance to shine.</p>\n<p>Oklahoma City may be facing adversity, but now it has some extra motivation to make it back to the NBA finals. They’ll be playing with Westbrook in mind. Never doubt a team with something to prove.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of May 1st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Minchen Shen of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51117\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51117\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-05-01/a-wide-open-western-conference-oklahoma-city-is-still-the-team-to-beat/","id":3193,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3192,3191,3190],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Solving the ‘Hack-a-Howard’ Dilemma","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dwight-howard-trendingsearches.net_.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dwight-howard-trendingsearches.net_.jpg?resize=560%2C421&ssl=1","description":"Earlier this season, on March 12 to be exact, Dwight Howard tied his own NBA record for most free throws shot in a game with 39 attempts against the Orlando Magic.

DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings shot the second highest amount of free throws of any center in the NBA and he took 423. In the NBA as a whole, Howard ranks second in free throws per game with 9.5.</p>\n<p>With such a poor free throw percentage, teams have become smart, creating the Hack-a-Howard phenomena. It’s not completely new; it wasn’t rare that opponents would hack former Laker Shaquille O’Neal (of course termed Hack-a-Shaq). Unlike with Shaq, who was grabbed once he received the ball, teams are now fouling Howard off the ball.</p>\n<p>Intentional fouling off the ball can only be done until the final two minutes of the game, at which point it is no longer allowed. Up until that point, Howard becomes an extreme liability on the court.</p>\n<p>In the defense of Howard, he isn’t the only one being hacked. DeAndre Jordan of the Los Angeles Clippers is receiving the same treatment, as he is one of the worst foul shooters in the league at a dismal 38.6 percent from the charity stripe. However, Howard draws much more attention, partly because of his star status, partly because he’s a Laker and also because the Clippers have a backup for Jordan, whereas the Lakers have no solid sub for Howard. As a result, Jordan shot just 249 free throws this season, about a third of what Howard shot.</p>\n<p>Many basketball fans (Lakers’ fans specifically) are questioning if a rule should be implemented to stop the hacking, but really, there is no answer. Fouling off the ball is not allowed in final two minutes of the game, putting an end to the Hack-a-Howard, but to make a rule where you can’t foul off the ball during the entire game would be ridiculous and would question the integrity of the game.</p>\n<p>There’s already a six-foul disqualification rule for a reason. Fouling off the ball happens and is valid. Besides, there is no reason to make a rule for basically one player. What L.A. fans need to realize is that the rule is not the problem, Howard is.</p>\n<p>Free throws are about three key concepts: mental toughness, muscle memory and hard work. A player has to put in the time at the gym to get it right.</p>\n<p>This year, Howard made approximately $20 million. There is absolutely no reason that a player making millions of dollars should get away with this. He’s being paid to play a sport that he should love and if being paid that much, to do it well. Let’s be honest, a high school basketball player, on average, shoots a better percentage than Howard. Hire a coach or do whatever you have to do, but there is no excuse to make less than half of your free throws.</p>\n<p>So do I like the Hack-a-Howard strategy? No. After all, basketball is a game for entertainment.</p>\n<p>However, I’m not going to deny it as a valid strategy. Basketball is about exploiting your opponent’s weaknesses and while Dwight brings a lot of positive aspects to the game, he is a downright horrible free throw shooter.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Hack-a-Howard is a valid option for teams. If down, you save time on the clock, earn more possessions and, chances are, you’re going to have the opportunity to gain ground on the Lakers. In his 76 games this season, Howard missed an average of five free throws per game. That can give any team the momentum it needs to turn the ball game around. And if you do have a lead, you’re taking away the option of the Lakers finding a better and more reliable shot, like from Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>Basketball is about making other team adjust and the Lakers will have to do that. If a team starts to hack, take Dwight off the floor. That’s what the Clippers do with Jordan. However, Howard’s contract ends after this year and he will become a free agent, so the Lakers have to keep him happy and, as a result, leave him on the floor.</p>\n<p>Really though, allowing Howard to stay on the floor does nothing for his team. His teammates, coaches and the city of Los Angeles clearly have no confidence in him, so it’s not helping to build team chemistry. The missed free throws simply cause frustration. Plus, they’re obviously not helping the Lakers win ball games.</p>\n<p>If you must, keep Howard happy for this season, but if the Lakers (or whatever new team) re-sign him, they should put him on the bench when opponents start to hack. He doesn’t deserve to be on the floor if he can’t make free throws. It’s not any different from the end of a ball game and you’re up one with the ball, so you put your best free throw shooters on the floor. If Howard’s not one of them, sit him on the bench.</p>\n<p>From an early age, players are taught that free throws can win or lose games. Howard needs to figure that out if L.A. wants to win.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of trendingsearches.net</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-51025\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-51025\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-26/solving-the-hack-a-howard-dilemma/","id":3182,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3181,3180,3179],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"A Bright Future for the WNBA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In its 17-year history, the WNBA has been the target of a lot scrutiny and criticism.

Campaigned as the “3 to See,” Brittany Griner, Elena Delle Donne and Skylar Diggins will make an immediate impact on the women’s game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Brittany Griner</span></b></p>\n<p>Griner has become a household name in the basketball world with her 6’8’’ frame. With a wingspan longer than that of Andrew Bynum, Griner brings a presence that the WNBA has never seen before. Yes, there have been taller players than Griner to play in the WNBA, but none that can jump or have the talent of Griner.</p>\n<p>Coming from Baylor University, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind, including Griner’s, that she would be going as the No. 1 pick to the Phoenix Mercury. General Manager and Head Coach Corey Gaines knew as well, even if he tried not to admit it.</p>\n<p>The accolades for Griner are numerous. She set an NCAA record for blocked shots, ranks second on the all-time scoring list, tallied a 50-point performance last season and led the Lady Bears to a perfect, unprecedented 40-0 season in 2011-12. Not to mention, she’s already dunked 18 times. And these are real dunks.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Griner will change the game with her dunking and blocking ability. Heading to Phoenix, there was an initial question of whether she would fit in with the Mercury’s run and gun high-paced offense. However, Griner’s rebounding ability will only jumpstart Phoenix’s break and give them a post presence in the half court set they’ve yet to have.</p>\n<p>Plus, for a team that doesn’t focus on defense, Griner’s blocking ability will only help the Mercury execute its game plan: outscore the opponent.</p>\n<p>For the first time in years, all the attention will not be on Griner. The game will be more physical for her, but she won’t have the constant triple team she’s accustomed to. The reason for that is that Phoenix also happens to feature the No. 1 player in the world — and I’m not talking about Griner.</p>\n<p>Diana Taurasi is back this season after missing last season with a hip flexor injury. She’s the best scorer in the world and can knock down the three-point shot from NBA range, which will allow Griner freedom down low.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to bet on who will win the WNBA championship this early, especially with the defending champion Indiana Fever returning its core group, but it is certain that Phoenix should dominate the Western Conference and be contending for a WNBA championship.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Elena Delle Donne</span></b></p>\n<p>After this year’s NCAA Tournament, Delle Donne has become America’s sweetheart in a women’s basketball jersey.</p>\n<p>She boasts a phenomenal story, signing with Connecticut after becoming one of the top high school recruits in the country only to leave overnight during the summer without telling anyone due to homesickness. She wasn’t enjoying basketball anymore and stepped away from the game.</p>\n<p>Thankfully for women’s basketball, Delle Donne did return to basketball, but this time for Delaware, the college close to home.</p>\n<p>Dominating for the Fighting Blue Hens, Delle Donne led her team to the school’s first ever Sweet 16 performance, going in as the underdog and defeating great teams like North Carolina.</p>\n<p>Like Griner, Delle Donne is used to seeing double and triple teams on a nightly basis, but what sets Delle Donne apart is her versatility. Delle Donne is 6’5’’ and can easily body up down low, but she also has a spectacular three-point shot and the ball handling skills of a guard.</p>\n<p>She finished fifth on the all-time NCAA scoring list, finishing with over 3,000 points, which is remarkable considering she missed time on the court during her career due to Lyme Disease.</p>\n<p>She’s a player unlike anybody the women’s game has ever seen before, almost resembling a combination of Lauren Jackson and Diana Taurasi — which says a lot considering those are the best two players in the women’s game today.</p>\n<p>Delle Donne will join the Chicago Sky, a team with potential that has also never made the playoffs. Playing with the great inside presence of Sylvia Fowles and young guards like Courtney Vandersloot and Epiphanny Prince, Delle Donne will fill a large role in the forward position and should mesh well with Swin Cash on the wing.</p>\n<p>Despite the recent media attention that comes with her success, Delle Donne still remains an underrated player after playing at a smaller college. But look out Eastern Conference, she’s ready to play.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Skylar Diggins</span></b></p>\n<p>Notre Dame’s all-time leading scorer, Diggins brought the Fighting Irish back into the national spotlight in women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>While she leaves without a national championship, Diggins is the future point guard in the WNBA.</p>\n<p>A solid all-around player, Diggins has great range on her shot, but also can be deceptively quick getting into the lane, showing essences of a Becky Hammon-like guard.</p>\n<p>However, Diggins also gets it done on the defensive end and is known for picking the pocket of her opponents’ point guard, leading to easy layups on the other end.</p>\n<p>As equally important as her play, though, is her leadership. For Notre Dame, Diggins was always the player to get her teammates fired up and has a competitive spirit unmatched by any other rookie this year.</p>\n<p>Selected as the No. 3 draft pick to the Tulsa Shock, Diggins goes to a team that will probably surprise people this season. Tulsa has yet to find success since its days in Detroit and finished last in the Western Conference the last two seasons.</p>\n<p>However, they are a completely different team than last season, and Diggins will fill a role much needed by the Shock. She will facilitate an offense with plenty of talent, playing beside Stanford grads Candice Wiggins, Nicole Powell and Kayla Pedersen. All will be great options for Diggins on the drive and dish, or she can lob the ball down low to the young Australian, Liz Cambage, who, by the way, is also 6’8’’.</p>\n<p>She may be a rookie, but this point guard could lead the Shock to its first successful season. Already beyond her years, this team will belong to Diggins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With all bringing something different to the table, Griner, Delle Donne and Diggins have created a buzz around the WNBA this season.</p>\n<p>The WNBA is continuously improving and showing the capability of women as basketball players. With every year, the league brings in more and more talent, and this rookie class is absolutely no exception.</p>\n<p>For a still very young league, the future looks bright.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear int eh print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50929\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50929\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-19/a-bright-future-for-the-wnba/","id":3184,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3183,3182,3181],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Clippers are the Team to Beat in LA","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/clips.jpg?resize=250%2C156&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/clips.jpg?resize=250%2C156&ssl=1","description":"The Los Angeles Lakers have always dominated basketball in L.A., overshadowing the Clippers and stealing the attention.

That’s 29 years that the Clippers have gone without winning the Pacific Division.</p>\n<p>In addition, the victory gave the Clippers the sweep in the series with the Lakers for the first time since they were known as the Buffalo Braves in 1974-75.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>The team will enter the NBA playoffs with the fourth seed in the Western Conference, despite having the fifth best record in the conference.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Clippers have definite potential to go far into the postseason.</p>\n<p>For one, they are one of the best athletic teams in the conference with a number of players that the team can lean on for offensive production.</p>\n<p>The number one option, of course, is Blake Griffin, who averages 18.2 points per game. After the Slam Dunk Competition in 2011, any basketball fan knows he is explosive and can jump.</p>\n<p>But he’s also extremely strong and surprisingly quick for a big man, allowing him to get deep into the lane and finish. As he continues to work on his outside game, Griffin is certain to become one of the best players in this league.</p>\n<p>However, even with Griffin, the team would not be great if it weren’t for its floor general in Chris Paul. Paul is such a unique player nowadays, being one of the few true point guards remaining in the game. His ball-handling skills and quickness make him a very fun player to watch and at times he can be too unselfish.</p>\n<p>With his finesse in the lane, CP3 nearly averages a double-double with 17.0 points and 9.2 assists. An MVP candidate for much of this season, he is a nearly impossible match-up for any team.</p>\n<p>Unlike many teams in the NBA, the Clippers have then surrounded their stars with a mix of solid players. They have balance, combining veterans with young rising stars, defensive players with offensive ones as every player knows his role.</p>\n<p>For example, Jamal Crawford averages 16.7 points per game this season, adding another huge offensive threat to the team.</p>\n<p>Caron Butler adds another ball-handler and three-point threat as he averages 38.5 percent shooting from behind the arc this season. This spreads the floor, allowing an open lane for Griffin or Paul on the drive. Chauncey Billups, AKA Mr. Big Shot, can knock down the long ball too and adds another veteran leader as an option for Head Coach Vinny Del Negro.</p>\n<p>Then, there’s Matt Barnes, who had jumped around from team to team over the course of his career, but definitely seems to fit with the Clippers. He does average double-figure scoring, but Barnes brings an edge to the team and will always scramble for the loose balls.</p>\n<p>One of the Clippers’ most improved players is DeAndre Jordan. The man is certainly athletic, as shown by his monster dunk over Brandon Knight in March, but Jordan brings a solid defensive presence more than anything. He leads the team this season in blocks with 1.3 per game, serving as that important force in the key that makes any player think twice about going to the basket.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Clippers are finally a force to be reckoned with in the NBA. While the Lakers might be the team that continues to get a lot of media coverage, it’s the Los Angeles team in the red, white and blue that has the best chance to make some noise come playoff time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of The Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-50812\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-50812\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-04-12/the-clippers-are-the-team-to-beat-in-la/","id":3181,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3180,3179,3178],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":6,"highestPage":15,"route":"/authors/71"}},"__N_SSG":true}
