Yet, despite Auriemma’s incredible reign at the helm of UConn women’s basketball, he has yet to take the throne as the best ever coach in women’s basketball.</p>\n<p>And he never will because of a woman’s legacy who changed the course of women’s basketball forever and even more broadly, changed the way people think about women. That woman, of course, is Pat Summitt.</p>\n<p>Before Summitt, women weren’t considered competitors, nevertheless athletes. Today, people take women’s sports seriously, which wasn’t the case before her. Women’s equality in sports has a long way to go, but even if you don’t watch the Final Four, you see women’s basketball as a sport.</p>\n<p>She coached before and after Title IX, making $8,900 a year when she started at a school that wasn’t on the map in the basketball world. Summitt drove the bus and did the team laundry. The NCAA didn’t even recognize women’s basketball as an officially-sanctioned sport when Summitt took the head coaching job.</p>\n<p>As a young coach, Summitt rooted her team in defense. Today, defense is one of the biggest focuses in the women’s game. To say Summitt didn’t play a part of that would be ignorant.</p>\n<p>From a popularity standpoint, Summitt put people in the stands to watch females play. In fact, more people headed to the Lady Vols’ games than a game for the men’s team. Her team earned more exposure than the men too. If modern women’s sports had to say thank you to someone, Pat Summitt would be one of the people at the top of that list.</p>\n<p>Women in all sports owe something to Summitt. Without her, there’s no path for Auriemma.</p>\n<p>When Summitt stepped down in 2012, announcing early onset dementia as the cause, women’s basketball lost what Wooden called “the best coach in NCAA basketball history.”</p>\n<p>Honestly, any writer could write a book simply on her accomplishments alone. In her 38 years as head coach of the Lady Vols, Summitt compiled 1,098 wins, the most in NCAA history in any sport male or female. Of the 161 athletes she coached, 94 are current coaches and 12 went on to become Olympians. And if that’s not enough for you, with her eight NCAA championships, she was named the Naismith Coach of the Century.</p>\n<p>As a result, Summitt is argued by many to be the greatest college basketball coach of all time, and one of the best in any sport.</p>\n<p>In a world where women were seen as inferior, she coached her athletes like men. There was no daintiness in practice, running them out of the gym. Those blue eyes could be daggers, but she always got the best out her athletes.</p>\n<p>She created fantastic players, but worked even harder to make them good people, earning a 100 percent graduation rate. Summitt is a class act and it’s earned her respect nationwide. Ever since the diagnosis announcement, “We Back Pat” shirts have been seen on college campus all over the U.S.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that no matter what happens in the future, the women’s sports will owe great appreciation to Summitt. There’s a statue outside Tennessee’s gym of her and the court is named after her, all for a reason.</p>\n<p>No one person has done more for one sport than Summitt and that’s something championships don’t show.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of npr.org</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54801\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54801\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-10/the-everlasting-legacy-of-pat-summitt/","id":2051,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[2050,2049,2048],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Pass the Torch","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Womens-Basketball-10-2-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Womens-Basketball-10-2-Peter-Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"After a Great Freshman Season, UCSB Looks to Onome Jemerigbe to be the Team’s Floor General","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Four seconds remained on the game clock.

For Head Coach Carlene Mitchell, however, it metaphorically meant something more, something positive for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>On a team dominated by seniors, it showed the reins of the team being passed to Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>“I kind of liked at the end of the year meeting [talking to her about how] even though we didn’t call the last play to have the ball in her hands in our last game against Davis, she wanted it,” Mitchell said. “That tells me a lot about her drive, and it’s only going to fuel her to work harder.”</p>\n<p>Named to the Big West All-Freshman team, Jemerigbe played well beyond her years this season. She quickly became a staple in Santa Barbara’s starting lineup, playing the most minutes behind the three seniors.</p>\n<p>In fact, after starting 26 of UCSB’s 30 games, Jemerigbe became the first freshman to start more than 20 games since La Shay Fears in 2005-06 and just the fourth in the past 14 years, joining elite company in Kristen Mann and Mia Fischer, as well as Fears.</p>\n<p>“I remember when we told her we were going to start her. I go, ‘Are you nervous?’ And I can remember her looking at me and she was like, ‘Yeah. I’m really nervous.’” Mitchell said. “But she never looked back after that. She’s so competitive, she wants to win and she knows how to win.”</p>\n<p>Jemerigbe made her biggest impact on the defensive end. Although listed at just 5’5’’, Jemerigbe used her speed and quickness to hassle opponents on all 4,700 square feet of the court, ranking second on the team in steals at 1.1 per game.</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, Jemerigbe gave the Gauchos something it hasn’t seen in many years: a true point guard. With her pass first, shoot second mentality, Jemerigbe registered 67 assists this season, which ranks eighth all-time amongst UCSB freshmen.</p>\n<p>“She exceeded what I knew she had ability-wise,” Mitchell said. “We knew the natural God-given ability, but her understanding of the game and competitive spirit were far greater than I anticipated. I think she had an outstanding freshman year.”</p>\n<p>While Jemerigbe’s ability to adapt to college basketball could easily be attributed to her time at UCSB, Mitchell acknowledged other sources for the freshman’s transition, including one much closer to home.</p>\n<p>The Stockton, California native is the youngest of four children, all of whom are involved in sports. One family member in particular has made the biggest influence on Jemerigbe, her older sister Afure.</p>\n<p>“[Afure] knows the whole DI, student-athlete life, so she’s my biggest role model,” Jemerigbe said. “She gives me so much advice. It’s cool having somebody older who’s already been through it and can guide me through it. Even though she’s not here, I can still talk to her over the phone and text. She’s always giving me advice and encouraging me.”</p>\n<p>Afure Jemerigbe is currently a senior at Berkeley and a star on Cal’s women’s basketball team. Playing a shooting guard, Afure started all 32 games for the Golden Bears, serving as one of the team’s biggest three-point threats. She averaged 12.1 points per game this season.</p>\n<p>“[Onome’s] one of those that watches and evaluates. I think she was able to watch Afure,” Mitchell said. “I think any time you have an example of older siblings or family members that have been successful at the college level and you’ve seen their ups and downs and what they had to go through, it gave her a head start on the mindset she needed to play at this level.”</p>\n<p>With a three-year age difference, the Jemerigbe sisters played together at St. Mary’s High School in the 2009-10 season, which only aided the young Jemerigbe.</p>\n<p>“It was so much fun,” Jemerigbe said. “She’s like my best friend, so it was no drama; it was all fun. She would encourage me when I got on the court and tell me what I needed to work on.”</p>\n<p>Now, Jemerigbe will try to take a page out of her older sister’s book on the offensive end. Seniors Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason accounted for 64.3 percent of the Gauchos’ scoring this season.</p>\n<p>As a natural distributor, Jemerigbe averaged just 5.8 points this year, although she proved she could produce at the rim for herself too, scoring in double figures in five games. In the next few years, Mitchell will ask for more.</p>\n<p>“Nic, Mel and Destini aren’t going to be there next year, so I have to pick it up a lot more that they’re gone,” Jemerigbe said. “I need to be more of a leader. That’s what we lack the most right now since they were our leading scorers.”</p>\n<p>And with all three seniors playing the guard position, Jemerigbe will also become the guard with the most experience and be asked to lead her team. Even as a freshman, Jemerigbe showed she could lead by example, but now, her team will look for its point guard to be the floor general.</p>\n<p>“With a year under her belt, I think she had already led by example in her work ethic and competitive spirit, but now she’ll add that element of being a little more vocal,” Mitchell said. “She’s a starter and an all-freshman team player and she earned that right by working hard every day.

On the offensive end, the two are tied for third in the Big West in hits, recording 289 on the season. The Gauchos and Matadors also go one and two, respectively, in at bats this season.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB features a more balanced attack with three players with over 20 runs and four players that have fit four home runs this season.</p>\n<p>One player hitting extremely well this year has been freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark. Leading off for the Gauchos, Clark leads the Big West in hits with 62 on the year. She’s also hit four triples and ranks first in conference with a .431 batting average.</p>\n<p>“She’s definitely taken on a big role,” Pilpil said. “She had to fill in the spot of Jessica Soria [from last year] at the top, so she’s doing a really good job and working hard. Even though she’s a freshman, a lot of people look to her as one of our most consistent players. We expect her to come through and she’s been doing a really good job.”</p>\n<p>CSUN will look to the offensive prowess of freshman first baseman Taylor Glover. Up second in the rotation, she ranks third in conference in runs at 29, second in hits with 52 and is tied for first in triples with five on the year. Glover also tops the Big West in RBI with 35 and is the third-best in slugging percentage at .618.</p>\n<p>Where the Matadors may have the edge is in the circle. As a team, Northridge ranks second in the league in hits, giving up just 6.36 per game, as well as in ERA at 2.67.</p>\n<p>Leading the pitching staff is junior Brianna Elder, who holds an impressive 17-6 record on the year and ranks second in the Big West with a 1.89 ERA. After giving up just one earned run in 14 innings last weekend in CSUN’s series over UC Davis, Elder was named Big West Pitcher of the Week.</p>\n<p>However, junior pitcher Jordan Sauceda could also cause problems for UCSB as she ranks third in the conference in ERA at 2.62.</p>\n<p>“We need to score more runs,” junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom said. “We didn’t score that high last weekend, so we want to score one run an inning, so seven runs a game. What we’ve been working on is getting the leadoff hitter on base and then bunting her over. And then the next batter is going to hit behind her and score her and we’re going to continue doing that.”</p>\n<p>For the Gauchos, Wisdom will also be given the pitching responsibilities. She ranks second in innings pitched in the Big West this season and has an ERA of 3.20. As a staff, Santa Barbara holds the second-best strikeout-to-walk ratio in the conference at 1.6.</p>\n<p>“I’m working on throwing more strikes and spinning the ball,” Wisdom said. “Last weekend, I couldn’t find the strike zone, so what I need to do is find the umpire’s strike zone and pitch to the umpire’s strikes and not what I think the strike zone is.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play in a double-header Saturday before finishing off the series Sunday. Game one is set for Saturday at noon at Matador Diamond.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 7 of April 10, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>“It’s the blue-green rivalry and the second week of conference, and I’m mostly proud of how they came back after we basically got it handed to us the first game,” Head Coach Brie Galicinao said. “They made the choice to come back, compete and fight back.”</p>\n<p>With the series victory, the Gauchos improve to 23-16 overall and 3-3 in conference. The Mustangs drop to 21-14 overall and 3-3 in the Big West. Both Santa Barbara and Cal Poly move into a three-way tie for fourth place in the conference standings, along with Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p>In yesterday’s rubber match, UCSB earned the 2-1 victory thanks to two runs from freshman leftfielder Kristen Clark. In a game that featured just seven hits combined from both teams, the Gauchos crossed home plate first in the opening inning when sophomore catcher MeShalon Moore hit a sacrifice fly to bring Clark home.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly responded in the second inning, but Santa Barbara broke the stalemate in the fifth inning to score the winning run. Clark advanced to first base on a fielder’s choice to third base before stealing second. Then, junior right fielder DeJanee Moore floated the ball just over the head of the first baseman to score Clark and give UCSB the series victory 2-1.</p>\n<p>“We had better quality at bats,” Galicinao said. “We only had three hits, so it was a matter of working longer at bats and forcing the pitcher to throw more pitches. We had a few walks and got a couple key hits, and that’s what it takes in our game sometimes. We were able to find a way to push them across. It was enough.”</p>\n<p>Junior pitcher Shelby Wisdom earned the victory in the circle, improving to 11-11 on the year. While reigning Big West Pitcher of the Week freshman Sierra Hyland suffered the loss, dropping to 18-6, she gave up just three hits and struck out eight in her six innings of play.</p>\n<p>“[Hyland’s] good. Obviously she’s been doing a really good job,” Galicinao said. “As much as you don’t like having [her] against you, it’s also exciting to see a talent like that come through the ranks.”</p>\n<p>In game two of Saturday’s double-header, UCSB snapped a six-game losing streak that continued through game one, winning 2-0.</p>\n<p>Despite being outhit 7-5, the Gauchos took advantage of their opportunities offensively. Both runs came in the fourth inning due to poor defense from Cal Poly. MeShalon Moore walked, senior second baseman Kathryn Pilpil was hit by a pitch and senior first baseman Lauren Boser reached first base on an error.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Mustangs made a pitching change, but it did not matter. Freshman shortstop Emily Brucelas was walked to score Moore in the winning run of the day and sophomore leftfielder Jessica Tetzlaff singled, scoring Pilpil to secure the victory.</p>\n<p>Clark led the offense for Santa Barbara, hitting 3-4. Meanwhile, Wisdom earned the win in the circle, earning the shutout while striking out three.</p>\n<p>“[Saturday’s win] was really big,” Clark said. “We were feeling a little bit down and frustrated, but to come out and shut them down was really good for us and I think it carried into [yesterday] too.”</p>\n<p>Game one on Saturday was a completely different story. Falling 14-1, UCSB failed to contain a Cal Poly squad known more for its defense than its offense.</p>\n<p>Eleven different Mustangs scored runs as Cal Poly scored at least one run in six of the seven innings, capped off by six runs in the seventh.

We couldn’t hit strikes and we were swinging at balls.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos’ lone run of the day came from Boser in the fourth. With her on first base, DeJanee Moore doubled to left-center, which was enough to bring Boser over home plate.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s young phenom earned the win in the circle, as Hyland allowed just one run on three hits and struck out seven batters in her five innings of play.</p>\n<p>“It felt like everything went to them and nothing was working our way,” Clark said. “We got all their best in that game.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will be on the road the next two weekends, taking on Cal State Northridge next weekend.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of April 7, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54681\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54681\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-04-07/ucsb-comes-atop-blue-green-rivalry/","id":1054,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1053,1052,1051],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Rival Cal Poly, Try to Snap Losing Streak","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Softball","publish_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_DustinHarris.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Softball_DustinHarris.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Entering this weekend, the Gauchos have lost five straight games.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>All it takes is one loss to cause a slippery slope for any team.</p>\n<p>After getting off to its best start in program history, the UCSB softball team dropped another game yesterday, falling 8-1 to Oregon State.</p>\n<p>The loss marks the fifth straight for the Gauchos, which drop to 21-15 overall while remaining 1-2 in Big West play.

After putting two runs on the board in the first inning, the Ducks scored three runs off of two singles and four walks. They then capped off the inning with a grand slam from senior first baseman Kailee Cuico.</p>\n<p>Down by a large margin in the third, Wisdom homered with two outs to left field, scoring Pilpil and Clark.</p>\n<p>With the deficit still at six runs, UCSB’s comeback came up short. Both teams scored one more run, the Ducks in the sixth inning and the Gauchos in the seventh, but Santa Barbara couldn’t find the offense to avoid its second loss of the day 10-4.</p>\n<p>After falling behind early, UCSB outplayed Oregon the second half of the game. Sophomore pitcher Ashley Ludlow anchored the Gauchos defensively, giving up just two hits and striking out four in her 4.2 innings of play. On the offensive end, Santa Barbara outscored Oregon 4-1 after the second inning.</p>\n<p>Offensively, six different players scored for the Ducks. Leading Oregon were Ceo and Cuico. Ceo hit 2-2 with two runs and one RBI while Cuico recorded one run and five RBI on 2-2 hitting.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara continues its break from conference play and road trip in Oregon tomorrow when it travels to take on Oregon State.

Tied at seven apiece after four innings of play, the Titans put the game away in the sixth inning when sophomore second baseman Samantha Galarza hit a grand slam to left centerfield.</p>\n<p>“They’re a great hitting team, so I’m disappointed in myself for them hitting that home run,” Wisdom said. “The only thing I could think was that we still had two innings to score some more runs, but we couldn’t string hits again. Our offense wasn’t fully there the last two games.”</p>\n<p>One of the four scoring runs was that of sophomore third baseman Missy Taukeiaho. She finished the day hitting 2-2 with two runs and four RBI, bringing her series total to an outstanding 6-8, five runs and nine RBI.</p>\n<p>Leading UCSB on the offensive end were Wisdom, who hit 2-4 with one run and three RBI, and senior first baseman Lauren Boser, who went 2-3 with one run and one RBI.</p>\n<p>The offensive momentum Fullerton entered yesterday’s game with stems from game two of Saturday’s doubleheader, in which the Titans crushed the Gauchos 10-0. Ended in the fifth inning with the mercy rule, none of UCSB’s pitchers could find a rhythm.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning, Fullerton took control, scoring seven runs in the first inning. On the game, eight different Titans scored with Taukeiaho scoring at will. She was involved in seven of Fullerton’s 10 runs, hitting 3-3 with two runs and five RBI.</p>\n<p>“We couldn’t hit that game. We couldn’t figure out the pitcher,” Wisdom said. “That’s one thing we need to work on. Not everything is going to go our way and we need to fight back harder.”</p>\n<p>Game one of the series showed a very different Santa Barbara team as the Gauchos earned the 6-1 victory.</p>\n<p>With the score tied at one entering the sixth, UCSB scored five runs in the final two innings on two home runs. Freshman shortstop Emily Brucelas brought in two runs in the sixth with her homer to left centerfield and Boser followed suit one inning later, hitting a three-run homer to the same area to seal the game.</p>\n<p>“We out-hit them and our defense was great,” Wisdom said. “Once we scored that first run, we kept scoring. Hits are contagious.”</p>\n<p>Boser led UCSB offensively, hitting 2-3 with one run and one RBI. In the circle for Santa Barbara, Wisdom gave up just three hits while striking out four in her 11th complete game of the season. She also contributed on the offensive end, going 2-4 with three RBI.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continue play Tuesday when they take on Oregon in a double-header. Game one is slated to begin at 3 p.m.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared in March 31, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Dustin Harris of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54503\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/ucsb-drops-opening-conference-series/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54503\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/ucsb-drops-opening-conference-series/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/ucsb-drops-opening-conference-series/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/ucsb-drops-opening-conference-series/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-31/ucsb-drops-opening-conference-series/","id":109,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[108,107,106],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops One-Point Thriller to UC Davis","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos' season comes to an end after a 58-57 loss to the Aggies","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In a one-point decision, it’s easy to point fingers at all the different factors that could have changed the outcome.</p>\n<p>It would be easy to blame UCSB’s poor shooting in the first half as it shot a dismal 28 percent from the field, resulting in a 17-point halftime deficit.</p>\n<p>It would be even easier to shoulder the guilt on Head Coach Carlene Mitchell for picking up her first technical foul of her career with 65 seconds to go in the game.

Despite an incredible second-half comeback, the fact of the matter remains that the UCSB women’s basketball team lost 58-57 to UC Davis in the first round of the Big West Tournament tonight and its season is done.</p>\n<p>“I’m extremely proud of this team,” Mitchell said. “That was not an 8-22 team that just ended those last 20 minutes.”</p>\n<p>All season long, the thorn in Santa Barbara’s side has been consistency. 20 minutes of solid basketball isn’t enough and it came back to bite the eighth-seed Gauchos.</p>\n<p>After starting the game 3-7 from the field, UCSB began settling for too many jumpers against the Aggies’ zone defense. With the score tied at nine, Davis went on a 12-0 run, which was extended to 19 points with less than a minute to go before halftime. After its solid start, Santa Barbara shot just 5-23 the rest of the half.</p>\n<p>“100 percent [it was a matter of settling for too many jumpers],” Mitchell said. “I think once one or two didn’t fall, they continued to show that we could get in a flow with the jumpers.”</p>\n<p>Coming out of the locker rooms down 35-18, the Gauchos mounted a comeback. Led by the three seniors, guards Nicole Nesbit, Melissa Zornig and Destini Mason, the lead was chopped to four points with 13:10 to go.</p>\n<p>“It were no x’s and o’s (at halftime),” Mitchell said. “I just told them that actions speak louder than words. You can look in people’s eyes sometimes and know whether they’re going to come back out and battle or whether they’re ready to call it quits. Not once this year have these guys ever given in.”</p>\n<p>Play on both ends of the floor was nearly flawless. While UCSB has struggled this season defensively at times, any team under Mitchell prides itself on its defense. Using its press, Santa Barbara forced the Aggies into 11 second-half turnovers, which resulted in 24 points on the other end. In total, the Gauchos held UCD to 23 points in the final 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>“Our focus is always defense,” Zornig said. “Coach Mitch told us not to worry about the scoring and just to focus on the defense. In the second half, we came out with so much energy. We pressed them and trapped them and caused them to force turnovers. Our defense got us back in the game.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were also aided by the fact that sophomore forward Alyson Doherty went down with an injury approximately midway through the second half. She was unable to return after posting 14 points.</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB tallied 39 second-half points, shooting a phenomenal 60.7 percent from the field by attacking and getting to the rim. All season long, the seniors have put the team on their backs, but they took the saying to a new level last night, totaling every single point Santa Barbara scored in the second half.</p>\n<p>Zornig led the team with 21 points on 9-15 shooting while Mason added 16 points on 8-13 shooting. Nesbit also contributed 16 points.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been talking about how it’s March Madness. It’s one and done,” Nesbit said. “Unfortunately, it took us until the second half to get that run going, but we knew that if we didn’t give it all we had, we’d be going home.”</p>\n<p>With just under two minutes to play, Davis’ lead had been sliced to one at 56-55 by a layup from Mason in transition.</p>\n<p>“[It] was a really exciting basketball game,” UC Davis Head Coach Jennifer Gross said. “I thought we came our tremendously in the first half with great energy, executed offensively and played some of the best defense we’ve played this year, but we knew Santa Barbara wasn’t going away. They have tremendous players. I wasn’t surprised when they got it going.”</p>\n<p>However, with 65 seconds left, Zornig was called for an offensive foul. Mitchell, a coach not known for jabbing at the referees, immediately headed toward the nearest official. She was immediately given a technical foul, which resulted in two free throws for Davis on the other end, both of which were converted.</p>\n<p>“I’m disappointed for the seniors that they had to go out this way. I’ve already apologized to them,” Mitchell said. “It’s something I can’t take back; I can’t give them another game. Would we have won? I don’t know. I think at some point, you want the players to know you have their back and I just voiced it too loud in a critical moment in the game.”</p>\n<p>Rather than trying to tie the game with a three, Nesbit attacked, making a layup to bring the game within one once again at 58-57. On the other end, Santa Barbara earned the stop it needed defensively, causing a 30 second shot clock violation on Davis, but that left UCSB with just 4.0 seconds.</p>\n<p>Needing to go the length of the court, the Gauchos found their quickest player, Jemerigbe. In the short amount of time remaining, Jemerigbe was able to get all the way to the right elbow before she was forced to throw up the runner. It bounced off the back of the iron, sending UCSB home.</p>\n<p>“They did a good job trying to deny Nic and Mel,” Mitchell said. “We were trying to get it across half court and [run] a quick play. It is what it is and it’s never the last play that wins or loses the game.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara ends its season at 8-22 overall and 3-14 in Big West play. UC Davis, meanwhile, improves to 15-15 overall and will play UC Irvine in the quarterfinals tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“I can’t say enough about their players. Their seniors in particular were exceptional tonight,” Gross said. “We beat a very, very good basketball team tonight. The records don’t show a whole lot in our conference. Whether you have three or ten losses, every game is a battle. We knew regardless of record, we were playing a tough team today.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54449\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54449\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-11/ucsb-drops-one-point-thriller-to-uc-davis/","id":520,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[519,518,517],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Set for Postseason Play","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB takes on UC Davis in the first round of the Big West Tournament","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has nothing to lose.</p>\n<p>When the eighth seed Gauchos travel to Long Beach State tomorrow where they will take on fifth seed UC Davis in the first round of the Big West Tournament, Santa Barbara isn’t expected to win.</p>\n<p>They’ve had a disappointing season, finishing the year at 8-20 overall and 3-13 in the Big West.

If UC Riverside had beat Long Beach Saturday, the Gauchos’ season would be over.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Santa Barbara, it is playing in the postseason and records no longer matter.</p>\n<p>“I think everyone’s really excited,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “The first thing [Head Coach Carlene Mitchell] told us today when we walked into film was that we’re 0-0. Whatever happened during the regular season doesn’t matter now. We’re ready to make a run and upset teams.”</p>\n<p>Going into the Big West Tournament as the last seed makes the Gauchos the major underdogs, and that’s how they like it.</p>\n<p>The situation is reminiscent to two years ago when UCSB entered the conference tournament as the sixth seed. The team caught fire, winning the Big West Tournament and punching its ticket to the NCAA Tournament.</p>\n<p>“The kids know we have an uphill battle, but they also saw what USC did this past week,” Mitchell said. “We’ve been a low seed before and won games to get to the NCAA (Tournament). It’s March Madness and it’s called that for a reason.”</p>\n<p>But before Santa Barbara can think too far ahead, it has to take care of the task at hand. Tonight, that’s beating UC Davis.</p>\n<p>Both teams head to Long Beach with their final games of the regular season resulting in losses. The Aggies fell to UC Irvine Saturday while the Gauchos lost to rival Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB played very well against the Mustangs, which will take the second seed in the Tournament. If Santa Barbara takes the intensity it had Saturday to Long Beach tomorrow, the Gauchos could upset a lot of teams.</p>\n<p>The reason UCSB came out with the loss Saturday was defensive breakdowns down the stretch. The Gauchos gave Cal Poly’s outside shooters too much space and the Mustangs took advantage. Elegado hit two in the final minutes to clinch the game, recording a career-high 32 points on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>While UCSB played a solid game Saturday, the defensive breakdowns speak to Santa Barbara’s struggles all year long. Offense is not causing losses. Unlike in years prior where scoring was tough, this year it’s the defensive lapses and lack of consistency that put the Gauchos in the bottom of the standings.</p>\n<p>“We always focus on defense,” Zornig said. “We’ve been playing a lot of zone lately, but we’re going to mix it up. We just have to play disciplined.”</p>\n<p>In their two meetings with the Aggies this year, the Gauchos failed to put together more than 20 minutes of good basketball. In the first meeting in Davis, UCSB played well in the first half, but fell apart in the second, allowing UCD to shoot 41.7 percent from three point range. In the more recent matchup, Santa Barbara didn’t come to play, going down 15-2 to start the game. Davis shot 56 percent in the first half before the Gauchos played the Aggies even in the second half.</p>\n<p>“It’s the defensive side of things (that matter),” Mitchell said. “We have to do a better job on our post defense because they went at us all night long. We may mix it up like we did with Poly and see if it helps change the outcome.”</p>\n<p>The matchup of the game tomorrow will be down low with junior center Clair Watkins versus sophomore forward Alyson Doherty. Doherty averages 13.1 points per game, shooting a league-leading 55.7 percent from the field. Against the Gauchos, she’s upped her production, averaging 19 points in the two meetings.</p>\n<p>But as of late, UCSB also has a post presence inside in Watkins. The last five games, Watkins has nearly averaged a double-double at 10 points and 9.2 rebounds. Against Cal Poly, she held last year’s Big West Player of the Year, senior center Molly Schlemer, to 13 points. Meanwhile, Watkins tallied superior numbers at 16 points and 12 rebounds. While Santa Barbara is a guard-driven team, its success depends on Watkins.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to try to take the momentum I got in the Cal Poly game and try to carry it into the Davis game,” Watkins said. “[Doherty] had a good game here when they played us, but I think we’re all ready. It comes down to post defense for me.”</p>\n<p>The other player UCSB will keep an eye on is junior forward Sydnee Fipps. Named an All-Big West first team member today, Fipps ranks third in the conference in scoring at 17.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>As a result, UCSB may pull a triangle-and-two defense out of its pocket. Led by Doherty and Fipps, the Aggies rank first in field goal percentage, shooting an impressive 42.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gauchos aren’t far behind in that category, shooting 41.1 percent.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to beat a team three times,” Watkins said. “We’ve learned a lot from playing them twice. We know their go-to players, their moves and what they want to do on offense and defense, so hopefully we can learn and apply it and finally get a win against them.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 6 p.m. at Walter Pyramid.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

We had some shining moments and some scary moments.”</p>\n<p>Despite playing arguably their best game of the year, the Gauchos drop to 3-13 in the Big West and 8-21 overall. Cal Poly, on the other hand, improves to 11-5 in conference and 17-12 overall, clinching the second seed in the Big West Tournament. The loss is the seventh straight to the Mustangs.</p>\n<p>With the regular season done, UCSB now waits on the UC Riverside game tonight at 7 p.m., which will determine if the Gauchos go to the Big West Tournament. Hosting Long Beach, the Gauchos need Riverside to lose as the Highlanders own the tiebreaker.</p>\n<p>“We’ll just pray that the basketball gods are with the Gauchos and they know we still haven’t played our best basketball yet,” Mitchell said. “There’s a game later tonight that controls our destiny and that’s unfortunate.”</p>\n<p>A back and forth game the entirety of the contest, Santa Barbara took a 58-57 lead with 7:13 remaining off a layup from senior guard Destini Mason. However, the lead would be short-lived as Cal Poly’s league-leading offense took over.</p>\n<p>While the Mustangs shot just 8-24 from three-point range, Cal Poly drained three triples down the stretch, two coming from Elegado. On the game, Elegado shot 11-22 from the field, including 6-13 from downtown.</p>\n<p>“There were communication breakdowns. We tried to mix it up more than normal, so maybe our kids weren’t as comfortable,” Mitchell said. “Late in the game, [Elegado] knocked down two critical threes and pretty much sealed the game. A great player like that, you give her an inch and she’s going to knock it down. She willed her team to a win today.”</p>\n<p>While Elegado erupted on the offensive end, UCSB did a solid job on 6’5’’ star Molly Schlemer. The Gauchos held Schlemer to 13 points and 10 rebounds, compared to her 37 point, 15 rebound performance in San Luis Obispo.</p>\n<p>In fact, junior center Clair Watkins outplayed Schlemer, tallying a double-double on a career-high 16 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Cal Poly’s a big rivalry game and Schlemer had quite a few points last game,” Watkins said. “I just wanted to come out here and help my teammates and seniors and prove that UCSB can definitely hang with Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Santa Barbara actually outshot Cal Poly 43.7 percent to 39.7 percent, but was unable to get key defensive stops down the stretch.</p>\n<p>Along with Watkins, all three seniors finished in double-figures on senior day. Mason also tallied a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“It was difficult (playing on senior day),” Mason said. “It was very emotional, but I tried to look past it and be like. ‘It’s a normal game.’ But everyone comes to you and says ‘it’s your senior day,’ so you can’t ignore it. You have to embrace it.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB earns the final spot into the conference tournament, it will play next Tuesday at Long Beach State against the fifth seed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54430\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54430\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-08/ucsb-drops-seventh-straight-to-cal-poly/","id":515,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[514,513,512],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Stumbles in Hawaii","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos drop a 73-60 decision to the Rainbow Wahine","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>This season, there has been one statistic that seems to determine wins versus losses for the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>In the rebounding column, the Gauchos average 39.9 rebounds in victories compared to 32.0 boards in defeats.</p>\n<p>Last night in Hawaii, Santa Barbara was outrebounded 38-25, including 17-8 on the offensive boards, which led to 25-7 disadvantage in second chance points.

At the end of the day, it was the rebounding side of things.”</p>\n<p>The Rainbow Wahine improve to 16-11 and 10-5 in the Big West, moving into a tie for second place with Cal Poly. UCSB on the other hand, falls to 8-20 overall and 3-12 in conference.</p>\n<p>With Riverside losing to UC Davis last night, the Gauchos continue to hold onto the eighth and final playoff spot by a one-game margin.</p>\n<p>Tied at 13 all with 11:43 to go in the first half, the Rainbow Wahine went on an 11-0 run sparked by offensive boards. With 11 offensive rebounds in the first half, four of those 11 points were scored on rebound putbacks. Control of the game remained in Hawaii’s hands the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>“I think we had a lot of miscommunications on defense, but the main reason (for their run) was the rebounding,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We played zone most of the game and I think we had problems finding people to box out.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii continued to stand up to its ranking as the top defensive team in the Big West, holding UCSB to just 21 points in the first half. The Rainbow Wahine also lead the league in rebounding margin, which they exemplified tonight, outrebounding UCSB 22-10 in the first half, creating the separation that would last the entirety of the contest.</p>\n<p>With leading scorer and rebounder Kamilah Martin on the bench due to injury, other players stepped up offensively for the Rainbow Wahine. Four players finished in double figures with senior forward Diane Moore and junior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana leading Hawaii with 17 points apiece, which is a career-high for Moore.</p>\n<p>“They’ve played four games without [Jackson], so it’s not like this was their first game,” Mitchell said. “Because of their style of play, they’re not making any major adjustments. They do such a great job of having a balanced attack, so they don’t just rely on one player.”</p>\n<p>The biggest bright spot to take away from last night’s game for UCSB was the play of Zornig, who tallied a game- and career-high 28 points and six rebounds on 11-20 shooting.</p>\n<p>“She was just aggressive and took good shots,” Mitchell said. “She was able to attack off of the dribble and has played that way the entire year. I’m extremely proud of her and her growth and maturity.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos fly home today and will need to prepare quickly for Cal Poly Saturday for senior day. Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54413\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54413\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-07/ucsb-stumbles-in-hawaii/","id":511,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[510,509,508],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB-Cal Poly Showdown Set for Tomorrow","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The Gauchos take on the Mustangs on senior day","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The makings for a storybook ending are set for the UCSB women’s basketball team.</p>\n<p>It will be senior day.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos can also clinch the eighth and final playoff spot with a victory. A season where Santa Barbara has struggled, a win would send UCSB into the Big West Tournament with momentum.</p>\n<p>And to top it all off, the Gauchos are facing rival Cal Poly, a team Head Coach Mitchell has yet to beat since arriving in Santa Barbara almost three years ago. Only the three seniors know the feeling of winning a Blue-Green rivalry game as they beat the Mustangs March 5, 2011 to become co-champions of the Big West.</p>\n<p>Now all the team has to do is win.</p>\n<p>“These players dictate if we’re going to have five games,” Mitchell said. “They have to know that myself and this coaching staff believe as we have from day one. It has to be a positive energy going into Cal Poly.”</p>\n<p>But beating Cal Poly is much more easily said than done.</p>\n<p>UCSB enters tomorrow’s game the underdog with an overall record of 8-20 and a conference mark of 3-12. The Gauchos hold a one-game lead over UC Riverside, which plays Long Beach in its final game. The first time those two teams played, the Highlanders lost 65-52.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly, on the other hand, comes to the Thunderdome in a tie for second place in the Big West standings at 16-12 overall and 10-5 in conference. While the Mustangs seemed invincible to start the season, they have struggled of late, losing four of their last six.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly will also be well-rested since it had a buy yesterday. Santa Barbara, however, will have to bounce back quickly from a red-eye flight home after a 73-60 loss in Hawaii last night. The Gauchos were outrebounded 38-25, including 17-8 on the offensive boards, which resulted in a 25-7 second chance points disadvantage.</p>\n<p>“Coach Mitch always tells us after a loss, ‘you have until midnight and then you have to forget about it and move on to the next one,’” Zornig said. “We just have to forget about this one and go in ready to play. Cal Poly is a good team and they’re our rivals, so it’s about time we get a win against them.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding will once again be crucial tomorrow. Not only is it the biggest statistical difference in the win-loss column for the Gauchos, but the Mustangs lead the Big West in rebounding, grabbing 44.4 per game. UCSB ranks last at 34.0 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Yet, before Santa Barbara can rebound, it will have to play solid defense and force Cal Poly into some bad shots. A team that wins on the offensive end, the Mustangs top the conference in scoring at 77.1 points per game.</p>\n<p>Cal Poly’s biggest target offensively is last year’s Big West Player of the year Molly Schlemer. The senior center averages 17.3 points per game, leads the Big West in field goal percentage at 55.2 percent and ranks second in rebounding, pulling down 10.4 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Clearing out the middle for Schlemer is three-point threat and junior guard Ariana Elegado. Elegado ranks right behind Schlemer in scoring in the Big West, putting up a fifth-best 16.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>“I think the biggest key will be our defense,” Zornig said. “They have Schlemer inside, who’s a beast in there, and then they have really good outside shooters, so we just have to have a lot of communication on defense.”</p>\n<p>The last time these two teams met up in San Luis Obispo for the first Big West game of the year, the Mustangs were victorious thanks to their star duo. Schemer scored a career-high 37 points on 16-20 shooting along with 15 rebounds while Elegado hit big threes for Cal Poly, recording 30 points. Combining for 67 points, Schlemer and Elegado tallied just three points less than the entire UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>Trying to slow down the 6’5’’ Schlemer inside will be 6’4’’ junior center Clair Watkins. Although Watkins struggled in Hawaii, she is a very different player than when Cal Poly last saw her. Before the Hawaii game, Watkins had caught fire, averaging a double-double in the three previous games.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re better than the first time we played them, but we will use any combination of defenses we need to to hopefully limit [Schlemer],” Mitchell said. “But it’s not a one player show. They have great guards.

Hawaii currently holds the third seed in the Big West at 15-11 overall and 9-5 in conference. For UCSB, a win would go a long way in securing the eighth seed and ensuring it controls its own destiny.</p>\n<p>“We’re trying not to think about [the playoffs],” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We’re just trying to play one game at a time and focus on us. We’re focused on our next game: going to Hawaii and beating them at their place.”</p>\n<p>Hawaii holds the biggest home court advantage in the league with a five-and-a-half hour flight and a two-hour time zone difference separating it from every other Big West team. The Rainbow Wahine are 10-3 at home, including 6-1 during Big West play, with their only home loss coming to Cal Poly.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB knows the feeling of victory in Hawaii, defeating the Rainbow Wahine last season on their home court.</p>\n<p>Earlier this season, Santa Barbara nearly came away with the victory in Thunderdome, falling 63-60. Hawaii shot 22-24 from the free throw line, including 19-20 in the second half, compared to 3-6 for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Even then, UCSB held a lead in the final period until the Rainbow Wahine went to star senior forward Kamilah Jackson, who scored six straight points to give Hawaii a three-point lead with under a minute to go.</p>\n<p>“[From that game, we take] learning how to close games out,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We’re pretty good for long stretches, but it came down to the last four minutes where a couple things fell apart. We have to learn how to win.”</p>\n<p>Jackson continues to lead Hawaii offensively, averaging 15.5 points and 9.7 rebounds while shooting 50.4 percent from the field. However, Jackson has not played in the last four games after suffering a foot injury against UC Riverside Feb. 13. It is unknown whether she will suit up tonight.</p>\n<p>In Jackson’s absence, the Rainbow Wahine have still been solid, going 3-1. Stepping up have been senior guard Shawna-Lei Keuhu, who leads the team in scoring during conference play with 12.2 points per game and scored a team-high 15 points in the Thunderdome, and junior guard Ashleigh Karaitiana, who averages 10.2 points per game. A big, physical team known for playing four power forwards and a point guard, Hawaii has plenty of options.</p>\n<p>“It’s obvious they’ve found other players to step up and they’re winning without [Jackson],” Mitchell said. “She is a big-time player, but you can’t just focus on her. It won’t change our game plan at all [if she doesn’t play].”</p>\n<p>On the other end, the big emerging player for UCSB has been junior center Clair Watkins, who is a very different player than when Hawaii last saw her. In her last three games, Watkins has averaged a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“[Clair’s] major,” Mitchell said. “I know that. She knows that. We need her to get the paint and score.”</p>\n<p>Yet don’t expect an offensive battle tonight as both teams are very defensive minded. Under Mitchell, the Gauchos have been a team that prides itself on its defense and the Rainbow Wahine currently lead the Big West in scoring defense, holding teams to 60.7 points during conference play.</p>\n<p>“First of all, [the fact that they’re in first] frustrates me because that should be us and it was us in the past,” Mitchell said. “They’re big, they’re strong and they’re physical. I tell our team, ‘it’s a compliment — they play like old ladies.’ They don’t beat themselves. They make the right decisions, and they do all the blue-collar things that allow them to be where they’re at in the conference standings.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 9 p.m. Pacific Time at Stan Sheriff Center.</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of March 6th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54395\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54395\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/gauchos-fighting-for-life-in-the-postseason/","id":510,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[509,508,507],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Falls to UCD in Play for Kay Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WBasketball_Cameryn_Brock.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WBasketball_Cameryn_Brock.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB remains in eighth place in the Big West standings despite a loss to UC Davis on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Slow starts are very difficult to recover from in the game of basketball.

Offensively, UCSB failed to find an offensive rhythm against the Aggies’ zone defense, turning the ball over nine times and taking poor quality shots. In the first half, the Gauchos shot 39.3 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“They were changing up their defense. We haven’t seen a 3-2 [zone] yet this year,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We were trying different things, but we had a lot of unforced turnovers. We were just playing scared. We weren’t attacking like we normally do. We settled for jump shots. Our game is to attack and if we don’t attack, we struggle.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, Santa Barbara struggled to contain the bigger, stronger Davis team. The Aggies got into the lane with ease and each time UCSB did get the game into single digits, the team couldn’t earn the critical defensive stop.</p>\n<p>Davis shot 56 percent from the field in the first half and outscored UCSB 14-4 in the paint. On the game, the Aggies also outrebounded the Gauchos 41-34.</p>\n<p>“Some of them were just straight line drives,” Mitchell said. “When they’re a great three point shooting team, it stretches your man defense, and the so the weak-side help was slower getting there than it typically would be.”</p>\n<p>After going down by 13 just over five minutes into the game, the lead was extended to 18 points late in the first half.</p>\n<p>Opening the second half down by 14, the Gauchos played UC Davis virtually even at 26-24. In fact, Santa Barbara had the momentum with 7:28 remaining when UCSB completed a 7-2 run to bring the gap to 13 points, but approximately 10 seconds later, junior center Clair Watkins fouled out, sparking a 13-4 run for Davis.</p>\n<p>“The big run early set the tone,” Mitchell said. “We’d get [the lead] down to 10, 11 or 12 and couldn’t get it below double figures.”</p>\n<p>Watkins finished the afternoon with 11 points while Zornig led the team with 12 points and three assists on 5-10 shooting. While Watkins and Zornig combined for 10-21 from the field, the rest of the team struggled, going 10-41.</p>\n<p>With the loss, the Gauchos fall to 8-19 overall and 3-11 in conference with just two games remaining. Nevertheless, with UC Riverside falling to Cal State Northridge, Santa Barbara maintains a one-game lead for the eighth and final playoff spot. UC Davis improves to an overall mark of 13-14 and 8-6 in conference.</p>\n<p>“We control our own destiny,” Mitchell said. “If you can win a road game [next week], that’s great, and you come home and a lot of things can happen on senior day.”</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its final two games of the regular season next week, traveling to Hawaii Thursday before returning home for Cal Poly on Saturday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 9 of March 3, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Cameryn Brock of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54304\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-falls-to-ucd-in-play-for-kay-game/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54304\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-falls-to-ucd-in-play-for-kay-game/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-falls-to-ucd-in-play-for-kay-game/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-falls-to-ucd-in-play-for-kay-game/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-03-02/ucsb-falls-to-ucd-in-play-for-kay-game/","id":549,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[548,547,546],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Host Anteaters After Snapping Skid","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-14_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.13.2014.UCSB_.Womens.Basketball.vs_.LBSU-14_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB sits in eighth place in the Big West and will try to win its second straight game Thursday night against Irvine.

We may look to double, and that’s just out of respect for what she can do when she gets the ball.”</p>\n<p>Following Buckley’s lead, the Anteaters rank second in the conference in scoring during league play at 73.6 points per game.</p>\n<p>Last time these two teams met up in Irvine, Buckley was the biggest reason her team came away with the 77-60 victory. Buckley was dominant, scoring 27 points on 7-12 shooting, including 13-15 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>She also grabbed 15 rebounds, aiding the Anteaters in winning the rebounding battle 43-28. Santa Barbara currently ranks last in the Big West in rebounding at just 33.9 boards on the season. The statistic carries significant weight in the win-loss column too, with the Gauchos getting 39.9 rebounds in wins compared to 31.1 in losses.</p>\n<p>“We have to make sure [Buckley] doesn’t touch it,” junior center Clair Watkins said. “That’d be the easiest way to make sure she doesn’t score. It’s going to be up to the post players to stay lower than her and be physical with her.”</p>\n<p>While UCSB will throw multiple defensive looks at Buckley, Watkins will earn plenty of time on the dominant senior. She comes off a solid weekend herself in which she earned her first double-double last Saturday in Santa Barbara’s win over Cal State Fullerton. She scored 10 points and tallied 15 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“Fullerton was more finesse and Clair had to guard guards and three-point shooters,” Mitchell said. “Now it’ll be a physical game, so I’ll be interested to see how she does because I think she’s understanding now that that’s what we have to have from her. That was the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Last weekend, the Gauchos split their games, losing to last-place UC Riverside in the team’s most devastating loss of the year before rebounding for a victory over Fullerton. While inconsistency continued to plague the Gauchos in Riverside, UCSB came out strong and sustained its energy for the entirety of the game.</p>\n<p>“We all were upset about the Riverside game, but we went into Fullerton with a chip on our shoulder and came out with a lot of energy,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “That’s what won us the game, so if we come with that same energy and mindset for Irvine, I think we should win the game.”</p>\n<p>With three of the team’s final games at home, Santa Barbara has the opportunity to try to improve its seed for the conference tournament. At 8-17 overall and 3-9 in the Big West, UCSB currently stands in the eighth and final playoff spot, 1.5 games up on UC Riverside. Fullerton sits in a three-way tie for fifth place at 13-13 overall and 6-6 in conference.</p>\n<p>“I think everyone’s still a little hurt from that Riverside game,” Watkins said. “That’s one we should’ve came away with fairly easily, but we have four games left. We have to get all of them. Each one counts more now than ever because we want to get into the tournament.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of February 27, 2014’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-54252\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-54252\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/gauchos-host-anteaters-after-snapping-skid/","id":544,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[543,542,541],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":2,"highestPage":15,"route":"/authors/71"}},"__N_SSG":true}
