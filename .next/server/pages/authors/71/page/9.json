The two combined for a total of 43 points, nearly outscoring Santa Barbara on their own.</p>\n<p>At 6’5’’, Schlemer took advantage of UCSB in the post, scoring a game-high 22 points on 11-15 shooting.</p>\n<p>“[Schlemer] finishes extremely well,” Mitchell said. “We made an adjustment to front her in the second half, but [you can’t] double her because everyone else can hit their shots. You have 6’5’’ going up against 6’1’’ and that’s a problem.”</p>\n<p>Griffin hurt the Gauchos from all over the court, tallying 21 points, including 3-4 from three-point range, nine rebounds, five assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>“I think [Griffin] got a lot of her points off of transition,” junior guard Melissa Zornig said. “She’s the type of girl that will pull up for three in transition.”</p>\n<p>The Mustangs were on fire right from the top, taking a 10-0 lead over Santa Barbara to start the game. However, the Gauchos stayed in the game by taking away Cal Poly’s transition game, heading into the locker room down 28-22.</p>\n<p>“We were getting easy shots, but they weren’t falling and that’s why we weren’t panicking,” Mitchell said. “We were making them work hard.”</p>\n<p>To begin the second half, though, Cal Poly dashed any hopes of a UCSB comeback, going on a 23-7 run fueled by transition baskets to take its largest lead of the game at 22 points. While there were still eight minutes remaining, the game was long over as UCSB was unable to get any closer than 15 points.</p>\n<p>“We’re getting better at executing, but we missed a lot of shots that we should’ve knocked down,” Zornig said.</p>\n<p>UCSB continues its three-game road trip on Thursday at Cal State Northridge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h6>A version of this article appeared on page 10 of January 22nd, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</h6>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49511\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-22/gauchos-fall-to-rival-mustangs-in-slo/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49511\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-22/gauchos-fall-to-rival-mustangs-in-slo/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-22/gauchos-fall-to-rival-mustangs-in-slo/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-22/gauchos-fall-to-rival-mustangs-in-slo/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-22/gauchos-fall-to-rival-mustangs-in-slo/","id":690,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[689,688,687],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Travels to Cal Poly for Heated Rivalry","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Beginning a three-game road trip this Saturday, the UCSB women’s basketball team could think of no better way to start that road trip than a win over rival Cal Poly.

In that game, the Mustangs shot 48.7 percent from the field and tallied 22 assists. Junior center Molly Schelmer scored a career-high 28 points while senior guard Kayla Griffin nearly tallied a triple-double with eight points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists and four steals.</p>\n<p>“It was the first game we watched the next day,” Mitchell said. “They just strike so quickly. They were up 20 points on Pacific in the first half and that’s going to be hard for a team like ourselves and our style of play to recover from that. We have to come out ready to play from the tip because if we bury ourselves into that deep of a hole, it will be a long night.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters the game with momentum as well, after a dominating 58-43 performance over UC Davis Saturday. Defensively, the Gauchos held the Aggies to 11 first-half points, the fourth lowest point total by an opponent in a half in the program’s history, while assisting 17 of their 20 field goals on the offensive end. Junior guard Melissa Zornig paced Santa Barbara offensively with a career-high 24 points.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also enter with an extra chip on their shoulder as Cal Poly won both matchups last year.</p>\n<p>However, Cal Poly is a very different team from last year, having lost to graduation Kristina Santiago, who compiled the most points in program history and led the Big West last year with 23.1 points and 10.1 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“On any given night, it’s a different person leading them in scoring,” Mitchell said. “They have a lot of experience and they’re just not going to and through one person this year.”</p>\n<p>As a team, the Mustangs want to score a lot and they want to score quickly. Often playing with a three guard lineup, they rank second in the Big West in both scoring offense and three point field goal percentage at 69.5 points per game and 33.8 percent, respectively. In addition, Cal Poly leads the conference in assists with 16.5 per game.</p>\n<p>“We know they want to get out and push the ball,” Mitchell said. “We can’t match them in points, so if we can slow them down and hopefully make them execute more in the half court, then we’ll have a shot to win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB would like to keep the score much lower and allow its defense to control the game as the Gauchos rank first in scoring defense, allowing teams just 55.2 points per game.</p>\n<p>“[Defense is] always our main focus,” Zornig said.“Defense is going to win games,so if we play our defense, then the offense will flow.”</p>\n<p>As a result, the tempo will likely decide which team comes out victorious.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to slow down the ball, whether it’s being taken out or rebounded,”senior forward Kirsten Tilleman said. “We usually send a lot of rebounders to the (offensive) glass, but we’re going to have to be a lot more aware of the leaking out.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, rebounding will be a very important key for UCSB. The Mustangs lead the Big West in rebounding at 42.5 per game, which allows them to jumpstart their fast break.</p>\n<p>Helping Santa Barbara on the boards will be two of the top rebounders in conference: Tilleman and senior forward Sweets Underwood. With Underwood ranking third in the Big West with 8.6 boards per game and Tilleman pulling down 6.5 rebounds per game, the Gauchos have become the best in the Big West in rebounding defense, holding their opponents to 33.4 boards per contest.</p>\n<p>However, with Cal Poly typically playing a smaller lineup, the Gauchos will need the guards to hit the glass as well.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 4 p.m. at Robert A.

UCSB took a quick 9-2 lead after a 7-0 run.</p>\n<p>“I think after the bad loss against Pacific we knew we had to come with some energy,” senior guard Angelei Aguirre said. “We had to come out with intensity if we were going to win this game because Davis is a very good team.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos held the Aggies to 11 points on 13 percent shooting in the first half. Davis’ halftime total will go down in UCSB record books as the fourth-fewest points scored by an opponent in a half.</p>\n<p>“It’s communication and discipline,” Mitchell said. “We understand that they run a system where there are a lot of backdoor hits and we took switches one through five.”</p>\n<p>As basketball is known for being a game of runs, Davis tried to narrow the gap to open the second half, using an 8-0 run to cut UCSB’s lead down to 10. However, the Gauchos responded with a 12-3 run of their own.</p>\n<p>The Aggies didn’t quit, though, using a 9-0 run to make the difference just 10 again with 5:24 to go, but Santa Barbara once again found an answer, sinking eight of its 10 free throw shots in the final two minutes.</p>\n<p>“I think we got together and knew we weren’t going to lose the game,” Aguirre said. “We buckled down, held each other accountable and got stops when we needed them.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB moved the ball quickly, passing through Davis’ infamous trapping defense. The Gauchos dished out 17 assists on its 20 field goal attempts and shot 45.5 percent from the field. Zornig and junior guard Nicole Nesbit tied for a team-high five assists.</p>\n<p>The 20 field goals marks the second-most for UCSB this season.</p>\n<p>“On the offensive side, I was extremely pleased with how we played,” Mitchell said. “The overall effort was there. I think by scoring 58 (points), we’re showing on the offensive end what we can do, whereas you might not have seen that until the last five games last year.”</p>\n<p>Zornig was the star for Santa Barbara offensively, but UCSB had many players contiribute in the victory. Aguirre scored nine points and grabbed eight rebounds and senior center Kirsten Tilleman tallied nine boards and a team-high two steals.</p>\n<p>“What [Tilleman] does for our team and the value she presents on both ends of the court, it’s never going to show up on the stat sheet — toughness, the ability to get key rebounds, and taking charges every game,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>While the Aggies lead the Big West in triples made per game with 7.1, Davis struggled from behind the arc, shooting 4-23.</p>\n<p>“A three for them is the same as a lay-up for most teams, so the game plan was to switch one through five,” Mitchell said. “Someone like Tilleman, Lei or Sweets was able to guard their point guard at times and did a great job, so it was about making them put it on the floor and we had great rotation on the weak side.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be next Saturday when the team takes on Cal Poly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 14th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49351\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49351\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-14/ucsb-snaps-twogame-losing-streak-uc-davis/","id":686,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[685,684,683],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Men’s Basketball: Cal State Northridge Matadors","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Last year, a young Cal State Northridge women’s basketball team surprised everyone, finishing second in the Big West.

The Matadors have taken on No. 21 Oklahoma, No. 8 Penn State and No. 14 UCLA.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s always about getting better,” Flowers said. “We felt like with the team we had, we had to challenge them early.”</p>\n<p>The UCLA game proved the potential of this young squad as the team beat the Bruins 77-72 on Dec. 20 at Pauley Pavilion. At the time, UCLA was ranked No. 12 in the nation.</p>\n<p>“[Our players] believed they could win and we got it done at both ends of the floor,” Flowers said. “It was great for our kids to get that experience and getting the win.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Matadors are four underclassmen. Two of the team’s sophomore guards, Janae Sharpe and Ashlee Guay, were predicted to make the all-conference team.</p>\n<p>Guay leads the team with 13.8 points per game, good enough for fifth in the Big West. She also ranks third in the Big West in assists and second in steals with 3.9 and 3.0, respectively.</p>\n<p>“Ashley’s been good for us,” Flowers said. “She’s a tough kid and she’s running the offense. She’s [also] the first line of the defense.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore center Camille Mahlknecht anchors the team inside, leading the conference in blocked shots with 2.4 per game and ranking fourth in rebounding, pulling down 8.6 boards per game.</p>\n<p>Finally, freshman forward Marta Masoni fills a weakness from last year’s team: threepoint shooting.

Currently, the Tigers have three players averaging double-digit scoring.</p>\n<p>“I think if you’re relying on one or two players and they have an off night, then you’re screwed,” Roberts said. “Thankfully, we’re lucky enough to have players where if one’s having an off night, we still can score.”</p>\n<p>Leading Pacific is senior forward Kendall Rodriguez, who was voted to finish on the all-conference team in the preseason media polls. She averages 12.5 points per game.</p>\n<p>Sophomore forward Kendall Kenyon averages a double-double with 11.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, the only player in the Big West to do so. She also ranks first in conference in field goal percentage at 56.8 percent and third in blocks with 1.5 per game.</p>\n<p>Another important key for the Tigers is senior guard Erica McKenzie. Not only does she average 9.5 points per game, but she ranks first in assists to turnover ratio at 1.8. McKenzie is also a threat from the outside, making 2.3 triples per game.</p>\n<p>Pacific next travels to Cal Poly Saturday.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><em>A version of this article appeared on page 5 of January 11th, 2013’s print edition of the Nexus.</em></span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49567\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/pacific-tigers/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49567\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/pacific-tigers/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/pacific-tigers/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/pacific-tigers/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-11/pacific-tigers/","id":685,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[684,683,682],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Lose in Big West Final Rematch","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It was the same matchup from last year’s Big­ West Championship game, but the result was different.

However, with approximately four minutes remaining, she fouled out, giving the 49ers momentum.</p>\n<p>“We challenged [Aguirre]; she’s got to be willing to accept the responsibility of being a senior,” Mitchell said. “She’s a physical player and has the ability to score in a variety of ways and she was able to do that in the second half.”</p>\n<p>Both teams traded baskets for the majority of the second half, but with just less than two minutes remaining and the score tied at 44, Long Beach State went on an 8-1 run, aided by UCSB turnovers.</p>\n<p>“We made a lot of critical mistakes at the end of the game,” Underwood said. “Long Beach is a good team and you can’t make critical mistakes in the end of the game and expect to win, so it’s on us.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos turned the ball over six more times than the 49ers, two coming in the final 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Nesbit scored a game-high 15 points. while Underwood contributed a double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play its first conference home game of the season this Thursday when the team takes on University of the Pacific.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 9 of January 7th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49199\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-lose-big-west-final-rematch/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49199\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-lose-big-west-final-rematch/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-lose-big-west-final-rematch/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-lose-big-west-final-rematch/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-01-07/gauchos-lose-big-west-final-rematch/","id":707,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[706,705,704],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Searching for Six","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The St. Mary’s women’s basketball team has never won a game in the Thunderdome and UCSB would like to keep it that way when it hosts the Gaels Saturday.

UCSB will also attempt to rebound from a tough loss to USC.</p>\n<p>“We need to earn our respect back and play harder and get back to the things that got us to the tournament last year, which was getting stops,” Aguirre said. “We didn’t do that against USC, so we need to get back to the defensive side of things. That’s our identity and at the end of the day, it’s [what] will win us games.”</p>\n<p>UCSB comes off a 62-51 loss against the Trojans in which a bad first half put Santa Barbara in a deep hole, going down by as many as 18 points in the second half. With 1:19 remaining, the Gauchos completed a 13-1 run and made the deficit just six points, but ran out of time to complete the comeback.</p>\n<p>“You’re at home; [consistency] shouldn’t even be a discussion,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “We’re a veteran team … it’s inexcusable for us to not be prepared against a Pac-12 team that we knew what they were going to do. You know not every shot is going to go in, but I expected our team to compete and I didn’t feel we did that for the first 20 minutes.”</p>\n<p>A major highlight of the game was the play of Aguirre, who tallied a career-high 13 points. Aguirre put the team on her back and scored 11 second half points. She is also second on the team in assists with 2.3 per game.</p>\n<p>“Yeah I had a career-high, but it doesn’t mean anything because we didn’t win,” Aguirre said. “It’s my senior year and I want to go out winning Big West, and I want to build up our resume so we’re not playing Baylor again first round. So for me, these are the wins that we need.”</p>\n<p>Consistency will be a key for UCSB against St. Mary’s. Last season, the Gauchos dominated the first half, outscoring the Gaels 35-14, but almost gave the game away by allowing 38 points in the second half. In the end, Santa Barbara prevailed 61- 52 and Mitchell earned her first victory as a head coach.</p>\n<p>Junior guard Nicole Nesbit led UCSB with 15 points last year against the Gaels. This season, Nesbit leads the team in points per game with 11. The Gaels feature two big offensive threats in juniors Jackie Nared and Danielle Mauldin. Nared, a 6’1’’ guard, leads the team with 18.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. Mauldin nearly averages a double-double with 12.8 points and 9.8 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll probably use some different bodies on [Nared] and I know we’ll have to go back to what we do best and that’s our man defense,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Senior center Kirsten Tilleman did not play against USC and is questionable for tomorrow’s game. As a result, the Gauchos could be without their leader and one of its top rebounders as Tilleman averages 7.4 boards per game.</p>\n<p>“She brings so much to the table, not just rebounding,” Aguirre said. “She does so many things for us that people don’t even know because they don’t make the stat sheet.”</p>\n<p>Without Tilleman, the entire team will need to focus on rebounding. The Gaels hit the boards, averaging 47.2 rebounds per game, nearly 16 rebounds more than the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>In addition, while defense is always a focal point for the Gauchos as they lead the Big West in scoring defense at 53.5 points per game, UCSB has lived and breathed defense in practice this week, especially after a poor performance against USC in which the Trojans shot 56.2 percent from downtown.</p>\n<p>“Today [Thursday] was an hour and 45 minutes of defense and rebounding, absolutely nothing else,” Mitchell said. “We went back and watched the entire clips of USC and the kids had to be embarrassed at the performance we had against USC in all facets of the game.”</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s currently averages 68.4 points per game compared to UCSB’s 52.2 points per game, so the defense will need to be in full force for the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. in the Thunderdome.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49178\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49178\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-30/gauchos-searching/","id":705,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[704,703,702],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Rally Falls Short Against Trojans","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team saw its toughest competition to date last night against Pac-12 opponent USC, which proved to be too much to handle as the Gauchos fell 62-51.

However, USC used excellent passing to find the open man on a Santa Barbara defense that typically ranks No. 20 nationally in three-point defense at 20.3 percent.</p>\n<p>“That’s not our personality to play a lot of zone,” Mitchell said. “They haven’t shot it extremely well in their first four games, so we thought we might mix it up a little bit more than usual.That’s always a chance you take.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos were especially undersized with their two centers, senior Kirsten Tilleman and freshman Jessica Pino, sitting on the sidelines with injuries.</p>\n<p>“Well I think it’s obvious [not having them] made a major impact,” Mitchell said. “Tilleman [averages] eight rebounds a game, so that put the burden on Lei and Sweets, who had to guard a powerful post presence on the low block.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB made the end interesting, bringing the game within just six points with 1:19 remaining. However, the Trojans answered with none other than a three-pointer, icing the game.</p>\n<p>“I felt we didn’t come out in the first half the way we needed to,” senior guard Angelei Aguirre said. “We needed to redeem ourselves and play hard [in the second half ].”</p>\n<p>To start the game, UCSB jumped out to an early 18-17 lead. However, USC put together a 20-4 run to end the first half and begin the second half to give the team a 37-22 lead.</p>\n<p>“They were taking a lot of switches in everything we were running with screen and rolls, which is a major part of our offense,” Mitchell said. “We didn’t recognize the times of mismatches and I think we hit the panic button a little too quickly, so sometimes we were taking quick shots and should’ve executed a little longer.”</p>\n<p>Aguirre and freshman forward Kendra Morrison led the charge with Morrison tallying 11 points on the game, all of which came in the second half. Aguirre put the team on her back in the final period, running the point and scoring 11 of her 13 points.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted to do anything I could to help us win and get back into the game, so I guess today that meant scoring points,” Aguirre said. “Any way I can help our team win is what I’m going to do.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be Saturday against St. Mary’s.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 5 of November 28th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49062\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49062\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-28/ucsb-rally-falls-short-trojans/","id":704,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[703,702,701],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Spends Thanksgiving in Mexico","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB might be heading to paradise for Thanksgiving break, but this trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico won’t be about sunbathing for the women’s basketball team as they play some tough competition in ...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB might be heading to paradise for Thanksgiving break, but this trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico won’t be about sunbathing for the women’s basketball team as they play some tough competition in the 2012 Hardwood Tournament of Hope, beginning with Oregon State today.</p>\n<p>“I’m very excited,” junior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We took one trip to New York my freshman year, which was awesome.

Despite taking a 12-point lead into the second half, the Gauchos found themselves up just two with five seconds remaining. Nevertheless, UCSB was able to close out the win.</p>\n<p>“We’ll take away closing games out when it’s really close,” Nesbit said. “At this point last season, we probably wouldn’t have been able to do that.”</p>\n<p>The greatest challenge for the Gauchos against the Beavers may turn out to be something UCSB has no control over: height. Oregon St. is a big team; the average height of its starting lineup is 6’0’’ compared to Santa Barbara’s 5’9’’.</p>\n<p>As a result, UCSB will need to keep Oregon St. out of the paint. The Beavers average 36 points in the paint per game.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re undersized just about every game,” Mitchell said. “Our defensive philosophy remains the same. The only way you can handle 6’4’’ is to full front them and pressure the ball.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding will be another focus point for UCSB as Oregon St. averages an incredible 50 rebounds per game.</p>\n<p>“[We have to] box them out … that’s the main thing,” senior forward Sweets Underwood said. “We have to really put a body on them, drive them back and secure each and every rebound.”</p>\n<p>Defensively, the Gauchos will keep a close eye on Oregon St. sharpshooter Alyssa Martin. The junior guard averages 18 points per game, shooting 44.4 percent from the field. She shoots an even higher percentage from behind the arc at 45.5 percent and has solidified herself as one of the best three-point shooters in the team’s history, ranking sixth all time in threes with 100.</p>\n<p>“She can shoot the three or can put it on the floor,” Mitchell said. “She finds a variety of ways to score, which for us, is probably going to be a matchup problem.”</p>\n<p>On the offensive end, UCSB will need to improve its execution against a zone, especially since the Beavers are known for their two-three zone. In UCSB’s last game against New Mexico St., the Gauchos were outscored 27-17 in the second half when the Aggies switched to a zone.</p>\n<p>“We know that’s probably our biggest weakness right now as a team,” Nesbit said. “We need to execute, not be afraid of the zone, be patient and attack.”</p>\n<p>Depending on today’s result, the Gauchos will face off against either Mississippi State or Winthrop tomorrow. Other teams in the tournament include Louisville, University of Central Florida, Gonzaga and Missouri State University.</p>\n<p>Tip-off against Oregon State is set for 11 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 20th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-49033\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-49033\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-20/ucsb-spends-thanksgiving-mexico/","id":702,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[701,700,699],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Ryan Takes the Reins","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In a season full of disappointment for the UCSB men’s soccer team, there was one major bright spot on the year: Nic Ryan. “I thought Nic Ryan had a breakout season,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg sai...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In a season full of disappointment for the UCSB men’s soccer team, there was one major bright spot on the year: Nic Ryan.</p>\n<p>“I thought Nic Ryan had a breakout season,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “He stepped up and was consistent.

Losing our forwards, it was huge to have someone to score goals for us.”</p>\n<p>Ryan seemed to come up with a goal whenever his team needed one. Against Cal Poly Oct. 19, he scored what may have been the most beautiful goal of the year for UCSB when he converted a diving header sent into the box from freshman midfielder Ema Boateng.</p>\n<p>He even single-handedly kept the Gauchos in the game on multiple occasions. Most notably, he scored both of UCSB’s goals in a 2-1 decision against UC Irvine Oct. 5, the second goal coming in double overtime with 24 seconds remaining.</p>\n<p>“Every goal he got was a key goal at a key moment,” Vom Steeg said. “You can’t ask for much more than what he gave us. I feel bad that we weren’t able to do enough to send [our seniors] off in a different away.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the San Jose native seemed to fly under the radar with the hype of the team centering on flashy players such as Boateng or senior midfielder Dion Acoff, who dazzled fans with their speed and footwork.</p>\n<p>Yet, that’s not the type of player Ryan is; he’s a player who effectively gets the job done. He knows where to be on the field, and most importantly, how to finish in front of the goal.</p>\n<p>“He understands the game really well and he knows where to be at the right time,” Baiden said. “It allowed him to get involved more and get himself in places that would score.”</p>\n<p>Despite being a player who hasn’t received a ton of publicity or made people talk, Ryan was recognized in a big way when he received the Big West Midfielder of the Year award last week.</p>\n<p>“It’s nice to get an award after a difficult season,” Ryan said. “It was definitely one of my goals to try to be the best midfielder out there and getting it felt like a [big] accomplishment. It’s definitely a big award, and I’m proud of it.”</p>\n<p>One of two players to play in every game this year for UCSB, Ryan tallied five goals and two assists during Big West play en route to his first All-Big West honor of his career.</p>\n<p>“In order to win that award, you have to play through the midfield, and we do that,” Vom Steeg said. “We ask them to be on the ball, and as a result, we allow them to really demonstrate what they can do. He seized the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Ryan keeps the Midfielder of the Year award in the family as he is the fourth consecutive Gaucho to win it. Danny Barrera took the honor in 2009-10 and Luis Silva won it last year.</p>\n<p>In fact, playing behind players such as Barrera, Silva and Sam Garza in the first three years of his career might be the reason you had never really heard Ryan’s name before.</p>\n<p>“I had really good players in front of me like Silva and Danny, so I had to let them do their thing,” Ryan said. “They had a lot of success. I knew I could have that role.”</p>\n<p>This year, the team needed somebody to step up and take the role of that dominant midfielder. It was a role Ryan wanted and took into his own hands.</p>\n<p>“It was definitely a change in mentality,” Ryan said. “I wanted to be that player to get the goal or the assist. This year, I felt like I was the guy — that one midfielder — that had to score for us to win.”</p>\n<p>This year, Ryan took 26 shots, 11 more than he took in his first three years combined. His 19 points are also exceptionally greater than his contribution in the first three years when he tallied just five points, including two goals.</p>\n<p>“He played with a lot of confidence this year,” Vom Steeg said. “That’s the most dramatic change from last year. Once we started to lose our forwards, he took it upon himself to score. I think there was a lot of leadership too. Even though he doesn’t scream and yell, he demanded the ball and stepped up his play in the bigger games.”</p>\n<p>UCSB also made a tactical change, moving Ryan into a central midfield position this year. The position was better suited for Ryan than his original outside mid position and gave him more scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>“Before I got to UCSB, I always played attacking mid, so I was comfortable with that role,” Ryan said. “Usually on the outside, you concentrate on getting the cross off and since I was in the middle [this year], I was in the box and receiving the ball at the end of the cross.”</p>\n<p>Now, Ryan’s season and career as a Gaucho are done. But like the great players who played at UCSB before him, there may be a spot for him at the pro level.</p>\n<p>For Ryan, going pro has been a lifelong dream. He’s strived for this goal all his life, as his dad was a professional soccer player (a midfielder) for the San Jose Earthquakes. At UCSB, Ryan wore No. 14, just like his dad.</p>\n<p>“[My dad’s] probably been the number one influence soccer-wise that I’ve had in my life,” Ryan said. “He brought me up with the game. He was always my coach until I went to UCSB. I [went] to his games and [grew] up with his soccer friends and [watched] soccer with him all the time. He took a lot of time out of his day to help me develop as a player, so I owe a lot to him.”</p>\n<p>The next step for Ryan will be receiving an invitation to the MLS combine, where coaches will take a look at the college seniors. To get drafted, participating in this combine is a must.</p>\n<p>“You would hope as the midfielder of the year he can get that invitation,” Vom Steeg said. “I definitely think he can play at the next level. He makes good decisions on the ball and he’s good around the net, so I think Nic can help a team at the next level; but it’s whether somebody can appreciate that, because he’s not a player that will make an incredible move and make people go ‘wow.’ Because of him, though, your team will play better.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 14th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

His first All-Big West honor of his career, Ryan is the third consecutive Gaucho to earn the award.</p>\n<p>Ryan tied for third in both goals and points, tallying eight goals and three assists for 19 points on the year, 12 of which came during Big West play. Ryan also ranked fourth in conference in game-winning goals with four.</p>\n<p>“I was extremely happy that Nic Ryan, a player who hasn’t gotten a whole lot of publicity and not a whole lot of people have talked about him, got Midfielder of the Year,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Freshman midfielder Ema Boateng took the Big West Freshman of the Year award after posting four goals and four assists, becoming the third player in the last four years to win the award for the Gauchos. He also tied for fifth in the Big West in game- winning goals with two.</p>\n<p>“We always knew that Ema was going to win the award,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said. “Usually freshmen don’t step in right away, but he helped us both offensively and defensively.”</p>\n<p>Three Gauchos made the All-Big West First Team: Ryan, Boateng and Baiden. Baiden started 17 of 19 games en route to his first league honor of his career. Playing a defensive mid, Baiden’s contributions may not show up in the box scores, but he was indispensable to UCSB, controlling the midfield, aiding the UCSB defense and allowing other players to push up.</p>\n<p>“I thought [Baiden] was our most consistent player all year,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s the one that makes things go for us, so it’s good that others recognized that he had a good season.”</p>\n<p>In his first year with UCSB, junior defender Daniel Welsh earned All-Big West Second Team honors. He started 17 games and was often responsible for guarding the opponent’s best attacker. With Welsh, the Gauchos tallied an impressive 0.90 goals- against average and five shutouts.</p>\n<p>“It’s exciting he got Second Team,” Baiden said. “I thought we would make First Team, but it’s a new conference for him and he made his mark as a good defender. I see him being the defender of the year next year.”</p>\n<p>Finally, senior midfielder Josue Madueno earned an Honorable Mention pick for the second straight season. Madueno was just one of two players to play in every game this season and stepped up big when UCSB was plagued with injuries.</p>\n<p>“I think Josue deserved a little more,” Vom Steeg said. “He’s a great team guy and he played wherever we needed.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 15, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48930\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48930\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/gauchos-garner-2012-big-west-honors/","id":1618,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1617,1616,1615],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Squeaks Out Home Opening Win","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It was another close game for the UCSB women’s basketball team, but this time, the result was different as the team held on for a 43-41 victory over New Mexico State last night in the Thunderdome.

With the score at 11-9, junior guard Nicole Nesbit converted a three point play and sparked a 13-2 run to give the Gauchos a 24-11 lead. Santa Barbara finished the half up 26-14.</p>\n<p>“They were playing us man [defense],” Mitchell said. “We were going inside out. It’s a lot easier executing on a man defense because you know who you want to get the shot for.” Offensively, Santa Barbara looked solid</p>\n<p>in the first half, outshooting New Mexico State 43.5 to 21.4 percent. Nesbit was especially fiery in the first half, scoring 11 points, a mere three points less than the Aggies had in the half.</p>\n<p>“I felt really good in the first half,” Nesbit said. “My teammates were setting great screens and we were just running our normal offense, so it felt good to knock down some shots.”</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos controlled the first half, the second half told a different story as UCSB was outscored 27-17.</p>\n<p>The Aggies crawled back in the game little by little, going on two small 5-0 and 4-0 runs. Meanwhile, Santa Barbara struggled on the offensive end, shooting just 28.6 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“They went zone,” Mitchell said. “They went to a three-two [zone], high and wide most of the time. We’ll have to work on it.”</p>\n<p>With 1:41 remaining, senior forward Kelsie Rozendaal converted a three-point play, which brought the game to within three at 39-36.</p>\n<p>Then, sophomore guard Danesia Williamson knocked down a three with five seconds left to bring New Mexico State within two for the first time since the 13:23 mark in the first half. With little time remaining, the Aggies fouled Nesbit, who missed the one and one, but came up with a defensive strip as time expired.</p>\n<p>“Missing that last [free throw] … I was very frustrated,” Nesbit said. “I think I [then] took a little bit of a risk [on defense], but I was just worried about getting it back and not giving them a chance to get a shot off.”</p>\n<p>As usual, the defense for the Gauchos caused their opponent problems, holding a team that averaged 78.5 points in its first two games including an exhibition to 41.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara also held New Mexico to just 1-14 from behind the arc, a much different result than last year’s 8-13 display by the Aggies when the two teams faced off. Meanwhile, UCSB shot 5-10 from downtown.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s next game will be next Tuesday in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico against Oregon State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 10 of November 15, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48933\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48933\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-squeaks-home-opening-win/","id":698,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[697,696,695],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB To Play Aggies in Home Opener","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The UCSB women’s basketball team looks for its first win of the season tonight when the team plays in its home opener against New Mexico State.

While the Gauchos outshot the Aggies from the field 50 to 40 percent, New Mexico was on fire from behind the arc, hitting 8-13 threes.</p>\n<p>“Most of the time, their threes came when we went to a three-two matchup zone,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Hopefully, we’re a little more advanced in our half court man and we don’t have to rely on the zone.”</p>\n<p>UCSB should match up well against New Mexico, which plays a four-guard lineup. Not only is UCSB deep in the guard department, but the Gauchos should also see a rare height advantage.</p>\n<p>“On the offensive end, if we ever have a height advantage — because that doesn’t happen very often — we need to take advantage of that when it’s there,” Tilleman said.</p>\n<p>The inside-out game will be crucial for UCSB. Last year, the Gauchos outscored the Aggies 20-10 in paint buckets.</p>\n<p>“We have to find a way to get a post player involved in double-figure scoring,” Mitchell said. “We understand that’ll make Nic and Mel’s lives a bit easier if they can get some open jumpers, but the only way to do that is if we’ve established an inside presence early on in the game.”</p>\n<p>One of those guards UCSB will keep a close eye on is senior Stefanie Gilbreath, a transfer from USC. In the Aggies’ exhibition game, Gilbreath scored 26 points in 23 minutes on 10-14 shooting.</p>\n<p>“[We’ll] change it up on her and give her different bodies,”Mitchell said.“Great players, a lot of times, will find ways to get their points, but you have to be cautious of letting other people get involved and scoring above their averages.”</p>\n<p>In New Mexico’s first game of the season against Loyola Marymount, the Lions shut down Gilbreath, holding her to 12 points on 3-15 shooting, but her teammates picked up the slack. Redshirt senior forward Kelsie Rozendaal tallied 22 points and 11 boards while sophomore guard Danesia Williamson contributed 19 points in the 77-76 victory.</p>\n<p>In the end, the game may come down to tempo. The Aggies want to score, averaging 78.5 points per game. The Gauchos, on the other hand, would like the game to be determined on the defensive end. Known for its tenacious defense, UCSB has only averaged 52 points per game and will try to keep the two teams’ point totals much lower.</p>\n<p>“We play through our defense,” Tilleman said. “We need to get more aggressive; we were disappointed with our defense against UNLV. We need to not see a number or a player or a jersey and just play like we normally do.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">A version of this article appeared on page 9 of November 14th, 2012’s print edition of the Nexus.</span></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48878\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-play-aggies-home-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48878\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-play-aggies-home-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-play-aggies-home-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-play-aggies-home-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-14/ucsb-play-aggies-home-opener/","id":697,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[696,695,694],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops Season Opener in Vegas","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite a career-high 13 points from senior guard Destini Mason, the UCSB women’s basketball team was unable to come away with a win on the road in the team’s season opener, losing 58-52 to UNLV i...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Despite a career-high 13 points from senior guard Destini Mason, the UCSB women’s basketball team was unable to come away with a win on the road in the team’s season opener, losing 58-52 to UNLV in a game that came down to the final minute for the second straight year.</p>\n<p>The loss marks the fourth consecutive year that the Gauchos have lost their season opener.

Sophomore forward Alana Cesarz led the run for the Rebels, scoring six of UNLV’s 13 final points of the half.</p>\n<p>UCSB played catch-up the majority of the second half. However, with 6:40 remaining, Mason converted a crucial layup that not only gave her a new career high, but also gave the Gauchos a 44-42 lead, their first of the second half.</p>\n<p>“On offense, she can attack and create her own shot and create for others,” Mitchell said. “She has that ability to score in double figures every night.”</p>\n<p>The home team quickly responded as senior guard Kelli Thompson drained a three to regain the lead. UCSB junior guard Nicole Nesbit hit an elbow jumper to make the score 46-45 with under five minutes to go, but that would be the last lead the Gauchos would see. UNLV went on an 8-3 run, sparked by Thompson, enough to give the Rebels a small cushion.</p>\n<p>“We had some miscommunication and during the breakdown, [Thompson] was able to get rebound put backs,” Mitchell said. “Our defense has to be better and we know that.”</p>\n<p>Like last year’s game, it came down to the very end. Nesbit came up with a steal at half court and made the open layup with 24 seconds left, bringing the Gauchos within two at 52-54.</p>\n<p>UCSB then had to foul. Thompson made both free throws to expand the lead back to a two possession game. On UCSB’s next possession, junior guard Rmanii Haynes stole the ball from Nesbit and was able to ice the game for UNLV from the line.</p>\n<p>While the Gauchos held Thompson to just five points in the first half, the Rebels’ leader came alive in the second, finishing the game with a double-double with 18 points and 11 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“It was frustrating,” Mitchell said. “We knew the ball was going to go to her and through her.”</p>\n<p>Rebounding, which was a huge focus for UCSB this week, was another issue as the Gauchos were outrebounded 43-33.</p>\n<p>“The first half, we did a decent job,” Mitchell said. “In the second half, when he had breakdowns, we were scrambling and that leads to a lot of mistakes on the block out.

Junior guard Melissa Zornig also tallied nine points and six assists.</p>\n<p>“I saw a lot of positive things [against Vanguard],” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, we held them to 39 points and we had tons of defensive mistakes, but a lot of it was just communication. That’s easy to fix.”</p>\n<p>UCSB outrebounded Vanguard 44-35. Rebounding will be a key statistic today, as UNLV has seven players listed at over 6’0’’.</p>\n<p>“We did a lot of rebounding drills today because we’re not the tallest or most physical team, so we have to pay attention to make sure we’re blocking out every time and limiting their second chance opportunities,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Gauchos are just 9-27 against the Rebels. Last year when these two teams met up, UCSB lost 46-44 on a buzzer beater. While the last second shot stung for the Gauchos, it was rebounding that cost them the game. UNLV outrebounded Santa Barbara by 18 (45-27) and UCSB gave up 19 offensive boards.</p>\n<p>Zornig scored 13 points in last year’s match up while Nesbit tallied 11. UCSB needs repeat performances from its point guards in order to win.</p>\n<p>“We need both of them to score,” Mitchell said. “They’re probably our best three-point shooters, so they have to find a balance, what’s a good shot and when to get people involved and then also continue to look for their own shot.”</p>\n<p>UNLV played its first game of the year Monday in an exhibition versus Dixie State. In the 68-53 victory, the Rebels had three players in double figures. Senior guard Kelli Thompson led the Rebels with 19 points and nine rebounds. Sophomore guard Danielle Miller and sophomore forward Alana Cesarz each added 13 and 11 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>“They have three or four seniors, so they’re probably a lot like us early in the year,” Mitchell said. “You’re trying to find your identity. We always do what we have to do on the defensive end of things. We know we’ll have to stop their transition and limit their second chance points.”</p>\n<p>Staying calm on offense will be a big key for UCSB as well. The Rebels like to pressure the ball and force turnovers. Against Dixie State, UNLV forced 24 total turnovers and tallied 16 steals.</p>\n<p>Against Vanguard, UCSB committed 18 turnovers, a number that may prove too high against an athletic UNLV team.</p>\n<p>“[The key offensively will be] taking care of the ball under pressure,” Aguirre said. “[We have to] be calm because they’re really athletic and they’re going to pressure us.”</p>\n<p>As an athletic team, expect UNLV to push the ball and get out in transition. The Gauchos will need to improve on last game’s transition defense and limit the Rebels’ point total.</p>\n<p>“They’re very athletic,” Mitchell said. “If we can keep them, like we did last year, in the 30s and 40s [and] emphasize our transition defense, we should have a chance to win.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48749\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-09/gauchos-open-201213-season-road-unlv/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48749\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-09/gauchos-open-201213-season-road-unlv/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-09/gauchos-open-201213-season-road-unlv/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-09/gauchos-open-201213-season-road-unlv/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-11-09/gauchos-open-201213-season-road-unlv/","id":726,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[725,724,723],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":9,"highestPage":15,"route":"/authors/71"}},"__N_SSG":true}
