A turnover on the other end led to a trey by senior guard Melissa Zornig and a steal and layup in transition from sophomore guard Jasmine Ware completed an 8-0 run for UCSB.</p>\n<p>The increased defensive intensity started by Mason led to a 17-3 run and the Gauchos eventually took a 34-24 lead into the locker room.</p>\n<p>“I think it was our energy on defense that really helped get our offense going,” Ware said. “I think we started talking because we were a little flat in the beginning.”</p>\n<p>However, UCSB would give up its lead as Hampton used offensive rebounds to spark a 15-4 run and tie the game at 39 all. In just the first five minutes of the second half, the Lady Pirates grabbed eight offensive boards, which led to nine second chance points.</p>\n<p>On the game, Santa Barbara was outrebounded 46-30, giving up 24 offensive rebounds.</p>\n<p>“They are amazing athletes and we knew their second, third and fourth opportunity a lot of times is their best shot,” Mitchell said. “We didn’t do a good job of blocking out. No excuses. We are very lucky to win giving up 24 offensive rebounds.”</p>\n<p>The rest of the half, the two teams traded baskets and for the fourth time this year, the Gauchos played in a game went down to the wire.</p>\n<p>Down two with just over a minute remaining, freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe poked the ball from one of Hampton’s leaders, senior guard Nicole Hamilton, and fed Mason on the fast break, who not only converted the layup, but earned the foul. With the made free throw, Mason gave UCSB a 61-60 lead.</p>\n<p>“It was a really hard foul. I was a little hurt, but my teammates were like, ‘it doesn’t really matter. You’re going to have to knock down this free throw,’” Mason said. “I just had to get up and focus on the free throw.”</p>\n<p>Solid defense from the Gauchos on the next possession forced an air ball from Hamilton and the Gauchos were able to finish the Lady Pirates off from the line, going 5-6 down the stretch from the charity stripe.</p>\n<p>UCSB improves to 3-2 on the year while Hampton falls to an identical 3-2 mark.</p>\n<p>Anchoring the team offensively for the Lady Pirates was Bennett, who finished the night with 23 points, 21 coming in the second half, and 16 rebounds. She was one of three players in double-figures for Hampton.</p>\n<p>“It was a really nice win,” Mitchell said. “They’re a very talented team. They probably have a pro player in Alyssa Bennett and even though she ended up with 23 points, we made her work extremely hard for those 23 points, so it’s a great win.”</p>\n<p>UCSB returns to play this Saturday at home against San Diego State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53340\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53340\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-27/gauchos-grind-out-win-against-hampton/","id":586,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[585,584,583],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Tries for Two in a Row at Home","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.4.2013_UCSB_Womens_Basketball_vs_Peter_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11.4.2013_UCSB_Womens_Basketball_vs_Peter_Vandenbelt.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos take on Hampton at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Many students are heading home for Thanksgiving right now, but for the UCSB women’s basketball team, there is business to be taken care of over the holiday break.</p>\n<p>After spending last weekend on the road, the Gauchos return home for a two-game home stand, taking on Hampton tonight.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara is currently 2-2 on the year.

With a final score of 67-62, the Gauchos found a way to come from behind after trailing the entire first half.</p>\n<p>“From this game, we learned we need to bring energy from the start,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “I feel that game wouldn’t have been close if we’d started the game with a lot of energy.”</p>\n<p>As a shorter team, one highlight was the team’s ability to contain the Broncos’ pair of 6’4’’ centers.</p>\n<p>“It’s good to know that Santa Clara had two 6’4’’ players on the floor most of the night and I think we were only outrebounded by one,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Our post defense was much better. We’re finding different ways to win and all our players are contributing.”</p>\n<p>To secure the victory, the trio of Gaucho seniors put the team on their backs, combining for 50 of 67 points. This season, senior guards Nicole Nesbit, Destini Mason and Zornig have combined for 65.3 percent of the team’s scoring.</p>\n<p>Zornig especially found her stride over the weekend, posting 19 points and a career-high nine assists against St. Mary’s, and then scoring 18 against Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig is] finding different ways to score,” Mitchell said. “I think early in the year, she was taking a lot of threes and at times they weren’t falling. Now, she has that attack mentality of, ‘Hey, if my three’s not falling, I own the midrange jumper,’ and then also being able to get into the lane and being able to draw fouls.”</p>\n<p>As UCSB settles into the season, one note of improvement the Gauchos will be looking for this week is consistency, as the team has, on multiple occasions this year, started out slow and had to come from behind.</p>\n<p>“We need to understand that we have the ability to close out games and put two halves together and sustain that energy,” Nesbit said. “We need to play as a team because it’s going to take all of us.”</p>\n<p>Similar to UCSB, Hampton will rely on its defense, averaging 66 points per game while holding teams to 57.8 points per game. This season, Santa Barbara has averaged 67.8 points per game while giving up 64 points per contest.</p>\n<p>Hampton also has an impressive trio of scorers. Freshman guard Malia Tate-DeFreitas averages 18 points per game, leading the Lady Pirates. Senior forward Alyssa Bennett ranks second on the team in scoring with 16.8 points per game and senior guard Nicole Hamilton averages 14.3 points and 3.5 assists per game.</p>\n<p>Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 26th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53300\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53300\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-26/ucsb-tries-for-two-in-a-row-at-home/","id":619,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[618,617,616],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Defeats Santa Clara on the Road","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-basketball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i2.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-basketball.jpg?resize=854%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB snapped a two-game skid on Saturday.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>What a 67-62 final score says is that the UCSB women’s basketball team beat Santa Clara Saturday night, earning its first road victory of the year.

Nevertheless, she missed both free throws, opening the door for the Broncos.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>However, Santa Clara couldn’t take advantage, turning the ball over on a three second violation. With 17.3 seconds remaining on the clock, the Broncos almost came up with the steal, tipping the ball out of bounds. On the second chance, UCSB was forced to call a timeout, unable to inbound the ball.</p>\n<p>“We had a press set that should’ve given us three options, but they did a good job of denying Nic,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “Then, we went to trying to have Destini get open as well, but they had a lot of pressure on the ball. They had 6’4’’ on the ball, so it had to be a bounce pass to get the ball inbounds.”</p>\n<p>On the third shot, the Gauchos successfully inbounded to Nesbit, the team’s top free throw shooter, who went 4-4 from the free throw line down the stretch to ice the game.</p>\n<p>“We’ve done this hundreds and hundreds of times, probably thousands,” Nesbit said. “You can’t worry about the atmosphere; nothing’s different about it.”</p>\n<p>The win snaps a two-game losing streak for the Gauchos as they improve to 2-2. With the loss, Santa Clara falls to 0-4.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely exciting to get that first road win,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We came in there upset from the last game (against St. Mary’s) and we went in there to fight tonight. We really wanted to win the game, so we went out with a lot of energy.”</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara’s seniors took the reins in earning their team its first road victory, combining for 50 of the Gauchos’ 67 points. Nesbit, Zornig and Mason finished with 19, 18 and 13 points, respectively. Mason also tallied 10 rebounds for her first double-double of the season.</p>\n<p>“Our seniors stepped up and made critical plays,” Mitchell said. “They didn’t shoot it the best, but Mel found ways to get to the free throw line, Destini got crucial second-chance opportunities late in the game and Nic was able to keep the ball and knock down big free throws late.”</p>\n<p>The biggest difference for the Gauchos was in the turnover category. UCSB turned the ball over just nine times, compared to Santa Clara’s 21 giveaways, leading to 26-6 advantage in points off turnovers. UCSB was also able to contain Santa Clara’s height inside, limiting their two 6’4’’ players to 14 combined points.</p>\n<p>“We stress our defense,” Nesbit said. “We knew going into this game they had a couple legit 6’4’’ players, so we knew we were going to have to full front. You can’t play behind them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB next hosts Hampton tomorrow.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 25, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53249\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53249\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-25/ucsb-defeats-santa-clara-on-the-road/","id":617,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[616,615,614],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Drops First Road Game of the Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W_Basketball_N16_Margarita.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/W_Basketball_N16_Margarita.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"Gauchos fall 89-79 to the Gaels","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team has proved itself an offensive force this year, but the Gauchos still couldn’t keep up with the potent offense of St. Mary’s as they fell 89-79 yesterday in their first road game of the season.</p>\n<p>Although Santa Barbara scored the second most points during the Carlene Mitchell era with 79, the 89 points the Gauchos gave up was the most since Mitchell’s arrival to UCSB.

The Gaels were 6-8 from behind the arc and 21-28 from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen a team shoot 63 percent from the field, so that was rough,” senior guard Destini Mason said. “I don’t think we were as sharp as we couldn’t been defensively.”</p>\n<p>The options were plentiful for St. Mary’s on the offensive end as the team ended the night with four players in double figures. Leading the offense were senior guard Kate Gaze and sophomore guard Lauren Nicholson, who on the season only average 11.7 and 10.7 points per game, respectively. However, with Nared on the bench, the guards stepped up, tallying 26 points apiece. Danielle Mauldin also added a double-double with 18 points and 14 rebounds.</p>\n<p>“They have balanced scoring, so there’s not just one player that can get it done,” Mitchell said. “You have to give them credit for finding the mismatches and taking advantage of it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos drop to 1-2 overall while the Gaels stay perfect on the year, improving to 4-0.</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s powerful offense was evident straight from the tip. Nicolson knocked down consecutive threes and St. Mary’s jumped out to a quick eight point, which was kept rest of half.</p>\n<p>“It was a frustrating game,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We let them get the shots they wanted and they knocked a lot of shots down. We just didn’t get it done defensively.”</p>\n<p>To start the final period, Santa Barbara’s seniors put the team on their backs, scoring UCSB’s first 11 first points of the half to cut St. Mary’s lead to just one point.</p>\n<p>All three seniors for the Gauchos finished in double-figures. Zornig scored 19 points, four steals and a career-high nine assists while Mason also had a career-high setting night. She finished with a personal best 18 points and seven rebounds, breaking the career-high she already broke earlier this season when she scored 16 against Occidental. Finally, consistent as always, senior guard Nicole Nesbit tallied 17 points.</p>\n<p>“We know the dynamic of the team and we know we have to step it up to another level,” Mason said. “I’m glad Mel got in her rhythm and started knocking down some stuff. We know we have to be on our game because everyone’s following our lead.”</p>\n<p>But St. Mary’s offense was relentless. An 8-0 run a little over halfway through the half gave the Gaels an 11 point cushion, which would be enough to keep the Gauchos at bay the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will continue its road trip Saturday at Santa Clara.

We know we’re at and that we can hang with the Pac-12. It’s just a conference.”</p>\n<p>The most critical error for UCSB was in the rebounding column. The Wildcats outrebounded the Gauchos 40-32, including 24-14 in the second half, grabbing critical offensive rebounds that gave Arizona extra opportunities.</p>\n<p>“It was different players at different phases of the game and two or three of them were at the free throw line,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “That’s a lack of focus and a lack of discipline. I think our kids will write it across their chests to not let those same mistakes happen.”</p>\n<p>Against top competition, UCSB continued to see consistent production from its three seniors. On the season, Nesbit leads the team, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 assists and 1.5 steals per game. Mason has tallied 13 points and 5.0 rebounds per game and senior guard Melissa Zornig has added 5.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists per contest.</p>\n<p>“[The seniors are] above and beyond expectations,” Mitchell said. “In year number three, I can communicate with them on a different level. With Nic, Mel and Destini, they’ve been ultimate leaders and a pleasure.”</p>\n<p>For the first time this season, the Gauchos will have to deal with a very tall team. While the average height for Santa Barbara is 5’9’’, the Gaels measure in at an average height of 5’11’’. The defense will especially be tested as starting center senior Carli Rosenthal is 6’3’’.</p>\n<p>St. Mary’s also features taller guards, headlined by senior guard Jackie Nared. At 6’1’’, Nared is averaging an incredible 23.7 points, 7.7 rebounds and 4.3 assists, shooting 53.2 percent from the field, including 46.7 percent from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“The taller guards have been a thorn in our back,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully, we can keep [Nared] out of rhythm and we’ve been doing a better job of pressing this year, so hopefully we can make them speed it up more than their used to and then we don’t have to guard them in the half court.”</p>\n<p>As an offensively minded team, the Gaels have four players averaging double-figures and have tallied 84.3 points in their first three games.</p>\n<p>“They’re tough. They put up 90 [points] just about every night and probably the one stat to me that I don’t know if I’ve ever seen in my 20 years of coaching is 50 free throw attempts against Butler on the road,” Mitchell said. “That just tells me they have an attack mentality. It’s not going to be a finesse game. It’s going to be attack the paint and attack the boards. We’ll definitely have our hands full.”</p>\n<p>Even as a team that likes to push the ball, UCSB has averaged 63.5 points per game. In the season opener, Santa Barbara put 76 points on the scoreboard, tying the second most in the Carlene Mitchell era.</p>\n<p>“We know what we’re capable of on the defensive end. Defense is going to be the main game plan,” Nesbit said. “I think for us, we’ve been scoring more than the past couple seasons, so we know we’re going to get them to play our game and speed it up and see if they can hang with us.”</p>\n<p>Tip off tonight is set for 6 p.m. at McKeon Pavilion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 21st’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Margarita Baliyan of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53145\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53145\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-21/gauchos-travel-north-for-first-road-trip-of-the-season-see-tough-competition-tonight-vs-st-marys/","id":615,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[614,613,612],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall Short of Upsetting Arizona","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-bball.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/womens-bball.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB falls to Arizona 51-49 at the Thunderdome.","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>Pac-12 schools have earned impressive reputations in the sports world.

The basket increased Nesbit’s point total to 18, which led all Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“We knew that we had an advantage getting to the rim,” Nesbit said. “I saw a lane and I took it.”</p>\n<p>Down on the other end, freshman forward LaBrittney Jones received the basketball on the right block. As she went up for the shot, she earned the foul call and hit both free throws to give the Wildcats a two-point advantage.</p>\n<p>Arizona ran the clock down to 6.8 seconds by fouling the Gauchos with remaining fouls to give. On the inbounds, senior guard Melissa Zornig got into the lane, but was quickly trapped. She was able to get a shot off, but the highly-contested shot wouldn’t fall, leading to Santa Barbara’s first loss of the season.</p>\n<p>“I am a competitor and a sore loser, but as a head coach I am extremely proud of the effort,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “The effort was there. There was no doubt about it.”</p>\n<p>While the contest went down to the final buzzer, the game was not ultimately decided in the final minutes, but rather earlier in the second half.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos put the Wildcats in the penalty with 8:15 remaining, leading to 15 free throw attempts down the stretch. On the game, Arizona shot 19 free throws compared to just six for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“We know the new rule change and we have to make the adjustment. The players have to understand that [the refs] are going to call the hand checks,” Mitchell said. “Arizona was more aggressive attacking the paint. I think at times, we settled for too many jumpers. In our first two games, I think we shot 19 and 21 free throws, so that’s definitely the difference in the game.”</p>\n<p>Also critical in the loss was the rebounding margin. Santa Barbara was outrebounded 40-32, including 24-14 in the second half. Twice when the Wildcats headed to the charity stripe, the Gauchos didn’t box out, giving Arizona extra scoring opportunities and erasing the seven point lead UCSB had earned to begin the second half.</p>\n<p>“We probably went a little smaller in the second half. When that happens, we should know we can’t out jump them,” Mitchell said. “You have to make an effort to block out. I think we started trying to tip the ball to ourselves. You can’t do that against stronger athletes.”</p>\n<p>The loss drops Santa Barbara to 1-1 on the season while Arizona earned its first win of the season, improving to 1-2.</p>\n<p>“There are so many things that we could control that would have led to a different outcome,” Mitchell said. “We have to hold ourselves accountable. Give Arizona all the credit in the world. They found a way to win on our court after two overtime losses, but if we could go back and exchange about three or four possessions, that final score would’ve been a little different.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Wildcats on the offensive end was redshirt junior guard Candice Warthen, who totaled 18 points and three assists on the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, UCSB held Warthen below her season average of 21.5 points and 6.5 assists. Taking the defensive assignment on Warthen was freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe, who, in her first start as a Gaucho, totaled seven points, three assists and two steals.</p>\n<p>“[Jemerigbe] brings so much,” Nesbit said. “Her defensive intensity when she comes in, we seem to step it up to another level. We get excited because she’s picking people up 94 feet [from the basket] and she’s pressuring and you can tell their offensive players do not like it.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos continued to receive consistent production from their seniors. Along with Nesbit, Zornig tallied eight points, six rebounds and a team-high five assists. Senior guard Destini Mason also added 10 points.</p>\n<p>Next week, UCSB will take its first road trip of the season, traveling north to play St. Mary’s on Thursday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 18, 2013’s print edition of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of </em>The Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-53063\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-53063\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-18/gauchos-fall-short-of-upsetting-arizona/","id":612,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[611,610,609],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Welcomes Pac-12 Foe Arizona to the Thunderdome","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Girls-Basketball-11.4-Shaminder-Dhindsa-069.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Girls-Basketball-11.4-Shaminder-Dhindsa-069.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"The Gauchos play their second game of the year against tough competition.

Arizona on the other hand, is still looking for its first victory of the year at 0-2.</p>\n<p>“They’ve lost their first two games in overtime, so they’re right there,” Mitchell said. “They’re extremely athletic. They’ll be bigger, stronger, quicker, but hopefully we continue to improve and do what we do well.”</p>\n<p>UCSB enters Saturday’s match-up with momentum after a 76-54 blowout over Occidental in the season opener. With 76 points, the team scored the second-most in the Carlene Mitchell era. Utilizing a fast-paced transition offense which led to 50.8 percent shooting from the field, UCSB went on a 39-10 run to end the first half and begin the second half, taking a 28 point lead that would be too large for Occidental to overcome.</p>\n<p>“We know as a team that we can score and that we’re good in transition,” senior guard Melissa Zornig said. “We’re small this year, so we have to push the ball and get points off of transition.”</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Arizona started its season with two close overtime losses to Iona and Michigan. In those two games, the Wildcats were outrebounded by an average of 10 boards, something UCSB would like to take advantage of to jump start its offense.</p>\n<p>“If we outrebound them and limit turnovers, we’ll be good,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware said. “If we get rebounds, we can push the ball and our best offense is when we push the ball.”</p>\n<p>Although Arizona returns four starters from last year’s squad, the team is extremely young with seven of the 12 members listed as underclassmen. Also as a team that isn’t extremely tall, it should be a good match-up for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“They like to push it and everything’s going to and through their guards, so they’re very similar to us,” Mitchell said. “We’ll look to take a lot of switches because their tallest player that’s gotten any minutes is 6’1’’.”</p>\n<p>Leading the Wildcats offensively is redshirt junior guard Candice Warthen, who missed last season with a knee injury. At just 5’5’’, Warthen is averaging 21.5 points, 6.5 assists and three steals per game.</p>\n<p>Other offensive threats include senior guard Kama Griffitts , who as a taller guard averages 15.0 points per game, and freshman forward Dejza James. In her first two games, James scored 11.5 points and five rebounds on 10-15 shooting.</p>\n<p>“The biggest key for us will be defense, like every game,” Zornig said. “Just because it’s Arizona, we’re not looking at them any different than Occidental. We don’t look at the name on the jersey. We just want to go out there and play.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. Saturday at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

When we can score and shut people down on the defensive end of things, we’ll be a pretty good team.”</p>\n<p>The team that ranked last in the Big West last year in points per game, at 51.3, used a high-pace offense and the fast break to tie the second-highest point total during the Carlene Mitchell era, scoring 76 points. The new run-and-gun style led to easy buckets as Santa Barbara shot an incredible 50.8 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“We want to push the ball more because we feel like we’re conditioned,” sophomore forward Kendra Morrison said. “Our guards are stealing the ball higher up on the court, so it’s easier to get transition layups.”</p>\n<p>Ironically, in UCSB’s first home game of the year, the Gauchos got off to an extremely slow start offensively, scoring just nine points in the first nine minutes of the game. However, once Santa Barbara caught fire, there was no looking back.</p>\n<p>In typical Gaucho fashion, UCSB used its defense to fuel its offense. With just under eight minutes remaining, Santa Barbara’s full-court press resulted in a 10-second backcourt violation by Occidental. A minute later, a steal by freshman guard Onome Jemerigbe led to two free throws, sparking a 14-0 spurt by the Gauchos.</p>\n<p>“Our defense got us pumped up,” sophomore guard Jasmine Ware, who tallied four steals, said. “There was a lot of intensity when we were pressing. It just really got us going and helped the flow of the offense as well.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos ended the half on a 22-8 run to take a comfortable 39-26 lead into halftime.</p>\n<p>Despite having only nine players on the roster, UCSB showed no signs of tiring entering the second half as it continued to get out on the break and beat its opponent down the court. The Gauchos started the second half on a 17-2 run, led by senior guard Destini Mason, who scored eight of her career-high 16 points during the run.</p>\n<p>With 11:31 to go, Santa Barbara held a 26-point lead, its largest of the game, scoring 55 points in the previous 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>“Overall, I was extremely proud of the effort,” Mitchell said. “There were three- and four-minute spurts where we were really good.”</p>\n<p>Three players finished in double-figures for UCSB. Along with Mason’s 16 points, Ware tallied a career-high 12 points. Leading the way offensively was senior guard Nicole Nesbit, who played a complete game with 17 points, six assists, six rebounds and three steals.</p>\n<p>“Nic’s growth has just been tremendous, from her sophomore year when she came off the bench, to last year leading the team from the point and in the scoring position,” Mitchell said. “Now, [she’s] being asked to score, lead, sometimes run the point, sometimes move to the two spot, and I think she’s also taken into heart to be a great defender.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos also won the assist category at 17-8 and out-rebounded the Tigers 43-26, a crucial element for an undersized Santa Barbara squad that wants to run.</p>\n<p>UCSB will be back in action next Saturday when it completes a three-game home stand against Pac-12 opponent University of Arizona.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Peter Vandenbelt of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52899\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-take-easy-win-in-season-opener/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52899\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-take-easy-win-in-season-opener/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-take-easy-win-in-season-opener/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-take-easy-win-in-season-opener/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-12/gauchos-take-easy-win-in-season-opener/","id":607,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[606,605,604],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Open 2013-14 Season","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Girls-Basketball-11.4-Shaminder-Dhindsa-067.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Girls-Basketball-11.4-Shaminder-Dhindsa-067.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB takes on Occidental at home","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The UCSB women’s basketball team officially begins its 2013-14 season Sunday with its home opener against Occidental.</p>\n<p>Playing with just five returners from last year’s squad, the Gauchos will look to take advantage of playing in the Thunderdome as Santa Barbara’s first two games of the year will be at home.</p>\n<p>“I always have a great time playing at home,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “I know we struggled a bit last year, but that year’s over.

After going down by 16 in the second half, UCSB finally found its stride and was able to tie the game with less than two minutes to go. However, the comeback effort wasn’t enough.</p>\n<p>“Overall I felt pretty good about [the game]” Nesbit said. “I think we did some good things. Unfortunately, and this is something we struggled with last year, we couldn’t put two halves together. We were two completely different teams in the first half and second half and once we learn how to put those halves together we’re going to be pretty good.”</p>\n<p>One of those positive elements was the Gauchos’ offense as they did receive offensive contributions from everyone on the roster, with Nesbit leading the way with 15 points, seven rebounds and six assists.</p>\n<p>“At first it was like ‘oh my god we just lost,’” senior guard Destini Mason said. “But after really thinking about it and seeing how young we are, I started to see more positive things. I think we’re a better offensive team than we were last year.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit is one of three seniors this season that highlight the Gaucho squad. Senior guard Melissa Zornig, who was also in double-figures Monday with 13 points, led the team last year in three point percentage at 32.5 percent. And Mason serves as the versatile defensive stopper for UCSB.</p>\n<p>“With me, Mel and Dest, we all lead, but we lead in different ways,” Nesbit said. “We all have very different personalities so us coming together and understanding what we want out of ourselves as well as out of our team, it’s going to be really good because there are different dynamics.”</p>\n<p>The focus for Santa Barbara this weekend will be defense after allowing Vanguard to shoot 49.0 percent from the field. A team typically known for their tenacious defense, last season the Gauchos held their opponents to just 52.4 points per game, the best in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“It comes down to defense,” Nesbit said. “With Vanguard, we were bad one on one. That’s something we’ve worked on this week in practice and it’s going to be key throughout the year because we’re fast and we need to use that to our advantage. We need to be disciplined on that end of the floor.”</p>\n<p>As for the opponent, this will be Occidental’s first game of the year. The Tigers lost their star to graduation last season in forward Makenzie Brandon, who averaged 21.7 points per game.</p>\n<p>Of the returners, the leading scorer from last year is senior forward Elizabeth Messick . Messick averaged 10.5 points and 10.6 rebounds per game last season and at 6’3’’ could be a problem against a shorter UCSB squad.</p>\n<p>“We don’t see an opponent’s jersey,” Nesbit said. “It’s always about being the best player you can be and the best team we can be. Once you get that in your mind, no one is going to be able to stop you.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>This article is an online exclusive and did not appear in the print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52876\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52876\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-11-08/gauchos-open-2013-14-season/","id":608,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[607,606,605],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Fall to Lions in Exhibition Game","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Girls-Basketball-11.4-Shaminder-Dhindsa-064.jpg?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Girls-Basketball-11.4-Shaminder-Dhindsa-064.jpg?resize=980%2C647&ssl=1","description":"UCSB loses 69-66 to Vanguard in an exhibition game","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>There was good news and there was bad news for the UCSB women’s basketball team against Vanguard last night.</p>\n<p>The bad news is the Gauchos lost 69-66 to the Lions, despite an incredible second-half comeback.

Overall, the Gauchos allowed Vanguard to shoot 49.0 percent from the field, including 41.2 percent from three point range, numbers very uncharacteristic for a UCSB squad that has led the Big West in scoring defense the last two seasons.</p>\n<p>Leading the Lions offensively were Ballestero and sophomore forward Samantha Doucette, who moved through UCSB’s defense with ease, scoring 24 and 16 points respectively.</p>\n<p>Entering the second half with a 33-27 lead, the Lions began the second half the same way they started the game, making a quick push to put Santa Barbara in a hole. Jumping out to a 14-4 lead, Vanguard earned its largest lead of the game at 47-31 with just less than 15 minutes to go.</p>\n<p>Taking 35 minutes to shake the rust, UCSB finally came alive. Staying true to what has won them ball games in the past, they picked up their defensive intensity which also fueled the team’s offense.</p>\n<p>“We started to pick up our defense more in the second half, and I think that led to more transition,” senior guard Nicole Nesbit said. “We were able to get out and run and not have to play in the half court and run set offenses.”</p>\n<p>Despite the loss, the Gauchos did see offensive contributions from everyone on the roster. With a constantly rotating lineup, all nine players tallied at least two points for Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>“We had great minutes from Christine Brance and Onome was wonderful,” Mitchell said. “She allows [Nesbit] to settle into that two spot and be free to shoot the basketball.”</p>\n<p>Nesbit led the way with 15 points for the Gauchos, one of three players in double-figures. She also tallied seven rebounds and six assists, both team-highs for UCSB.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara will play its first official game of the season Sunday at home against Occidental.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of November 5th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</p>\n<p>Photo by Shaminder Dhindsa of the Daily Nexus.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

\r\n</script> \n<p>In addition, after losing its entire starting frontline to graduation, Santa Barbara will feature a much smaller lineup this year, with only two forwards and one center on the roster.</p>\n<p>If any players will look familiar, it will be the guards as UCSB’s trio of seniors will be the leaders of this year’s team.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be obvious with anyone we play we’re going to be undersized,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “But we have an experienced group of guards and they’ve worked extremely hard and it’s their third year in our system.”</p>\n<p>With a new team comes a new style of play, especially on the offensive end. While the Gauchos finished last in the Big West in scoring offense last season at 51.3 points per game, a fast-paced, run-and-gun offense will complement the smaller lineup and the Gauchos will try to spread the floor with guards that can score in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>“I’ll make the adjustment that we’ll have to get up and down,” Mitchell said. “I think in the past, it was in our benefit to find ways to grind it out, but with this team we’re going to have to keep it pretty simple and spread people out because we have to take advantage of our strengths, which is quickness.”</p>\n<p>However, one thing that won’t change under Mitchell’s control is the focus on defense. The coach that has led Santa Barbara to the postseason in her first two years at UCSB will look to up the defensive intensity, implementing a high-pressure press.</p>\n<p>Last season, the Gauchos topped the conference and ranked 20th in the nation in points allowed per game at 52.9 and opponent field goal percentage at 36.2 percent.</p>\n<p>“We know we have to press a lot more,” Mitchell said. “I think it’ll be to our benefit to speed people up and get easy baskets. Hopefully, we’ll get teams into some shot clock issues with our [press]. Now, we can get more aggressive on the ball and in the passing lanes.”</p>\n<p>UCSB was picked to finish fifth in the Big West Preseason Poll behind Cal Poly, Hawaii, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State.</p>\n<p>“I think we have the chance to be a very good team and hopefully that will be sooner rather than later,” Mitchell said. “Northridge tended to play that same style: quick, small and athletic. That’s probably going to be more of our personality this year.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Guards</p>\n<p>#1 Kristine Brance (junior)</p>\n<p>Brance may be new to UCSB, but she’s not lacking any experience. The Latvia native transfers to Santa Barbara after playing two years at the nationally ranked Chipola College in Florida, where she led her team in scoring, averaging 14.2 points per game. She shot 39 percent from the field and an incredible 36 percent from three point range. Bringing toughness from her experience, knowledge of how to win, as well as the European style to UCSB, Brance will be critical in providing an offensive spark, especially from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>#2 Jasmine Ware (sophomore)</p>\n<p>In her first season at UCSB, Ware showed her potential to fit into Mitchell’s system, proving to be an effective defensive stopper. In her 11.4 minutes per game last year, she averaged 0.5 steals per contest. This year, as a taller guard at 5’10’’, Ware could help the Gauchos offensively too, as she has a smooth shot from 15 to 17 feet. Mitchell even described her midrange game as “second to none on this team.” Plus, needing to play small and push the ball should play right into Ware’s strengths.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#3 Nicole Nesbit (senior)</p>\n<p>One of the three key seniors this season, Nesbit is a two-time All-Big West honorable mention selection. As the floor general last season, she ranked third in minutes at 29.5 per game, second in points per game at 10.5, second in steals per game at 0.8 and led the team in assists per game at 2.8. This season, Nesbit will move over to the shooting guard where she can use her scoring instinct and speed to either get to the basket or rise up for the jumper off the dribble. And the more she can get to the rim, the better because last season she led the team in free throw percentage at an impressive 87.5 percent. According to Mitchell, “we haven’t seen Nic’s best game yet.” She is certainly capable of averaging double digits every night.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#10 Onome Jemerigbe (freshman)</p>\n<p>The player allowing Nesbit to slide over to the shooting guard is Jemerigbe. Coming from a great high school team in St. Mary’s High, Mitchell compared her young point guard to Shannon Bobbitt from Tennessee. Giving the Gauchos a different type of point guard, Jemerigbe has a pass first mentality. Lightning quick, she has the lateral foot speed that UCSB has lacked the last few years, which will allow Santa Barbara to hound the opponent’s ball handler and help in transition defense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#22 Melissa Zornig (senior)</p>\n<p>The second of the trio of seniors, Zornig is another offensive threat for UCSB. She has the ability to score in a variety of ways, averaging 8.0 points per game and 81 percent shooting from the charity stripe last season. However, Zornig can certainly average double-figures this year, as shown by her career-high 24 points against UC Davis last season. Next to Brance, Zornig will form a duo of three-point threats as she led the team in three-point percentage last year at 32.5 percent. She also averaged 2.2 assists last year and led the team in assist to turnover ratio, exemplifying her high basketball I.Q. As the “most consistent player right now” according to Mitchell, Zornig will be a big part of the team and a leader for Santa Barbara this upcoming season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#33 Destini Mason (senior)</p>\n<p>Rounding out the trio of seniors is Mason, who is known as the athletic defensive stopper for the Gauchos. Described by Mitchell as even “light-years better than last year,” Mason has stepped up as the vocal leader for UCSB. Ranking second on the team in three-point percentage last year at 28.0 percent and third on the team in rebounding, but the top rebounding guard, at 3.8 per game, Mason is an exceptionally versatile player. Like Angelei Aguirre from last season, Mason will be asked to play a lot of minutes in lots of positions, anywhere from one through four.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Forwards</p>\n<p>#13 Kendra Morrison (sophomore)</p>\n<p>Morrison only played 5.8 minutes per game last year, but when she did find time on the court, she took advantage, shooting 43.8 percent from the field. Showing what she could do last year against USC where she totaled 11 points on 5-5 shooting, Morrison should expect more minutes this season with the lack of depth at the forward position. With a high basketball I.Q. and the ability to open up the offense because she is a stronger body who can also knock down the three, it could be a breakout season for Morrison.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>#34 Mi’Chael Wright (freshman)</p>\n<p>In high school, Wright averaged 12.7 points and 9.4 rebounds. Now here at UCSB, Wright is a blue-collar player with a knack for rebounding, which will be critical for the Gauchos because if they’re going to play a faster style, they have to be able to rebound. Described by Mitchell to be like Charles Barkley or a more offensively- minded Aguirre from last season, Wright has the ability to put up 10-12 points a night simply on hustle and her notable basketball I.Q.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Center</p>\n<p>#12 Melissa Maragnes (freshman)</p>\n<p>At 6’2’’, Maragnes will be the tallest player on the UCSB roster this season and be responsible for guarding the opponent’s center. At St. Monica High School, she averaged 9.9 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game, setting the school’s block record at 60. As an amazing athlete who Mitchell says plays “almost above the rim,” Maragnes has the potential of becoming a big-time player for Santa Barbara in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 14 of October 30th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Ramon Rovirosa</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

But can they do it again? If they could, they would cement themselves as one of the dynasties in NBA history, as only the Lakers, Celtics and Bulls have ever won three straight titles.</p>\n<p>However, before Miami can think about the legacy they could create, they have to endure 82 games and get to the NBA finals for the fourth straight year, which will be tougher than ever with an incredibly competitive Eastern Conference.</p>\n<p>Luckily for the Heat, they happen to have the two-time reigning MVP in LeBron James, who has gotten better every year. The key for Miami this year will be staying healthy. Its players have logged a lot of minutes in the last three years with three finals trips. If they lose key pieces to injury, the three-peat will be a no-go. But with last year’s roster basically intact, if they can stay healthy, you never know. We may be watching history in the making.</p>\n<p>The Hype in Brooklyn</p>\n<p>On paper, Brooklyn has to have one of the best teams in the league, and possibly the best team in the Nets’ history.</p>\n<p>That roster begins with point guard Deron Williams, one of the best in the league. He’ll have a stacked roster to work with options such as Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Brook Lopez. They also brought in defensive stopper Andrei Kirilenko and shooter Jason Terry. Basically, Brooklyn looks set in every position, but what’s unknown is whether they can come together as a team.</p>\n<p>Several of these players are reaching the end of their careers, so the challenge for freshly retired and new Head Coach Jason Kidd will not only be to make this team mesh, but to find chemistry in a hurry.</p>\n<p>The Lakers’ Injury Status</p>\n<p>Despite the star power in L.A. last season, the Lakers never came together, particularly because of injuries. This season, there is one injury in particular that will matter most: Kobe Bryant’s.</p>\n<p>This team lives and dies right now on the play of Bryant. Nevertheless, this hard-working, determined superstar needs to be careful not to come back too soon. He’s no longer 25 and is showing signs of slowing down. As badly as he wants to be on the court, he needs to stay healthy if the Lakers want a shot at making the playoffs, because without him, they won’t.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with Bryant, the Lakers will always be dangerous. His scoring ability can bring in a win any night of the week.</p>\n<p>A New Era in Sacramento</p>\n<p>The Sacramento Kings have finally finalized where they’ll be playing for a long time: Sacramento. Now that they can actually focus on basketball, it’ll be about rebuilding in the Capital City.</p>\n<p>The Kings just announced the contract extension of DeMarcus Cousins and have decent depth at the point guard spot between Isaiah Thomas and Greivis Vasquez.</p>\n<p>With new ownership working on a new arena and increasing ticket sales and sponsorship, Sacramento is moving in the right direction. They’re certainly not championship material yet, and may not even be playoff contenders, but the improvement by the Kings should be tangible.</p>\n<p>Howard in Houston</p>\n<p>The question right now with Dwight Howard is whether he can find a team he can be happy with. With Orlando, he wasn’t winning, but he was the star. With L.A., he wasn’t the focus and that was a problem. Nothing’s been right so far. So, Howard is once again starting over, this time in Houston.</p>\n<p>Howard brings a much-needed inside presence, as well as a defensive edge, to a Rockets team that has one great scorer in James Harden and a great distributor in Jeremy Lin.</p>\n<p>With his height, wingspan and athletic ability, Howard should be a premier center this year and should turn the Rockets into a playoff contender. But with Howard’s track record, that is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page 6 of October 22nd’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer;

Nevertheless, Saturday’s matchup against Pepperdine will be the first game between the two teams this season.</p>\n<p>Although standing at 7-6, the Waves head into the game with momentum, having won four of their last five games.</p>\n<p>The factor that may most impact the result of Saturday’s game is the play of Pepperdine’s leading scorer and redshirt sophomore utility Luke Hewko. Hewko ranks first on the team in goals scored with 43 on the year, including 19 this past weekend at the SoCal Tournament. In the Waves’ final game of the tourney, Hewko dominated, tallying a season-high seven goals.</p>\n<p>Then on Sunday, Santa Barbara will look for revenge against Cal after a tough 11-3 loss last weekend.</p>\n<p>In that game, the Gauchos struggled offensively, earning one goal only in each of first three quarters and none in fourth. The Golden Bears, on the other hand, went on a 5-1 run to start the game and never looked back, improving to 11-4 on the year.</p>\n<p>Eight players scored a goal for Cal, with junior attacker Aleksa Saponjic (an Olympian for Serbia) leading the way with three goals. Saponjic, who played at the 2012 Olympics for Serbia, currently has 24 goals on the season and makes up one piece of the Golden Bears’ balanced attack.</p>\n<p>To be victorious, UCSB will need to improve its offense. To do so, the Gauchos will rely on senior attacker Matt Gronow, who anchors Santa Barbara’s attack with a team-high 38 goals on the season.

After uncertainty as to the Kings’ future in Sacramento, the team is staying for the long run with new ownership, marking a new era in the Capital City.</p>\n<p>The Kings aren’t a team that will be in contention for an NBA championship this season, but as a rebuilding year, Sacramento will be looking for growth and improvement, and lots of it. The team has compiled some solid pieces that should at the very least make the Kings competitive on a nightly basis.</p>\n<p>“We really have the pieces in place to be a special team,” point guard Isaiah Thomas said. “The goal is to make the playoffs. If everything comes together, if we play consistently and give it all we got, I think we can compete for one of those spots in the Western Conference.”</p>\n<p>Anchoring the franchise is center DeMarcus Cousins. The third-year player was just given a four-year, $62 million contract extension, showing the Kings’ faith that Cousins is their franchise player. Sacramento needs Cousins to step up as the team’s leader and be a consistent, dominant big man. Last season, Cousins averaged 17.1 points and 9.9 rebounds, but struggled with maturity. If Cousins can step up, he could change the path of the Kings in a very positive way.</p>\n<p>General Manager Pete D’Alessandro’s biggest offseason move was shipping off Tyreke Evans, which is a perfect symbol of the changing culture in Sacramento. No longer will the Kings be a selfish team, but will focus instead on selflessness and defense.</p>\n<p>Even without Evans, the Kings are deep at point guard. Competing for the starting role are Greivis Vasquez and Thomas. Vasquez is a pass-first point guard, ranking third in the NBA last season in assists at 9.0 per game. Thomas, on the other hand, is a quick fire cracker who, at just 5’9’’, can get underneath the defense. The opposing styles of the two should bode well for the Kings, giving the team plenty of choice for different situations.</p>\n<p>“Greivis is not the quickest of guards, but he’s big in size and can post up and use his body. Also, he can look over the defense and distribute the ball,” forward Jason Thompson said. “And Isaiah obviously isn’t the tallest guy there but has a huge heart and brings a lot of energy. He can really shoot the three-ball too.”</p>\n<p>Starting at the shooting guard position will be Marcus Thornton, a natural scorer. Also available is rookie Ben McLemore, a terrific shooter from Kansas. Malone also has a few options at the small forward shot with veteran John Salmons and Luc Mbah a Moute. Both are great defenders,and Salmons brings veteran leadership, entering his 12th NBA season.</p>\n<p>“John is a talented player. He’s been around the league a long time and he’s a versatile guy,” Malone said. “And bringing a guy like [Luc] into our culture is a huge bonus because of all the things he stands for: professionalism, hard work, defense and high character.”</p>\n<p>Possibly the deepest position for Sacramento is the power forward spot, with Thompson, Carl Landry and Patrick Patterson all viable options for the Kings. Thompson, the athletic, long big man, averaged 10.9 points and 6.7 rebounds per game last season.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know that there’s any other NBA team that has the depth that we have at the power forward,” Malone said. “They all bring something different to the table, but those are three players that deserve to be on the floor.”</p>\n<p>While Sacramento didn’t sign a marquee player to send them to be a shoe-in for the playoffs, the improvement for the Kings is evident. With so much unknown as to how everything will come together, the Kings could make some noise and show a glimmer of hope that they might return to their glory days.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Clippers</p>\n<p>Entering the NBA playoffs last season, it seemed L.A. had all the pieces to go far. But despite the incredible offensive firepower, the squad flopped when it mattered, falling to Memphis in the first round.</p>\n<p>Five months later, the Clippers still have a roster full of talent, keeping all core players intact. A different style though, will be on display as L.A. brought in a new head coach, Doc Rivers. Rivers will bring a more fluid, balanced offense to the Clippers as well as an emphasis on defense.</p>\n<p>Therefore, “lob city” is no more in L.A., but that shouldn’t matter. This should be a fun team to watch with two of the most exciting players in the league. Point guard Chris Paul is the first, averaging 16.9 points and 9.7 assists last season, second best in the league.</p>\n<p>Power forward Blake Griffin can fly high, throwing down monstrous dunks. Last season, he averaged 18 points and 8.3 rebounds as the go-to player for the Clippers. Playing next to Griffin is Jordan, the Clippers defensive presence with 1.4 blocks per game last season.</p>\n<p>The additions of J.J. Reddick and Darren Collison to solidify the shooting guard spot along with role players Matt Barnes and Jamal Crawford, the Clippers have compiled a roster that’s ready to win games.</p>\n<p>Last year, the LA team in red, white and blue won its first division title and earned 50 wins for the first time in its 44-year history. This year, the Clippers absolutely have the pieces to outright win it again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Los Angeles Lakers</p>\n<p>One thing will determine the Los Angeles Lakers’ success this year: injuries. The team is full of aging veterans, who together could be great, but have to remain on the floor.</p>\n<p>The Lakers lost many key players in the offseason, including Dwight Howard, Metta World Peace and Earl Clark, leaving plenty of pressure on three big players for L.A.</p>\n<p>Kobe Bryant, one of best players in the game, is still out after rupturing his Achilles tendon at the end of last season. He’s not expected for the season opener, but when he returns, he’ll be back to prove himself after people questioned whether the injury would end his career. Last season, the “Black Mamba” averaged 27.3 points per game on 57 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>The Lakers will always be dangerous with Bryant on the floor, but he is showing the very beginning signs of slowing down and needs to make sure he doesn’t come back too soon.</p>\n<p>Point guard Steve Nash only played in 50 games last year., but at 39, still has the ability to be great, averaging 12.7 points and 6.7 assists last season.</p>\n<p>And then there’s forward Pau Gasol, who is probably thrilled Howard is gone. The two didn’t mix well, and Gasol will finally own that big man role. As a result, the Lakers should expect an increase from his 13.7 points per game last year.</p>\n<p>One problem for the Lakers this season will be depth. They brought in Jordan Farmar and Chris Kaman, but their bench isn’t nearly as strong as it has been in years past.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Lakers could make the playoffs, but everything will have to go right.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Golden State Warriors</p>\n<p>The darlings of last year’s NBA playoffs return even stronger this year.</p>\n<p>To start, the team picked up veteran Andre Iguodala, an athletic small forward who can bring it on the defensive end as well as score, averaging 1.7 steals and 13.0 points per game last season. He adds a defensive presence to a team that is typically very offensive-minded.</p>\n<p>Of course, the most important player on the roster is Stephen Curry, who averaged 22.9 points and 6.9 assists last season. He shot just over 45 percent from behind the arc, setting an NBA record of 272 made threes.</p>\n<p>Combined with Klay Thompson, the duo scored 483 threes, more than any other twosome in NBA history.</p>\n<p>The focus on the three-point shot leaves plenty of space inside for both Andrew Bogut and David Lee. Lee averaged 18.5 points per game, second on the team last season, as well as 11.2 rebounds. Along with Iguodala, they should be able to go inside or out.</p>\n<p>What kept the Warriors from moving deeper in the playoffs last year was their inability to finish games. Now, the team has another year of experience under their belt and has added a few veterans, leaving the team extremely dangerous down the stretch of the season.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Phoenix Suns</p>\n<p>Every division needs its cellar dweller. In the Pacific Division, Phoenix is that team.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Suns finished at the bottom of Western conference at 25-57. Although the team hired a new head coach in NBA legend Jeff Hornacek, the team is still without any stars for him to work with.</p>\n<p>The team acquired guards Eric Bledsoe and Gerald Green, but lost Michael Beasley and second-leading scorer Luis Scola.</p>\n<p>The team will rely on point guard Goran Dragic to lead the team, which he did last year with 14.7 points and 7.4 assists per game.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appeared on page six of Oct. 9th’s print edition of the Daily Nexus.</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo by Kristen Henneman of the Daily Nexus.</em></p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-52399\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-52399\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2013-10-09/nba-preview-pacific-division/","id":602,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[601,600,599],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":5,"highestPage":15,"route":"/authors/71"}},"__N_SSG":true}
