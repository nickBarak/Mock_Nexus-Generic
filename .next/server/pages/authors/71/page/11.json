The loss was the first given up by UCSB to Northridge in Santa Barbara since the 1999 season.</p>\n<p>In a battle between the two best offensive teams in the Big West, the Matadors struck first on a shot by junior forward Beto Velasquez. Dribbling down the right sideline, Velasquez cut in and shot the ball on the ground, through sophomore keeper Austin Mansker’s legs and into the back of the net to give Northridge a 1-0 lead 31 minutes into the game.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>“We were playing with a defense that at best is extremely tired (from playing on Friday),” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “The goal we gave up was on a guy picking up the ball at half field and running 50 yards. That was disappointing.”</p>\n<p>Overall, the two teams shot an equal 12 shots, but UCSB was unable to convert any of its chances.</p>\n<p>“This [loss is] disappointing because I feel this is one we needed to win,” Vom Steeg said. “It was at home and yes, Northridge is a good team, but I knew today with our forwards attacking their defenders we would get four or five excellent opportunities. We needed somebody to step up and finish, and we didn’t get that.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s 2-1 double overtime thriller against Irvine, Ryan propelled UCSB to victory, scoring both goals for the Gauchos, including the game winner with just 24 seconds remaining. The win gave UCSB its first victory against the Anteaters since 2009.</p>\n<p>“As soon as [Ryan] got that goal, [I knew] it was by far the best win since I joined the team,” junior midfielder Fifi Baiden said.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara started the match strong, dominating possession. Yet, despite outshooting Irvine 8-4 in the first half, it was the Anteaters that got on the board first. On a counterattack, sophomore forward Lester Hayes III cut inside toward the goal and shot from just outside the 18-yard box. Hayes converted, putting the Gauchos down 1-0 to the lowest-ranked in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“For me, it was way too easy of a goal,” Vom Steeg said.</p>\n<p>Just over three minutes into the second half, senior forward Dion Acoff passed the ball to Ryan, who fired the ball into the far top corner of the net, tying the score 1-1.</p>\n<p>“What I said at halftime is that we’re not going to get shut out tonight,” Vom Steeg said. “We pushed a lot of players forward. We just needed one goal to change the momentum.”</p>\n<p>With time dwindling in the second overtime, Ryan took over. After taking a corner kick, which was then deflected back out to him, Ryan crossed the ball back into the box. It bounced twice in the box before passing an outstretched Irvine keeper and settling into the corner of the goal.</p>\n<p>As a team, UCSB outshot Irvine 21-13. Ryan led the attack for the Gauchos taking five shots, three of which were on goal.</p>\n<p>“He put the team on his back and gave us victory,” Baiden said. “He played well the whole game. He was incredible.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-48013\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-48013\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-08/ucsb-suffers-loss-season/","id":1632,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1631,1630,1629],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB to Play First Big West Home Games","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"This weekend holds a couple of firsts for the No. 4 UCSB men’s soccer team.

With six of its next seven games at home, the Gauchos should take advantage of playing at Harder Stadium.</p>\n<p>“It’s always fun to play on your home soil,” Baiden said. “You get the fans behind you. Whatever you have to do to get a win, you do.”</p>\n<p>In tonight’s matchup against rival UC Irvine, Santa Barbara will once again be looking for redemption. The Anteaters won both matches last season and are back-to-back Big West Champions, stealing the title from the Gauchos both times.</p>\n<p>Yet this year the Anteaters are struggling. The team holds a 3-7-1 overall record and is currently 0-2 in conference. Having lost five straight games, the Anteaters are hungry for a win, desperately needing to gain some type of momentum. “They’re a team that I think is fighting for their season on Friday night,” Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. “They’ve lost two league games and they’re hoping in one game they can turn things around. For them, that has to happen on Friday night.”</p>\n<p>This week, the focus has returned to the offense for the Gauchos. While UCSB was shut out for the fifth time this season last weekend against Cal State Fullerton, Santa Barbara has plenty of offensive weapons.</p>\n<p>Senior midfielder Nic Ryan ranks second in the Big West in game-winning goals with three and junior forward Dom Sarle is tied for second in conference in assists with four.</p>\n<p>“The key [against Irvine] is our offense,” Baiden said. “This week’s practice was about getting chances in the final third and being aggressive. We also have to play to our playmakers.”</p>\n<p>On Sunday, UCSB will see one of the tougher teams in conference. Northridge begins the weekend at 7-4 overall and ranks third in the Big West with a 1-1 conference record.</p>\n<p>Like the Gauchos, the Matadors are an offensive-minded team. Northridge puts up the most shots in the Big West with nearly 19 per game. They also average 2.18 goals per game, just slightly behind UCSB, which scores 2.3 goals per game.</p>\n<p>“The key to their success has been their ability to score goals,” Vom Steeg said. “They have at least two players that if you give them an open shot, they can hit the ball very well and they’re comfortable around the net.”</p>\n<p>In fact, Northridge currently holds two of the best scorers in the Big West. Sophomore forward Sagi Lev-Ari leads the Big West in goals with nine and sophomore forward Edwin Rivas is tied for second in points with six goals and one assist.</p>\n<p>“If those players get isolated or are left open, then they can hurt you,” Vom Steeg said. “Defensively, our emphasis will be on knowing where they are and [making sure] they’re picked up so that they have to work hard to get the ball and create opportunities.”</p>\n<p>Kickoff against UC Irvine is set for 7 p.m. tonight. Sunday’s game against Northridge is scheduled for 5 p.m.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47968\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47968\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-05/ucsb-play-big-west-home-games/","id":1625,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1624,1623,1622],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Opens Big West, Still Undefeated","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"The No. 3 UCSB men’s soccer team remained undefeated after opening up Big West play on the road with a 3-1 win over No. 24 UC Riverside on Friday and a 0-0 draw with Cal State Fullerton Sunday night...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>The No. 3 UCSB men’s soccer team remained undefeated after opening up Big West play on the road with a 3-1 win over No. 24 UC Riverside on Friday and a 0-0 draw with Cal State Fullerton Sunday night.</p>\n<p>The Gauchos improved to 7-0-3 overall and 1-0-1 in conference.

On average, the Gauchos score 2.5 goals per game.</p>\n<p>“I think we were unlucky because we had good chances,” senior midfielder Nic Ryan said.</p>\n<p>In the game, Santa Barbara outshot Fullerton 17-9, including 5-2 in shots on goal.</p>\n<p>The best chance to score, though, belonged to Fullerton in the second half, when sophomore midfielder Ian Ramos found himself one-on-one with Gaucho keeper Austin Mansker due to a counterattack. Luckily for the Gauchos, Mansker made the save on Fullerton’s only shot on goal in regulation.</p>\n<p>“He broke out and I thought we did a good job of running with him,” Vom Steeg said. “Fortunately, Austin was very good.”</p>\n<p>In the 80th minute, junior defender Daniel Welsh received a red card, forcing UCSB to play a man down the rest of the match.</p>\n<p>“You hope to still find a goal to win the game but at that point, you don’t want to lose the game,” Vom Steeg said. “We had to change our tactics.”</p>\n<p>In Friday’s clash of ranked teams, UCSB did what it was unable to do all of last season: beat Riverside.</p>\n<p>“We lost to them twice last year,” Ryan said. “Knowing we only got to play them once, it feels good [to beat them].”</p>\n<p>Aiding the Gauchos to victory was the play of freshman forward Charlie Miller, who tallied a goal and an assist in his first start of the season.</p>\n<p>“We needed that kind of performance [from Miller],” Vom Steeg said. “Somebody had to step up for us and on that night it was Charlie.”</p>\n<p>Miller began the game as a playmaker. Gaining possession on the edge of the Highlanders’ goal box, Miller passed the ball to freshman midfielder Ema Boateng in the 13th minute, who scored and put the Gauchos on the board first.</p>\n<p>After a Riverside goal in the first half, the score remained deadlocked until the 70th minute when Nic Ryan drove down the sideline and fired a shot from 18 yards out. The senior midfielder connected to score his fourth goal of the season.</p>\n<p>A red card given to the Highlanders with about 10 minutes remaining gave the Gauchos a one man advantage for the rest of the game. UCSB quickly took advantage, scoring 19 seconds later when senior forward Dion Acoff centered the ball to Miller, who then scored.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47751\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-01/ucsb-opens-big-west-undefeated/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47751\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-01/ucsb-opens-big-west-undefeated/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-01/ucsb-opens-big-west-undefeated/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-01/ucsb-opens-big-west-undefeated/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-10-01/ucsb-opens-big-west-undefeated/","id":1658,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[1657,1656,1655],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Sets Sights on NCAA Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Soccer","publish_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"UCSB men’s soccer has set high expectations for its season in hopes of once again returning to the elite of college soccer. “It’s all about winning a national championship this year,” senior m...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>UCSB men’s soccer has set high expectations for its season in hopes of once again returning to the elite of college soccer.</p>\n<p>“It’s all about winning a national championship this year,” senior midfielder Machael David said. “I think we have the talent and coaches to win.”</p>\n<p>To begin the season, the Gauchos rank No. 11 in the nation and took all 18 first- place votes in the newly established Big West North Division.

The team lost incredible goal scorers in Sam Garza and Luis Silva, but the Gaucho’s recruiting class was voted tenth in the nation by College Soccer News.</p>\n<p>“People won’t even notice that Silva and Garza are gone,” David said. “The new recruits are unbelievable. They blend with the team really well.”</p>\n<p>One player expected to help fill the gaps and score goals is freshman midfielder Ema Boateng, the Gatorade National High School Player of the Year for men’s soccer.</p>\n<p>“He is fast … you can’t stop him,” David said. “People don’t know what’s coming, but he’s going to cause trouble. He’s going to score goals.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Dion Acoff also joins the team after transferring from Creighton where he was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection. Acoff was named to the 2012 Preseason All- Conference Team along with David and senior defender Peter McGlynn.</p>\n<p>Also joining the midfield for the Gauchos is junior Goffin Boyoko. Boyoko transferred from Auburn University Montgomery, where he earned 2011 NAIA First Team All-American and All-Southern States Athletic Conference First Team honors.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got really experienced players coming into the program, so they have a feel for college soccer,” Baiden said. “We have a deep team. There is somebody ready to step in at every position.” Returning for UCSB to aid the attack is junior forward Dom Sarle, and senior midfielders Josue Madueno and David. Both Sarle and Madueno were 2011 All- Big West players. David looks to return after missing significant time due to injury.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a group show because everyone can score goals, even our defenders,” David said. “Last year we looked to Silva; this year everyone can score.”</p>\n<p>On the defensive end, UCSB returns the majority of its starting lineup, including junior defender Peter Schmetz, Baiden and senior midfielder Nic Ryan.

\r\n</script> \n<p>“It was unique because I’d only had one week to work out with our current team,” Mitchell said. “We went on the road in July and we tried to get a top 10 or 12 list just by watching kids play 10 or 12 games with their AAU programs. After that first set of evaluations, we had things narrowed down and we got on the phone and started recruiting these kids like we’d been recruiting them since they were in eighth or ninth grade.”</p>\n<p>The three new recruits will have to help fill the shoes of two outstanding seniors, guard Emilie Johnson and forward Kelsey Adrian. Johnson led the team in scoring at 9.5 points per game, assisted with 2.8 per game and stole with .9 this season. Adrian averaged 6.5 points per game and served as the Gauchos’ three-point threat, leading the team in three-point percentage at 35.8.</p>\n<p>“They gave all they could to the program,” Mitchell said. “Like with all seniors, you respect them, but you move on to the next group.”</p>\n<p>When looking for players, Mitchell had one very key characteristic in mind: versatility.</p>\n<p>“They’re very versatile players,” Mitchell said. “After seeing our team play this year, people know that unless you’re 6’5’’, to me our two, three and four positions are interchangeable. They give us some height on the wings because we were extremely small at times this year and it affected us on the defensive side.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jasmine Ware</strong></p>\n<p>5-foot-10 guard Ware comes to UCSB from Sacramento High. Named the 86th-best guard in the nation by ESPN, Ware averaged 14.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.0 steals and 2.0 assists per game last season.</p>\n<p>“I think a lot of coaches probably know they missed one with Jasmine,” Mitchell said. “She’s a defensive stopper. I watched her guard a 6’2’’ kid in a high school game and control the entire game with her defensive mentality.”</p>\n<p>Ware led her team to a 27-7 overall record and a 14-0 mark in league.</p>\n<p>“[Ware] knows how to win and she’s also going to bring the energy that maybe the personality of our kids didn’t have this year,” Mitchell said. “We need to continue to grow with that aspect and know it’s okay to play with a lot of emotion. Jasmine’s going to be one of those that refuses to lose.”</p>\n<p>While Ware is known for her offensive ability, Mitchell looks to take advantage of Ware’s defensive versatility, claiming she could guard positions one through four. “She’s legit 5’10’’, but she plays a lot bigger,” Mitchell said. “She’s extremely long and athletic and just lightning quick from end to end. She’ll be able to help us at times because we struggled to guard bigger, more physical guards.”</p>\n<p><strong>Kendra Morrison</strong></p>\n<p>At first look, Morrison seems very similar to Adrian. Both are versatile players, listed at over six feet tall, but play on the wing and shoot well from behind the arc with Morrison shooting at 33 percent. “Probably the biggest difference, and Kelsey did this later in the season for us to have a chance to win, is that Kendra is really physical,” Mitchell said. “She’s going to want to post at times, so [while] Kelsey came in having the reputation as a shooter, Kendra’s going to be a scorer because she’ll post up and find a way to get to the free throw line.” Last season, Morrison averaged 16.0 points, 8.2 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, 1.5 assists and 1.7 steals per game at Eastlake High in Sammamish, Wash. With a height of 6’1”, Morrison is known as a rebounding guard who can also handle the ball extremely well.</p>\n<p>“We’ll have [sophomore Nicole Nesbit] running the point 90 percent of the time and [sophomore Melissa Zornig] will probably see some time backing her up, but I would never hesitate [to play Kendra],” Mitchell said. “Kendra’s one of those that if you ask her to play one, two, three and four, she has that ability. [She’s] just a blue- collar, ‘I’m going to find a way to win’ [player] and she’s willing to do all the team things.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jessica Pino</strong></p>\n<p>After averaging 12.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.5 blocks, 3.3 assists and 1.4 steals last season, MaxPreps named Pino the 73rd-best player in California.</p>\n<p>“It was funny because she was the first kid on campus when I took the job and her dad was her high school coach and he said she could play the one, two or three,” Mitchell said. “And we went and saw her play and watched some film and I said, ‘She’ll be a dominating four player before she’s done here because of her size.’”</p>\n<p>This 6-foot-3 forward from Chaparral High in Temecula brings height to a UCSB team that was undersized all of last season. Pino also played volleyball, and as a result is known for her athleticism and jumping ability. Mitchell expects her to also play some center.</p>\n<p>“She’s a great passer from the high post area and we do a lot of high-low action,” Mitchell said. “She’s very comfortable shooting the 17-footer or three-pointers at times. She’ll bring that length that we didn’t have.”</p>\n<p>Mitchell’s first recruiting class will join nine returners, including Big West Tournament MVP and junior center Kirsten Tilleman. Tilleman averaged 6.8 points and 8.4 rebounds (a team high), finding her offensive stride later in the season. In the championship, Tilleman tallied a double-double with 16 points and 11 boards.</p>\n<p>Yet, according to Mitchell, Tilleman may not be the one to step up as the leader, or at least not vocally.</p>\n<p>“I think the person who has taken a backseat her entire career that’s been a great leader for us right now is [junior guard] Angelei Aguirre,” Mitchell said. “Angelei is a little more vocal and where Tilleman is getting out of her comfort level a little more, she always leads by example.”</p>\n<p>With the looks of her team, Mitchell has high hopes for her squad next season.</p>\n<p>“They understand me and what this coach staff wants from them a bit more,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully we’ll get off to a better start next season. We have an extremely difficult, tough schedule, though, (which includes UNLV, BYU, USC and Washington), so we’ll be challenged early and we’ll see our resiliency and if that prepares us for Big West play.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-47113\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-47113\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-23/big-west-champs-fill-gaps/","id":720,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[719,718,717],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"The Seventh Wonder of the World","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Columns/Features","publish_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"As a freshman at UCSB, Barbara Nwaba didn’t know what the heptathlon was.

Even during her first season here at UCSB, Nwaba simply specialized in the hurdles. Yet, former Track and Field coach Josh Priester saw something more and began training Nwaba in her sophomore season for the heptathlon, a race that takes place over two days and involves seven events: the 100-meter hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200-meter run, long jump, javelin throw and 800 meter run.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Immediately, Nwaba took to the event. She ran her first heptathlon March 13 and 14, 2009 at the Sam Adams Combined Events and earned a score of 4772, breaking the school record of 4767 set by Erika Bornhorst in 1996.</p>\n<p>“My high school coach mentioned [the heptathlon], but I had no idea what it was,” Nwaba said. “Then, [when I was a sophomore], the coach here thought I’d be really good at it. I was really scared, but my first time out I broke the school record, so I was like, ‘I’ll keep with this.’”</p>\n<p>Since then, Nwaba’s success seems endless. In 2010, Nwaba was named an NCAA All-American and broke her own UCSB record twice in the heptathlon, including at the Big West Championships, where Nwaba scored 5,552 and won the event.</p>\n<p>“She’s done so much for the program and you know when she steps onto the track, she’s going to put 110 percent into it,” senior Ryan Martin said. “Pretty much every time she competes, she’s PR’ing. I know she wants to do great things and I think she’s going to.”</p>\n<p>This April at the Sam Adams Multi-Events, Nwaba finished the heptathlon with a phenomenal score of 5,986. The score was not only a personal best for Nwaba, but was good enough to break the overall Big West Conference record. As a result, Nwaba also earned the No. 1 ranking in the nation in the heptathlon.</p>\n<p>“That day was so perfect,” Nwaba said. “Day one went really well — way better than I was expecting. I wasn’t worrying, I was just competing. To see how close I was to 6000, it was a great day.”</p>\n<p>Two weekends ago in the Big West Multi-Event Championships, Nwaba won again with a score of 5,709 and surpassed the conference record set by Sharon Day four years ago in 2008. “I was a little disappointed by the score, but I still broke the record, so I felt I accomplished something,” Nwaba said. “I’ve come a long way. It was good to get a win there because the first time [I competed there,] I came in third.”</p>\n<p>After the victory, Nwaba earned her fourth consecutive Big West Athlete of the Week honors.</p>\n<p>“I remember at the beginning of the year I thought it would be cool to get one [Big West Athlete of the Week award], and now to have four is amazing,” Nwaba said. “I’m happy I’m doing so well this year.”</p>\n<p>While Nwaba has proven to be the best heptathlete to compete at UCSB, she strives for perfection and is never happy with just a win.</p>\n<p>“To get a PR is a good feeling so that reinforces you to keep [training],” Nwaba said. “And I’m competitive with myself.”</p>\n<p>The training is strenuous, but for Nwaba, has always kept practice interesting.</p>\n<p>“There’s a lot more hours [of practice] because there are so many events, so it’s so hard to get them all in during the week,” Nwaba said. “It takes a lot of dedication when you have to master seven events, but it’s definitely fun.”</p>\n<p>The determination may pay off, as this summer, Nwaba will have a shot at earning one of three heptathlon spots at the Olympic Games in London. Like most athletes, the Olympics have been the ultimate dream for Nwaba as long as she can remember.</p>\n<p>“In the last Olympics, it [gave] me chills to see [the track athletes] cross the line and win,” Nwaba said. “I want to excel and I know that’s the biggest accomplishment ever, so that pushes me.”</p>\n<p>Nwaba’s dream could very well become a reality. She is currently No. 2 in the nation in the heptathlon behind senior Brianne Theisen. The last two years, Nwaba has also taken a step toward her dream by competing at the USA Nationals. Nwaba placed eighth this year, but knows she can do better.</p>\n<p>“It was defining to be with girls whose scores were so big, but I knew I could do just as well,” Nwaba said. “I started to feel like, ‘I could beat this girl. I can compete with them.’ I didn’t really believe [my dream was possible] until I was competing [there] with the U.S. National Team.”</p>\n<p>Olympic trials will be held in Eugene, Oregon, beginning June 21.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely going to be hard because there are three great heptathletes in the U.S., but she has a chance,” Martin said. “If she competes well in the trials she could do it.”</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46948\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46948\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-05-16/seventh-world/","id":3174,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[3173,3172,3171],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Kelsey Adrian: Clutch Canadian","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/kenneth-song_womens-basketball-kelsey-adrian-profile-4.png?resize=355%2C230&ssl=1","mobile_thumbnail":"https://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/kenneth-song_womens-basketball-kelsey-adrian-profile-4.png?resize=800%2C428&ssl=1","description":"To win a championship, a team needs players who step up in big moments.

For the UCSB women’s basketball team this past season, Kelsey Adrian was one of those players.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey’s always had a reputation as a clutch shooter and she steps up big at the end of the season,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “To win a championship, you have to have all the pieces to the puzzle and Kelsey was a big piece.”</p>\n<p>One of Adrian’s big moments came early in the season against one of the Gauchos’ toughest opponents: Washington. Coming off the bench, the senior forward shot 4-6 from behind the arc. In 18 minutes, she tallied 14 points, 38 percent of the Gauchos’ game total. Subsequently, Adrian’s role as a bench player was done.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n\r\nfunction myAdDoneFunction(spotx_ad_found) { if(spotx_ad_found) {} else {}}; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction mobileAndTabletcheck() { \r\n\r\nvar check = false; \r\n\r\n (function(a){if(/(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino|android|ipad|playbook|silk/i.test(a)||/1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(a.substr(0,4)))check = true})(navigator.userAgent||navigator.vendor||window.opera); \r\n\r\nreturn check; \r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nvar bMobile = mobileAndTabletcheck(), \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes = [\r\n\r\n'type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://search.spotxchange.com/js/spotx.js\" data-spotx_ad_done_function=\"myAdDoneFunction\" data-spotx_ad_unit=\"incontent\" data-spotx_autoplay=\"1\" data-spotx_ad_volume=\"0\" data-spotx_loop=\"0\" data-spotx_collapse=\"1\" data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"'\r\n\r\n];\r\n\r\nif (bMobile) \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"304\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"171\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"128967\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse \r\n\r\n{ \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_width=\"608\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_content_height=\"342\"'); \r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_unmute_on_mouse=\"1\"');\r\n\r\naScriptAttributes.push('data-spotx_channel_id=\"108869\"');\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ndocument.write('<scr' + 'ipt ' + aScriptAttributes.join(\" \") + '></scr' + 'ipt>'); \r\n</script> \n<p>Although her effort wasn’t enough to carry the Gauchos over Washington as the team lost 46-37, Adrian emerged as the team’s premier three-point shooter.</p>\n<p>“When Kelsey can get her feet set, she’s a deadly shooter,” Head Coach Carlene Mitchell said. “That [game] showed us that when she gets hot and she shoots with confidence, she’s able to hit any three available to her.”</p>\n<p>Over the course of the season, the Langley, British Columbia native averaged 1.5 threes per game, shooting 36.4 percent from downtown. Not only were both numbers team bests, but they ranked Adrian sixth in the Big West.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey represented a ‘pro-type’ guard because she’s right at six feet,” Mitchell said. “It was easier for us to get her a shot because she’s got a quick release and because of her size.”</p>\n<p>In 62 games at UCSB after transferring from Cal, Adrian’s name is now found in the record books for total three-pointers. She finished with 100, good enough for seventh all-time.</p>\n<p>“[Kelsey’s] been my go-to player,” Johnson said. “As a point guard, you have to have that shooter, and she was that player for me. I always knew where she was on the court because she’d be ready to knock down the big shot.”</p>\n<p>Another monumental game for Adrian took place on the road against Cal State Northridge, in which UCSB won 71-67 in double overtime, proving that the Gauchos could contend with the best in the league. Prior to the game, Mitchell challenged both seniors to set the tone for their team.</p>\n<p>“What I wanted Kelsey to realize is that she’s not just a shooter,” Mitchell said. “I wanted her to be a scorer. Kelsey needed to find a way to score, whether it be rebound put backs, posting up or getting to free throw line.”</p>\n<p>Adrian responded with 17 points, tying her career high. She shot 7-13 from the field, including 3-6 from three-point land and tallied eight rebounds. Adrian’s stats weren’t just big; she made the big plays too. She hit a critical three that eventually brought the game to overtime and came up with a steal at the end to clinch the game.</p>\n<p>“In that game, I knew I needed to do more for the team for us to win,” Adrian said. “I tried to be more aggressive and I think that showed.”</p>\n<p>A little over a month later, Adrian topped her career-tying offensive performance. Defeating UC Davis on the road 60-56 in a game which gave the team momentum heading into the playoffs, Adrian tallied a career-high 21 points. She shot 7-13 from the field and 4-8 from behind the arc.</p>\n<p>“Since I had been at UCSB, I hadn’t beat Davis,” Adrian said. “I was not going to go out in the last game, last time playing Davis, and [lose].”</p>\n<p>Adrian’s impact wasn’t only on the offensive end. In many games, Adrian defended the opposition’s best shooter. Against Davis, Adrian was given the task of guarding the smaller Hannah Stephens, who scored 16 points, including four threes, in the first matchup. The second time around, Adrian held Stephens to just five points.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey’s length creates a problem [for opponents] and she doesn’t have to guard [them] as close as Emilie or Nicole,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Then, in the playoffs, Adrian made the needed plays. In the second half of the first-round matchup against UC Irvine, a late charge and trey from Adrian helped clinch the 61-51 victory.</p>\n<p>“It’s funny because everyone asks me [if I like taking the big shots,] but during the game, I’m not thinking about it,” Adrian said. “When you’re in the middle of the game, it’s just another shot, which works for me because I’m not thinking about the time and pressure.”</p>\n<p>Then, Adrian hit another crucial three in the championship. After going down 40-41, she put a dagger into Long Beach with a three that gave UCSB a lead with 7:20 remaining, which was never relinquished.</p>\n<p>“Some players shy away from late game [opportunities], but when you put in the time, that’s why you play the game,” Mitchell said. “She has that killer instinct. We wanted somebody taking those shots that has ice in their veins and that’s Kelsey.”</p>\n<p>Adrian tallied just six points in the game, but her impact was felt far beyond the box score.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t even have to score a point,” Mitchell said. “Her steady play and calmness … she’s been there before and everyone fed off of that.”</p>\n<p>In fact, personal stats were never the priority for Adrian. It was always about the team. While her numbers were down this season, averaging 6.6 points this year compared to 9.2 last season the team accomplishments were far superior. For Adrian, a championship was the best way to leave her mark on the Gauchos’ program.</p>\n<p>“Kelsey’s impact goes beyond [the numbers],” Johnson said. “It makes me really happy when she puts up those huge games on the stat sheet, but she doesn’t care whether she has two points or 20. For her, all that matters is the win.”</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-46234\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-46234\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-04-19/kelsey-adrian-clutch-canadian/","id":714,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[713,712,711],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Mitchell Recognized as Rookie Head Coach of Year Finalist","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"After a year in which UCSB women’s basketball Head Coach Carlene Mitchell led her team to a Big West Conference Tournament Championship and an NCAA tournament birth, the first-year coach was named o...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>After a year in which UCSB women’s basketball Head Coach Carlene Mitchell led her team to a Big West Conference Tournament Championship and an NCAA tournament birth, the first-year coach was named one of three finalists for the Spalding Maggie Dixon Division I Rookie Head Coach of the Year Award.

Ending the half on an 11-2 run, Baylor took a dominant 46-16 halftime lead and coasted through the second half.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t convert [our open shots], which put us in a hole,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “It’s hard to play a perfect game, but [when] we put together a complete game, we’re a team to be reckoned with.”</p>\n<p>Baylor junior center Brittney Griner finished with 14 points in 22 minutes, her 75th consecutive game in double figures.</p>\n<p>“I think Tilleman did an amazing job on [Griner], but she’s 6’8’’ and she’s played with the USA team,” Mitchell said. “I give our kids credit because she had to work hard for her points.”</p>\n<p>UCSB’s defensive game plan was to make Baylor’s role players win the game. Five players for the Lady Bears were in double figures and, as a team, it shot a phenomenal 58.7%.</p>\n<p>“The role players stepped up,” Johnson said. “When they’re shooting threes and have 6’8’’ Brittney Griner, they’re absolutely the best team in the nation.”</p>\n<p>Due to the team’s height advantage Baylor dominated the paint, outscoring the Gauchos 42-18.

Junior forward Brooklyn Pope finished with 13 points and seven boards, making her impact in the second half.</p>\n<p>As one of the best defensive teams in the nation, holding opponents to just 30.7 percent shooting, Baylor pressured UCSB’s offense. Although UCSB committed a bearable 16 turnovers, the Bears scored 24 points off those giveaways. The Gauchos also struggled to find any offensive rhythm, suffering six shot clock violations, and failed to hit many open shots. UCSB shot 26.7 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>“They’re long and athletic,” Mitchell said. “We’ve faced teams that our guards have had a hard time getting their shots off, but you can’t emulate the speed and athleticism of Baylor.”</p>\n<p>In her final game as a Gaucho, Johnson led the Gauchos offensively with 10 points. Johnson finished in double figures in 14 of the last 17 games.</p>\n<p>“I wish I had hit more shots, but I just tried to help my team in any way I could,” Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Tilleman, who was matched up with Griner, also had a solid performance, tallying eight points and eight boards.

Griner has averaged 9.4 rebounds and 23.3 points per game throughout the season, the latter of which is good enough for sixth-best in the country, and also tops the nation with 5.1 blocks per game.</p>\n<p>“We’ll watch some films of games that maybe teams held her below thirty,” Mitchell said. “That might give us an idea of some things we can do, but we’re so undersized that it’s going to take a bit of creativity to see if we can slow her down.”</p>\n<p>At 6’8’’, Griner will have a seven-inch height advantage over UCSB junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who was named MVP of the Big West tournament with her 16-point, 11-rebound effort in the championship. Tilleman ranks second in the Big West in rebounds with 8.4 per game.</p>\n<p>“People have called me an undersized post player ever since I came to college, but I think anyone’s undersized compared to her,” Tilleman said. “It’s funny because coach [once] asked me if I would ever want to guard her and I was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’ You have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain.”</p>\n<p>With Griner leading the way, the Bears have been unstoppable offensively, averaging 78.8 points per game while shooting a nation-best 49 percent from the field. On the defensive end, Baylor dominates too, grabbing 45.7 boards and holding teams to 30.7 percent shooting.</p>\n<p>“They’re going to create some different problems with their athleticism,” Mitchell said. “They pick the ball up full court and wear you down. They just keep bringing athletes at you.”</p>\n<p>Another key match-up will be the point guard position. Senior guard Emilie Johnson, the leading scorer for the Gauchos averaging 9.8 points per game, will face off against one of the best point guards in the nation, sophomore Odyssey Sims. Sims averages 14.8 points per game.</p>\n<p>“[We have to] limit the role players because we know [Griner’s] going to make a difference,” Johnson said. “We know she’s going to score and we know she’s going to get some blocks, but it we limit the role players, we have a chance to be in the game.”</p>\n<p>Senior forward Kelsey Adrian’s versatility at 6’2’’ should be an area in which the Gauchos could take advantage. Adrian is the team’s leading three-point shooter at 36.8 percent, and has hit at least two three pointers in eight of the last 10 games.</p>\n<p>“It’s about having the mentality that we deserve to be there,” Johnson said. “We earned our way just like everybody else and no matter the number in front of our name, we still put in the work and effort. We’re going to play hard and embrace the opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 11:30 on Sunday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45704\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45704\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-19/gauchos-face-1-baylor-ncaas/","id":712,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[711,710,709],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Women Complete Storybook Ending With Win Over Long Beach State in Big West Championship","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"  In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince — a Big West Championship and an automatic berth into the Big Dance.

At the end of the day, this is why you play the game–for March Madness and a chance to cut down nets.”</p>\n<p>It was a tough regular season for the Gauchos indeed. After winning the Big West a season ago, UC Santa Barbara experienced a lot of change, beginning with a new Head Coach. For a while, it seemed as if the team would be the first since 1989-90 to not finish over .500 in conference.</p>\n<p>The team was not going to give up though and all season long, Mitchell reiterated that her team would peak when it mattered most in March and that winning the Big West title would be the greatest legacy her team, especially the seniors could leave. The Gauchos won nine of their last 11 games.</p>\n<p>“I honestly think that just set it up for a better story,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “When we were at that low point, I never stopped believing and I knew this team could do something special. All the hard times that we went through this year…I wouldn’t trade it for this moment right now.”</p>\n<p>And as the title game came to a close, it was evident in the team the obstacles they had faced and overcame. With under a minute left, Johnson exited from her final Big West game with tears of joy and as that final buzzer sounded, the team flooded the court. Johnson, along with senior forward Kelsey Adrian, was embraced in celebration. The team couldn’t get those championship t-shirt on quicker.</p>\n<p>“To the world, we’ve probably done the impossible, but to me it’s everything I expected when I took this job,” Mitchell said. “Like I told them, it would’ve been easy for them to jump ship with a new coach and a change in philosophy, but at the end of the day, the seniors led the way. They wanted to leave their legacy, which was a Big West Championship, so I only have to thank them for believing in me.”</p>\n<p>Playing for the seniors were their teammates. The player of the game and MVP of the tournament was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who tallied 16 points and 11 boards. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig was named to the All-tournament team, averaging a tremendous 16.7 in the final three games.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting that… I wasn’t thinking about awards like that,” Tilleman said. “It’s really just a reflection of my teammates and my coaches. They make it possible for anybody on this team to step up any given night. It’s a great feeling right now.”</p>\n<p>And then there is Mitchell, who won a Big West title in her first year ever as a Head Coach. Coming from well-respected Rutgers, the players bought into her defensive mindset and rode it all the way to a title.</p>\n<p>“When someone is able to push you, but still allow you to have fun, that makes you want to play for them,” Tilleman said. “I want to play for Coach Mitch and I think that’s showing on the floor from the whole team.”</p>\n<p>The first half certainly exhibited UCSB’s defense as the team went into halftime with a marginal 21-20 lead. Both teams shot approximately 28 percent from the field.</p>\n<p>After taking a nine point lead to begin the second half, Long Beach took a timeout and the 49’ers responded. Freshman guard Alex Sanchez sparked a 13-3 run and the Beach took its first lead on a three point bomb from sophomore guard Hallie Meneses.</p>\n<p>UCSB’s leading three point shooter, Adrian, answered with a trey of her own to give the Gauchos a two-point lead, a lead they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>“We were feeling it in the second half,” Zornig said. “As a shooter, you have to keep your confidence up and keep shooting the ball no matter what.”</p>\n<p>The best player on both teams struggled. Both Johnson and Long Beach senior Tipesa Moorer were held scoreless. For the 49’ers, Sanchez led the team offensively with 17 points, while freshman Devin Hudson also contributed 15 points and 14 boards.</p>\n<p>After scoring just 21 points in the first half, UCSB shot 51.7 percent from the field in the second half and put 42 points on the board, double of what the team scored in the first period. That would be enough to give UCSB its 14th title, the most in Big West history.</p>\n<p>“I have to thank Coach Stringer for preparing me for this opportunity, but I told the young ladies before the game, ‘I’ve worn my national championship ring and my Big East Championship ring,’” Mitchell said. “I told them that I would take them off and never wear them again because I’m a Gaucho, but they had to get me a ring today and that’s what they did.”</p>\n<p>To reach the championship game, the Gauchos put a complete game together. They defeated Pacific 84-66 and got revenge on the team that knocked them out in the first round the year before.</p>\n<p>“We came in with a chip on our shoulder, knowing how horrible it felt last year to top the conference and lose to one of the last seeds on your home floor,” Nesbit said. “So when we came out here, we knew we had to play a solid forty minutes to get the win.”</p>\n<p>While known for playing in low scoring games, it was impossible to guess that the Gauchos were dead last in scoring. The 84 points is a season high for UCSB and three players finished with at least 20 points for the Gauchos. Zornig and Nesbit, finished with 23 and 20 points, respectively. Both are career highs for the sophomore guards. Johnson also finished with 20 points, hitting 10-12 at the free throw line to clinch the game.</p>\n<p>“I was struggling a bit during season and this is the time to turn it on,” Zornig said. “I wanted to come in, step up, and do whatever I can to help this team win.”</p>\n<p>After taking a 37-28 lead into halftime, UOP immediately closed the gap to four to begin the second half. However, UCSB pulled away, tallying 47 second half points.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for [Emilie] and Kelsey to have a chance for a Big West Championship,” Mitchell said. “It means everything to me even though I’ve only had a year to coach them. As seniors, they’ve meant so much to this program. We’re jumping on their backs and seeing how far they can take us.”</p>\n<p>With a Big West Championship and a potential run in the NCAA tournament, the Gauchos have certainly left their legacy.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45606\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45606\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/ucsb-women-complete-storybook-win-long-beach-state-big-west-championship/","id":744,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[743,742,741],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Bring Home the Hardware","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince this past weekend in Anaheim: a Big West championship and an automatic berth in th...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p>In ending its Cinderella story season, the UCSB women’s basketball team brought home something better than a prince this past weekend in Anaheim: a Big West championship and an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.</p>\n<p>It was the first time a No. 6 seed has ever won the Big West Tournament, as the Gauchos overcame Long Beach State 63-54, beating three teams in their journey to the title.</p>\n<p>“To the world, we’ve probably done the impossible, but to me it’s everything I expected when I took this job,” Mitchell said. “Like I told them, it would’ve been easy for them to jump ship with a new coach and a change in philosophy, but at the end of the day, the seniors led the way.

For much of this season, it seemed as if the team would be the first since 1989-90 to not finish over .500 in conference.</p>\n<p>Mitchell reiterated all season long that her team would peak when it mattered most in March, and that winning the Big West title would be the greatest legacy her team, especially the seniors, could leave.</p>\n<p>The squad responded over the past few weeks, winning nine of its final 11 games.</p>\n<p>“I honestly think that just set it up for a better story,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “When we were at that low point, I never stopped believing and I knew this team could do something special.”</p>\n<p>Playing for the seniors were their teammates. The player of the game and MVP of the tournament was junior center Kirsten Tilleman, who tallied 16 points and 11 boards, eight on the offensive end. Sophomore guard Melissa Zornig was named to the All-tournament team, averaging a tremendous 16.7 in the final three games.</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting that… I wasn’t thinking about awards like that,” Tilleman said. “It’s really just a reflection of my teammates and my coaches. They make it possible for anybody on this team to step up any given night. It’s a great feeling right now.”</p>\n<p>And then there is Mitchell, who won a Big West title in her first year ever as a Head Coach. Coming from well-respected Rutgers, the players bought into her defensive mindset and rode it all the way to a title.</p>\n<p>“When someone is able to push you, but still allow you to have fun, that makes you want to play for them,” Tilleman said. “I want to play for Coach Mitch and I think that’s showing on the floor from the whole team.”</p>\n<p>The first half certainly exhibited UCSB’s defense as the team went into halftime with a marginal 21-20 lead. Both teams shot approximately 28 percent from the field through the opening 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>After taking a quick nine-point lead in the second half, Long Beach responded with a 13-3 run and the 49’ers took their first lead on a three point bomb from sophomore guard Hallie Meneses.</p>\n<p>Adrian, UCSB’s leading three-point shooter, answered with a trey of her own to give the Gauchos a two-point lead that they would never relinquish.</p>\n<p>“We were feeling it in the second half,” Zornig said. “As a shooter, you have to keep your confidence up and keep shooting the ball no matter what.”</p>\n<p>The best player on both teams struggled. Both Johnson and Long Beach senior Tipesa Moorer were held scoreless. For the 49’ers, Sanchez led the team offensively with 17 points, while freshman Devin Hudson also contributed 15 points and 14 boards.</p>\n<p>After scoring just 21 points in the first half, UCSB shot 51.7 percent from the field in the second half and put 42 points on the board, double of what the team scored in the first period.</p>\n<p>“I told the young ladies before the game, ‘I’ve worn my national championship ring and my Big East Championship ring,’” Mitchell said. “I told them that I would take them off and never wear them again because I’m a Gaucho, but they had to get me a ring today and that’s what they did.”</p>\n<p>To reach the championship, the Gauchos had to first overcome a University of Pacific squad that had beaten them during both of the teams’ regular season meetings. UCSB’s 84 points against UOP was a season high, and three players finished with at least 20 points for the Gauchos. Zornig and Nesbit finished with career highs of 23 and 20 points apiece, while Johnson tallied 20 of her own on 10-12 shooting from the free throw line.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for [Emilie] and Kelsey to have a chance for a Big West Championship,” Mitchell said. “It means everything to me even though I’ve only had a year to coach them. As seniors, they’ve meant so much to this program. We’re jumping on their backs and seeing how far they can take us.”</p>\n<p>UCSB now faces Baylor in first round action of the NCAA women’s basketball tournament next Sunday, March 18.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45609\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45609\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-12/gauchos-bring-home-hardware/","id":745,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[744,743,742],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Gauchos Face Test Against Pacific in Second Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"With momentum on its side and a Big West championship two games within reach, the UCSB women’s basketball team heads to the Honda Center to take on Pacific this afternoon.

The whole team was really disappointed, so we’re excited to play them.”</p>\n<p>UCSB earned their trip to the Honda Center after a come-from-behind victory at UC Irvine, in which the Gauchos allowed the Anteaters to score just 51 points, while on the offensive end, five players tallied at least eight points.</p>\n<p>“We have to keep our confidence up,” Zornig said. “We have to stick together as a team and keep playing how we’re playing. If we get it done on the defensive end, we’ll win.”</p>\n<p>The Gauchos will need to maintain its tenacious league-leading defense, which allows teams 52 points per game, because the Tigers love to score. They average 68.1 points per game, second in the Big West, and feature three of the top 12 scorers in guards Kendall Rodriguez, Erica McKenzie and Gena Johnson. The three average 35.3 points per game.</p>\n<p>“At the end of the day it’s about us and we just have to do what we do best,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Pacific is also third in conference in three-point shooting, hitting 32.9 percent of its threes and averaging 6.4 treys a game.</p>\n<p>UCSB has a threat from behind the arc too: senior forward Kelsey Adrian. Adrian ranks fifth in the Big West in three-point shooting (36.9 percent) and knocked down crucial threes in the last game against Irvine.</p>\n<p>In both games against Pacific, UCSB faltered down the stretch, allowing the Tigers to go on large unanswered runs. The first matchup was played evenly until Pacific went on a 10-0 run to seal the game. The second game saw a terrible performance by the Gauchos. After going down early, UCSB closed the gap to single digits, but then watched Pacific mount a 18-0 run in the second half. UCSB had just 15 points in the second period.</p>\n<p>Despite the inconsistency this season, Head Coach Carlene Mitchell has a better plan in mind that will make her team forget any loss and allow the two seniors to leave a great legacy.</p>\n<p>“When I knew realistically we were back in the corner as far as winning the conference this year and that’s what they came in here understanding as seniors, I [told them] that there would be no bigger legacy than being the surprise team, being the Cinderella story, winning the conference tournament, and having a chance to make a run at the NCAA’s,” Mitchell said.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 2:30 p.m.</p>\n<div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45561\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45561\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-09/gauchos-face-test-pacific/","id":741,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[740,739,738],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"UCSB Beats Irvine, Advances to Second Round","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"Despite being swept in the season series, the UCSB women’s basketball team beat UC Irvine 61-51 and will head to the Honda Center to continue their quest for a Big West Championship. “I’m excite...","content":"<div class=\"single-post-content\">\n            <p><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AnnieHall_wbball_vCSUF_020912-58.jpg?resize=206%2C312\" alt=\"\" width=\"206\" height=\"312\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">Despite being swept in the season series, the UCSB women’s basketball team beat UC Irvine 61-51 and will head to the Honda Center to continue their quest for a Big West Championship.</p>\n<p>“I’m excited for this team,” senior guard Emilie Johnson said. “I want nothing more than to see my team cut down nets.”</p>\n<p>It was a true team effort, as the Gauchos went in as the underdogs, but as the sixth seed beat the third seed Anteaters.

We’re not going to beat teams by outscoring them. Our mindset is defense.”</p>\n<p>However, it couldn’t have been a worse start for UC Santa Barbara, which threw the ball away in each of its first five possessions. The Gauchos didn’t score their first basket until over six minutes had gone by on a basket by freshman forward Jackie Luna-Castro.</p>\n<p>“One hundred percent, it was a nightmare start,” Mitchell said. “I was like, ‘this is not the time for this to be happening.’”</p>\n<p>After going down by double figures, UCSB finally woke up. Baskets by the two seniors, Johnson and Kelsey Adrian, sparked a 14-4 run. The Gauchos went into halftime down just two at 26-24.</p>\n<p>“Because of my competitive nature, I just told them we’re going to win,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, we knew we were going to the Honda Center.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after halftime, UCSB took its first lead. From there, it became the Zornig show. Zornig scored eight straight points for the Gauchos and consecutive baskets by sophomore guard Nicole Nesbit gave UCSB a 39-33 win with just over ten minutes to play.</p>\n<p>“[Zornig] was in attack mode,” Mitchell said. We definitely needed another scoring option, but she did just as well a job on the defensive job as well.”</p>\n<p>Freshman forward Methlyn Onomoguho responded with a 7-0 run of her own to give the Anteaters the lead, but consecutive baskets by Underwood and a critical three by Adrian extended the lead to four. That would be enough for UCSB to hang on and upset Irvine.</p>\n<p>“The key was staying poised and composed,” Johnson said. “At this point in the season, it’s a mental game. We just have to stay focused and live in the moment.”</p>\n<p>Senior guard Kassandra McCalister, who killed the Gauchos in the last two match-ups, was held to just five.</p>\n<p>UCSB will play Pacific at the Honda Center on Friday.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45322\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45322\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-07/ucsb-beats-irvine-advances/","id":738,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[737,736,735],"comments":[],"followers":[]},{"title":"Big West Tourney Begins With UC Irvine","category":"Sports","subcategory":"Basketball","publish_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00.000Z","full_thumbnail":"Not available","mobile_thumbnail":"Not available","description":"It’s win or go home as March Madness kicks off for the UCSB women’s basketball team, which will face UC Irvine on the road tonight.

Although she averages 13.7 points per game (fifth in the Big West), McCalister scored 21 points in the first matchup and then single-handedly destroyed the Gauchos in Irvine when she scored a career-high 36 points.</p>\n<p>“She’s a great player and she made a lot of tough shots [on] senior night,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully we can do some different things to slow her down. It will be a team effort.”</p>\n<p>If UCSB can uphold its league-leading, tenacious defense that allows teams just 50.9 points per game, it will certainly have a shot at a win because Irvine’s strategy is simple: outscore its opponent. UCSB gave up a season-worst 72 points in the last matchup.</p>\n<p>“They’re extremely athletic, and we had a lot of mistakes in the last game,” Mitchell said. “Hopefully if we can cut down on the turnovers and do the little things, we can [go] out on the road and get a win.”</p>\n<p>In both games, the Anteaters found a weakness in the Gaucho defense, taking advantage behind the three-point arc. Against the Gauchos this season, the Anteaters shot an incredible 50.5 percent from downtown.</p>\n<p>“We have to come out like we did [Saturday] and feel like we have nothing to lose,” senior forward Kelsey Adrian said. “We have to put it all out there and just fight. We know what kind of team we are.”</p>\n<p>After that great win at UC Davis, there was only one key to continuing the momentum, according to senior guard Emilie Johnson: “Consistency … that’s all I have to say.”</p>\n<p>That might sound like a cliché, but inconsistency has been a big issue for the Gauchos. Before the win at Davis, UCSB had a poor performance against Pacific. Nevertheless, the team enters the Big West tournament having won six of their last eight games.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully we feel confident after the game at Davis,” Mitchell said. “My goal was to have our team peaking at the right time, and I’m confident we’re playing to the best of our abilities.”</p>\n<p>Offensively, Johnson leads the team, averaging 9.4 points per game. If UCSB wants to prolong their season, other players are going to have to step up. Adrian comes off a tremendous performance at Davis, where she tallied a career-high 21 points and drained four threes, and junior forward Kirsten Tilleman, who has played well in both games against Irvine, averages 13 points and eight boards. Both players will be huge in giving the Gauchos an inside presence.</p>\n<p>Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. at the Bren Events Center.</p><div class=\"h5ab-print-button-container\"><div class=\"h5ab-print-button h5ab-print-button-left\" style=\"cursor: pointer; color: #555\"><i class=\"fa fa-print fa-lg\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Print</span></div></div>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-45287\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-45287\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-tumblr\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Tumblr\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-reddit\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/?share=reddit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Reddit\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></ul></div></div></div>\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>          </div>","src_url":"https://dailynexus.com/2012-03-06/big-west-tourney-begins-uc-irvine/","id":735,"author":{"id":71,"name":"Kristen Henneman"},"related":[734,733,732],"comments":[],"followers":[]}],"footerData":{"page":11,"highestPage":15,"route":"/authors/71"}},"__N_SSG":true}
